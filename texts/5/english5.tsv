They will discuss the war at a moment when Russia is escalating its airstrikes against civilian targets, and the humanitarian situation in several Ukrainian cities has worsened.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said on Wednesday that he hoped the meeting between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, would “crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire.”  Both Russia and Ukraine appear to have softened their stance in recent days, raising hopes that a cease-fire might just be possible.  The Kremlin has narrowed its demands to focus on Ukrainian “neutrality” and the status of its occupied regions, and signaled that President Vladimir V. Putin is no longer set on regime change in Kyiv.  On the Ukrainian side, President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that he is open to revising his country’s constitutionally enshrined aspiration to join NATO, and even to a compromise over the status of Ukrainian territory now controlled by Russia.  Mr. Zelensky said on Wednesday that he expected Mr. Putin to eventually cease hostilities and enter negotiations after watching his forces encounter fierce resistance in Ukraine. An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Russian troops have been killed during the two-week invasion, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, up sharply from an estimate of 3,000 just days ago.  “I think he sees that we are strong,” Mr. Zelensky told Vice News during an interview in Kyiv. “He will. We need some time.”  The talks on Thursday will be held in the Turkish city of Antalya, in a coastal region that has for years been a popular destination for Russian tourists.  Turkey is a more neutral location than Belarus, where the first three rounds of talks have been held. Mr. Erdogan has stopped short of imposing sanctions against Russia over the invasion, but his country is a NATO member that has provided Ukraine with lethal armed drones.  Yet the Russian and Ukrainian demands are still far apart.  The Kremlin said this week that it would halt military operations if Kyiv were to enshrine a status of neutrality in its constitution and recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of two Russia-backed separatist territories eastern Ukraine. That is still far from what Mr. Zelensky has said he would be willing to accept. Russia’s position could also puncture Mr. Putin’s image at home, opening him up to criticism that he waged a costly war for limited gain.  Even if Russia and Ukraine were to agree on a cease-fire, it would not necessarily mean the end of the war. Analysts caution that both sides could use it to build up strength ahead of a further escalation.  Mr. Kuleba said on Wednesday that his expectations for the talks in Turkey were low.  As Mr. Kuleba meets Mr. Lavrov, Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in Warsaw on Thursday with President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, a NATO ally on Ukraine’s western border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, who is visiting Poland this week, will also attend.  The United States and its NATO allies are trying to find ways to help Ukraine defend itself without getting pulled into a wider war against Russia. In a sign of how difficult that is proving, the United States and Poland publicly disagreed this week over proposals for sending Soviet-era fighter jets into the country.  Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the head of U.S. European Command, said in a statement early Thursday that the United States had “no plans to facilitate an indirect or third party transfer of Polish aircraft” to Ukraine.  Providing more air-defense systems and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine is the most effective way to support the country’s military, General Wolters said, and Ukrainian air defenses have been limiting the effectiveness of Russia’s significant air capabilities.  Transferring fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine would “not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force,” he added. It could also be “mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian escalation with NATO.”

Married in 2001, they lived in a bedroom community outside Kyiv, in an apartment with their two children and their dogs, Benz and Cake. She was an accountant and he was a computer programmer.  Serhiy and Tetiana Perebyinis owned a Chevrolet minivan. They shared a country home with friends, and Ms. Perebyinis was a dedicated gardener and an avid skier. She had just returned from a ski trip to Georgia.  And then, late last month, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the fighting quickly moved toward Kyiv. It wasn’t long before artillery shells were crashing into their neighborhood. One night, a shell hit their building, prompting Ms. Perebyinis and the children to move to the basement. Finally, with her husband away in eastern Ukraine tending to his ailing mother, Ms. Perebyinis decided it was time to take her children and run.  They didn’t make it. Ms. Perebyinis, 43, and her two children, Mykyta, 18, and Alisa, 9, along with a church volunteer who was helping them, Anatoly Berezhnyi, 26, were killed on Sunday as they dashed across the concrete remnants of a damaged bridge in their town of Irpin, trying to evacuate to Kyiv.

This is an exaggeration, but not much of one. The price of gasoline was already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and it has risen every day since then. As the most important measure of inflation that most Americans regularly see, this daily increase is a big problem in itself.  But it’s more than that: It’s a tax on working people, a drag on economic growth and a conspicuous emblem of the acute problems afflicting a range of financial assets, from stocks and bonds to commodities like gold, nickel and wheat.  These issues are minor compared with the anguish that the Russian onslaught has inflicted on Ukrainians. But it’s worth noting that both Russia’s brutal invasion as well as Western efforts to counter it and aid Ukraine are spilling over into global financial markets, affecting, in ways big and small, virtually everyone in the United States and around the world.

Mr. Biden warned that his ban on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal, announced on Tuesday as a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, would cause gas prices to rise further. High costs are expected to last as long as the confrontation does.  While Republican lawmakers supported the ban, they asserted that the pain at the pump long preceded the war in Ukraine. Gas price hikes, they said, were the result of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, the temporary halt on new drilling leases on public lands and the surrendering of “energy independence” — all incorrect assertions.  Here’s a fact check of their claims.  What Was Said  “This administration wants to ramp up energy imports from Iran and Venezuela. That is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror and a thuggish South America dictator, respectively. They would rather buy from these people than buy from Texas, Alaska and Pennsylvania.”  — Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, in a speech on Tuesday

The Omicron surge has worsened in Japan and other parts of Asia even as cases and deaths have slowed elsewhere. Credit... Koji Sasahara/Associated Press  The once severe Omicron wave that has retreated in much of the world is still flaring up in parts of East and Southeast Asia, where caseloads are rising and some countries are enduring their worst waves of the pandemic, the World Health Organization noted this week.  Many places in the region had kept caseloads fairly low throughout the pandemic because of their strict policies, including “zero Covid” approaches in mainland China and Hong Kong, as well as in New Zealand.  But the Omicron surge has worsened in parts of Asia since December — including in Japan, South Korea and Vietnam — and in Pacific island countries like New Zealand and Tonga. Tonga recorded its first community transmission of the coronavirus last month after aid workers came to help the island nation recover from a volcanic eruption and a subsequent tsunami.  Coronavirus policies in parts of Asia have generally been far stricter than in the Americas. Some countries in the Americas have eased those policies even further in the past few weeks as Omicron cases have dropped, a move that W.H.O. officials said on Wednesday was happening too soon.  The United States, along with Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Japan and Russia, reported high death counts from Feb. 28 to Sunday, the agency said. Germany and Russia were still reporting high caseloads — although the agency reported on Tuesday that new cases and deaths had slowed worldwide during that time period.  Last month, the agency said that a more contagious Omicron subvariant had been spreading quickly and had become dominant in Denmark and in several Asian countries, including Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. But on Tuesday the agency said that the predominant Omicron subvariant still accounted for slightly more cases globally. Some scientists had been concerned that the more contagious variant’s greater transmissibility could cause a fresh spike or prolong the Omicron wave.  Scientists had also wondered whether people infected with one Omicron subvariant could be reinfected with another. The W.H.O. reported that recent data from Qatar suggested that a previous infection with one Omicron subvariant may confer protection against others.  The agency said it had received reports of clusters of what it called recombinant variants, or variants that combined Delta and Omicron or different Omicron subvariants. But because such clusters have showed “very low to almost undetectable levels of transmission,” those variants have not been named.

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.44 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.  Tracking vaccination rates by country Charts show countries with at least 100,000 people  Less wealthy countries are relying on a vaccine-sharing arrangement called Covax, which originally aimed to provide two billion doses by the end of 2021 but repeatedly cut its forecasts because of production problems, export bans and vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.

This is how Americans describe the stresses and strains of life on the front lines of a changing climate. panic attacks Redlands, Calif. demoralizing Moss Landing, Calif. reclaim Cordova, Alaska unrecognizable Manton, Calif.  Experts and psychologists are racing to understand how the torments of a volatile, unpredictable planet shape our minds and mental health. In February, a major new study highlighted the mental health effects of climate change for the first time, saying that anxiety and stress from a changing climate were likely to increase in coming years. In addition to those who have lost their homes to floods and megafires, millions have endured record-breaking heat waves. The crisis also hits home in subtle, personal ways — withered gardens, receding lakeshores and quiet walks without the birdsong that once accompanied them. To understand what the effects of climate change feel like in America today, we heard from hundreds of people. In cities already confronting the long-term effects of climate change, and in drought-scarred ranches and rangeland, many are trying to cope with the strains of an increasingly precarious future.  CC Play again Alana Quintasket is a Swinomish tribal senator in Washington State. Warming seas and rivers are threatening ecosystems that are a lifeblood of tribal economies and cultures.  The feelings are complex. Some people grieve the loss of serene hiking trails that have been engulfed by wildfire smoke while others no longer find the same joy or release from nature. Some are seeking counseling. Others are harnessing their anxiety by protesting for change or working to slow the damage. “​​This is becoming a No. 1 threat to mental health,” said Britt Wray, a Stanford University researcher and author of “Generation Dread,” a forthcoming book about grappling with climate distress. “It can make day-to-day life incredibly hard to go on.” Psychologists and therapists say the distress of a changing climate can cause fleeting anxiety for some people but trigger much darker thoughts for others. In a 2020 survey, more than half of Americans reported feeling anxious about the climate’s impact on their mental health, and more than two-thirds said they were anxious about how climate change would affect the planet.  CC Play again Todd Tanner hunts and fishes in western Montana. Founder of the nonprofit Conservation Hawks, he sees firsthand the grim changes in the forests and rivers around him.  Young people say they are especially upset. A survey of people 16 to 25 in 10 countries published in The Lancet found that three-quarters were frightened of the future. More than half said humanity was doomed. Some feel betrayed by older generations and leaders. They say they feel angry but helpless as they watch people in power fail to act swiftly. Almost 40 percent of young people say they are hesitant about having children. If nature feels this unmoored today, some ask, why bring children into an even grimmer future? Some of the worst physical effects of climate change are disproportionately felt by Black and Latino communities and Indigenous nations — who often live in places with a legacy of mining, energy drilling and other pollution. And while these groups are among the most concerned about the changing climate, community resources to deal with the emotional fallout may be more limited.  CC Play again Tonyisha Harris is a young climate activist from Chicago’s South Side. Despite the work she does, she worries that climate change is robbing her generation and community of a future they deserve.  Experts are quick to emphasize that people are justified in their emotional response. The threat is real and growing as carbon levels in the atmosphere pass dangerous new thresholds. With rising temperatures, extreme weather events will become more and more common. “Sometimes I feel hopeless or sad or worried,” said Andrew Bryant, a social worker in Seattle who treats patients with climate anxieties. “That’s part of being a human being at this point if we’re paying attention.”  I lost a piece of my heart with the trees that I will never get back.

Kauʻi Baumhofer Merritt, 39, Makakilo, Hawaii.  A new world of drenching hurricanes and deadlier summer heat is also straining professions that once seemed removed from the front lines of climate change. Hospitals and police officers in the Pacific Northwest grappled with 500 heat deaths when temperatures shattered records last summer. Along the Gulf, emergency workers are facing down larger, more frequent storms that make their jobs even more dangerous. “We want to believe that the world we live in won’t change very much,” said Susan Clayton, a professor at the College of Wooster and one of the first researchers to highlight climate anxiety. “But the very ground under our feet, the things we take for granted, can change.”  CC Play again ​​Laura Russell is a paramedic in New Orleans.

Instead, he and Mr. Kovalchuk obsess over the past. A French diplomat told me that President Emmanuel Macron of France was astonished when Mr. Putin gave him a lengthy history lecture during one of their talks last month. He shouldn’t have been surprised.  In his mind, Mr. Putin finds himself in a unique historical situation in which he can finally recover for the previous years of humiliation. In the 1990s, when Mr. Putin and Mr. Kovalchuk first met, they were both struggling to find their footing after the fall of the Soviet Union, and so was the country. The West, they believe, took advantage of Russia’s weakness to push NATO as close as possible to the country’s borders. In Mr. Putin’s view, the situation today is the opposite: It is the West that’s weak. The only Western leader that Mr. Putin took seriously was Germany’s previous chancellor, Angela Merkel. Now she is gone and it’s time for Russia to avenge the humiliations of the 1990s.  It seems that there is no one around to tell him otherwise. Mr. Putin no longer meets with his buddies for drinks and barbecues, according to people who know him. In recent years — and especially since the start of the pandemic — he has cut off most contacts with advisers and friends. While he used to look like an emperor who enjoyed playing on the controversies of his subjects, listening to them denounce one another and pitting them against one another, he is now isolated and distant, even from most of his old entourage.  His guards have imposed a strict protocol: No one can see the president without a week’s quarantine — not even Igor Sechin, once his personal secretary, now head of the state-owned oil company Rosneft. Mr. Sechin is said to quarantine for two or three weeks a month, all for the sake of occasional meetings with the president.  In “All the Kremlin’s Men” I described the phenomenon of the “collective Putin” — the way his entourage always tried to eagerly anticipate what the president would want. These cronies would tell Mr. Putin exactly what he wanted to hear. The “collective Putin” still exists: The whole world saw it on the eve of the invasion when he summoned top officials, one by one, and asked them their views on the coming war. All of them understood their task and submissively tried to describe the president’s thoughts in their own words.

In this conversation, Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, unpacks how this conflict is evolving in the cyber realm.  [You can listen to this episode of “Sway” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]  Kara Swisher asks Neuberger how, in the face of attacks on Ukrainian banks and the Defense Ministry, the U.S. government “is working directly with Ukraine on cybersecurity” and why the Russians didn’t strike early on with the large-scale cyberattacks many experts had expected to see — similar to the 2015 attack that took out Ukraine’s electrical grid. They discuss how cyber tensions between Russia and the U.S. may escalate, with Neuberger clarifying that when the secretary of state reaffirmed this week that the U.S. and NATO “will defend every, every inch of NATO territory should it come under attack,” he was speaking not only of ground attacks, but also cyberattacks. And Kara presses Neuberger on whether the administration should have responded to the SolarWinds hack that infiltrated the Pentagon and the State Department with more than economic sanctions — and whether U.S. cyber policy has enough teeth to really deter Putin.

You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays.  A specter is haunting Russia — the specter of cancellation.  As Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third week, conscientious consumers and businesses across the West have retaliated through what can be described only as a mass cultural boycott.  In Russia, Disney and Warner Bros. have paused theatrical releases, and McDonald’s, Starbucks and Coca-Cola have suspended their business operations. In the United States, liquor stores and supermarkets have pulled Russian vodka from their shelves, and the Metropolitan Opera cut ties with one of its most acclaimed sopranos after she criticized the war but refused to distance herself from Putin. And in the international arena, Eurovision, FIFA and the Paralympic Games have banned Russians from participating in this year’s competitions.

Putin, he says, “understands that he cannot conquer Ukraine and integrate it into a greater Russia or into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union.” And if the United States only worked harder “to create friendly relations” with Moscow, Mearsheimer argues, there could be a tacit American-Russian “balancing coalition” against the rising power of China.  But why should Putin necessarily be immune from the hubris and delusions of Western leaders? Why should we assume that he doesn’t dream of reintegrating Ukraine and Belarus into a greater Russia? Why should we take for granted that the right diplomatic strategy will bring him into an American coalition against China, when he might instead be committed to a sweeping ideological vision of Eurasian power aligned against the decadent West?  Why should we assume, in other words, that structural and schematic explanations of Putin’s war are more important than personal and ideological explanations? After all, as the historian Adam Tooze points out, it appears that very few members of the Russian foreign policy elite — all presumably opponents of NATO expansion, all “devotees to Russia’s future as a great power” — actually believed that Putin would invade. And if so many participants in Putin’s regime, all good servants of the national interest as realists define it, wouldn’t have made his fateful choice, then did realist premises actually predict the war itself?  Just as important, did they predict the way the war has played out so far? I myself did not: My assumption was that Ukraine might mount a strong resistance in the western part of its territory, but that Russia would sweep pretty easily to the Dnieper and probably put Volodymyr Zelensky’s government to flight. (Some version of this assumption was shared by U.S. intelligence, which was predicting the quick fall of Kyiv two days into the war.) After almost two weeks of stalled-out offensives and mounting Russian casualties, that faulty assumption does look a bit like a Risk-board view of the world, where all that matters is positioning and pieces, not patriotism, morale, leadership and luck.  And there are a lot of ways that this kind of Risk-board mentality can deceive. Flash back a few decades, for instance, to the late Cold War, and a crude realist analysis might have insisted that Poland would always be in some kind of deep thrall to Russia — because it had so often been dominated by Moscow, its geography left it so open to invasion from the east, and so on — and that it was strategic folly to imagine otherwise. But Polish leadership and patriotism, Soviet weakness and unexpected historical events all contrived to change that calculus, so that today Poland’s strategic independence and Western alignment, while hardly invulnerable, both look relatively secure.  Is it unrealistic for Kyiv to aspire to what Warsaw has gained? Right now I would still say yes. But is it impossible, in the way that some realist thinking tends to suggest — as though some law of physics binds Ukraine to Russia? No: I think anyone watching this war so far, watching both the struggles of the Russian military and the solidifying of a Ukrainian national consciousness, would have to give more credit to long-term Ukrainian ambitions, and a little less to the inevitability of Russian regional dominance.  So those are two places where realist theory, or at least certain intellectual temptations associated with realism, has suffered from its contact with the reality of war so far.

Yet with Russia we have a case where the opposite is going on. Big companies are taking bold steps to punish Russia that for many will noticeably hurt profits.  These measures have drawbacks beyond the hit to corporate earnings. The withdrawals of foreign companies and the suspensions of their services will hurt ordinary Russians, not just President Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs. In some cases the actions of companies will also hurt nations that are allied against Russia. Reducing or stopping purchases of oil and natural gas are obvious examples: Western leaders exempted fossil fuels from sanctions precisely to protect their citizens from high gas prices, but the big oil companies such as Shell are foiling that plan by voluntarily ceasing crude purchases. (On Tuesday, President Biden essentially caught up with the private sector by banning U.S. imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal, of which the United States isn’t a big customer anyway.)  There’s even a possible military implication to the corporate enthusiasm for protest. Putin has said he regards allies’ sanctions as “akin to a declaration of war.” If companies go beyond what heads of state and diplomats intend in terms of severing Russia from the global economy, they could inadvertently prompt a response from the Kremlin — possibly cyberattacks.  Given all those downsides, why are so many companies going to such extremes to punish Russia? Responding to public opinion is clearly a factor. But I think it’s also because the executives in charge are people, too — they’re as appalled as everyone else by the death and destruction that Putin is visiting on Ukraine. Chief executive officers want to be able to say they took meaningful action “when they go home and sit down with their wife and kids,” Keith Krach, a former Silicon Valley executive who was appointed under secretary of state during the Trump administration, told me.  More pragmatically, the chief executives of multinational corporations also see their actions as helping to provide “global economic security,” Krach added. In trying to undermine Putin they’re not just serving the countries where they’re headquartered, he said: “It is like patriotism for the free world. It’s not just national security.”

Frances Lee, a political scientist at Princeton, made the case in an email that  It would be a major historical anomaly if Democrats retain control of the House in 2022. One of the most predictable features of American politics is the loss of seats in Congress for the president’s party at the midterm. Even presidents with majority public approval still almost always see losses for their party in Congress. With Democrats’ margin so narrow, the party just cannot spare any losses.  Biden’s favorability rating, currently averaging 41.6 percent according to Real Clear Politics, would have to rise “above 60 percent — like George W. Bush in 2002 or Bill Clinton in 1998 — before it would become reasonable to expect Democrats to avert a loss of House control,” Lee observed. “Since the advent of public opinion polling, all presidents with approval ratings below 60 percent have seen losses of congressional seats at the midterm, in every case more than the 5 seats that Democrats can spare in 2022.”  Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm, provided historical data to The Times based on Gallup polling and House election outcomes in nonpresidential contests from 1962 to 2018. When the president’s approval rating was 60 percent or higher, the president’s party gained one seat; when the rating was in the 49 percent to 59 percent range, the president’s party lost an average of 12 seats; when the favorability rating fell below 49 percent, the average loss was 39 House seats. Biden, with eight months until the midterms, is well below that mark.  The picture, according to Lee,  is not entirely bleak. The employment recovery is strong; the pandemic seems to be abating. The battle for the Senate is more evenly matched, and Republicans have come up short in some high-profile candidate recruitment efforts. But Democrats have no margin for error. Any losses given a 50-50 balance will tip Senate control to Republicans. In a midterm year, one would have to rate that outcome as the more likely outcome.  Lee suggested that “the more plausible question for Biden is how bad things are likely to get for Democrats.”  She pointed out:  Thirty House Democrats have already retired rather than run for re-election. Inflation is expected to be running well above Federal Reserve targets through the rest of 2022. Even though Biden has been able to rally the democratic world in opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, few experts expect a favorable outcome of the conflict on any near-term horizon. The pandemic has defied predictions to date, and public patience is wearing thinner.  Charlie Cook, the founder of the Cook Political Report, argued in an email that Biden is in a deep hole very difficult to climb out of:  Between the Mexican border, not anticipating a rush across the border when Trump left town, being caught flat-footed, Kabul made the fall of Saigon look fairly dignified, ignoring/dismissing inflation. The worst sin for most voters, inflation, hurts 100 percent of people, a totally unrealistic legislative agenda, party line vote on coronavirus package, 7.5 months to get half of what they wanted on infrastructure, he has pretty much soiled his nest. Republican voters are hyper-motivated, Democratic voters lethargic, independents alienated, doesn’t sound terribly promising to me.  Alex Theodoridis, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, is pessimistic about Democratic prospects, but less so than Cook.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Theodoridis wrote by email, “is an awkward one for GOP elites and voters. They have spent the last few years downplaying the nefariousness of Putin’s regime and portraying Ukraine as a hopelessly corrupt hotbed of profiteering for the Biden family.”  This message, he continued, has  trickled down to the Republican rank-and-file. UMass Poll data from 2020 and 2021 show that Republicans, on average, rate Democrats, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and even people who vote for Democrats, as greater threats to America than Vladimir Putin and Russia. In the weeks before the invasion, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, among others, peddled takes flattering to Putin. This stance has grown uncomfortable as Russia and Putin have clearly played the role of unprovoked aggressor and Ukrainians and Zelensky emerge as both sympathetic and heroic.  But, in Theodoridis’s view, the “positive signs for Biden and Democrats over the last couple weeks” do not “yet rise to the level of changing the expectation that 2022 will likely follow the historical pattern of midterm loss for the president’s party. And, Democrats have precious little margin with which to sustain any loss of seats.”

Surely Russia’s huge military would take Kyiv and other major cities within a few days; surely the West would respond with its usual timidity, giving Russia no more than a minor slap on the wrist.  Instead, here we are, 13 days in, with Kyiv and Kharkiv still standing and invading forces bogged down by fierce Ukrainian resistance (helped by a rapid influx of Western weapons) and disastrous logistical problems. At the same time, Western sanctions on the Russian economy are clearly already having severe effects and may get even stronger.  Obviously all this could change: Russian forces could regroup and resume the offensive; weak-kneed Western governments could start lifting sanctions. For now, however, Putin is facing far worse consequences than he could have imagined.  Unfortunately, standing up to aggression doesn’t come free. Events in Ukraine and Russia will, in particular, impose serious costs on the world economy. The question is, how serious?

But because this is solely his war and he cannot admit defeat, he could keep doubling down in Ukraine until … until he contemplates using a nuclear weapon.  Why do I say that defeat in Ukraine is Putin’s only option, that only the timing and size are in question? Because the easy, low-cost invasion he envisioned and the welcome party from Ukrainians he imagined were total fantasies — and everything flows from that.  Putin completely underestimated Ukraine’s will to be independent and become part of the West. He completely underestimated the will of many Ukrainians to fight, even if it meant dying, for those two goals. He completely overestimated his own armed forces. He completely underestimated President Biden’s ability to galvanize a global economic and military coalition to enable Ukrainians to stand and fight and to devastate Russia at home — the most effective U.S. coalition-building effort since George H.W. Bush made Saddam Hussein pay for his folly of seizing Kuwait. And he completely underestimated the ability of companies and individuals all over the world to participate in, and amplify, economic sanctions on Russia — far beyond anything governments initiated or mandated.  When you get that many things wrong as a leader, your best option is to lose early and small. In Putin’s case that would mean withdrawing his forces from Ukraine immediately; offering a face-saving lie to justify his “special military operation,” like claiming it successfully protected Russians living in Ukraine; and promising to help Russians’ brethren rebuild. But the inescapable humiliation would surely be intolerable for this man obsessed with restoring the dignity and unity of what he sees as the Russian motherland.  Incidentally, the way things are going on the ground in Ukraine right now, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Putin could actually lose early and big. I would not bet on it, but with every passing day that more and more Russian soldiers are killed in Ukraine, who knows what happens to the fighting spirit of the conscripts in the Russian Army being asked to fight a deadly urban war against fellow Slavs for a cause that was never really explained to them.

But the league is working with police services in some of its 32 team cities to provide extra patrols around the arenas and homes of players.  Milstein said his Russian clients on N.H.L. rosters want nothing to do with the war in Ukraine but fear the consequences of speaking out.  “Of course, they’re worried not only about their families but also they are extremely worried about what is happening in Russia,” he said. “My clients don’t want the war, my clients want world peace. My clients are concerned for all the people in Ukraine and Russia, everybody.”  The hockey equipment maker CCM said last week it would stop using Ovechkin and other Russian players in global marketing campaigns.  Russian and Belarusian players and teams have been barred from all international competitions by the International Ice Hockey Federation. They also face calls for sanctions from fans, some governments and even the Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky.  Gretzky, 61, and still one of the most influential people in hockey, called for Russia to be barred from the rescheduled 2022 men’s world junior tournament shortly before the I.I.H.F. barred the country. He later explained on the Toronto radio station Sportsnet 590 that he was thinking of the large numbers of people of Ukrainian descent who live in Canada, especially Edmonton, where the tournament will be played in August.  “I just couldn’t relate to how we were going to welcome a country that is at war, to a city that has tons of Ukrainian family members that are still living in Ukraine,” said Gretzky, who won four Stanley Cup championships with Edmonton. “And I got some pushback from people that said, ‘Why punish the Russian kids?’

For the oil companies, three decades of carefully nurturing investments in what was always a difficult political environment is poised to quickly go by the boards. But the high point of Western involvement in Russia passed years ago, pushed along in part by outrage over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.  The Russian oil industry, though, is likely to experience a wrenching reworking about how it does business in the coming weeks, months and even years. In the short term, this painful reckoning will come not so much because blue-chip oil companies are leaving, but because Russian oil and gas have suddenly become toxic to many buyers.  On Tuesday, President Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports to the United States, a move aimed at further penalizing Russia. Earlier in the day, Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said it would stop buying the country’s oil and gas and “withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons.”

One simply said, “Go Home.”  That would have been difficult for Sveta Savchitz, who is 64 years old and moved here from Ukraine in 1993. More than 25 years later, when she and her son, Alan Aguichev, opened the restaurant, they decided to market it as Russian because they thought it would have more name recognition. “It’s very similar cuisine-wise,” Mr. Aguichev said. “The main difference is whoever is cooking the food.”  These days, there’s name recognition, but not in a good way. So last week, they changed all the language describing Sveta online from “Russian” to “Eastern European.”  Russian restaurants in New York City have a public relations problem. Even though many of the owners are openly against the war, or are even Ukrainian, they are getting burned by reservation cancellations, social media campaigns and bad reviews online at a time when restaurants, in general, are still reeling from the shutdowns and restrictions of Covid-19.

Four people lay near an intersection in Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, on Sunday. All were dead or soon would be, from the force of Russian mortars. There had been no Ukrainian forces where the mortars landed, suggesting Russia might have been targeting a civilian escape route near Kyiv.  If so, it was part of Russia’s larger campaign to demoralize Ukraine by killing and wounding ordinary people, a strategy the Russian military has also used in Syria and Chechnya. Ukraine is now enduring these attacks every day, many of them undocumented.  In Irpin, however, a team of Times journalists happened to be nearby when the mortar shells landed, and one of them, Lynsey Addario, took the photograph of the family. “I thought, you know, it’s disrespectful to take a photo, but I have to take a photo — this is a war crime,” Lynsey told CBS Evening News. “I think it’s really important that people around the world see these images.”

Davis Lin and Elisheba Ittoop and  Listen and follow The Daily  Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher  It has been two weeks since the beginning of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s high-tech army of nearly 200,000 soldiers has not taken control of any major cities, except the southern port of Kherson. The Ukrainian resistance has been too strong.  The state of the war is eerily stalled.  The Russians’ answer has been to encircle cities and, from a distance, bomb what they can’t control. Apartment buildings, factories, universities, hospitals — Russia’s hits have been indiscriminate.  Today, we hear dispatches on two cities in Ukraine’s south that are surrounded and under attack.

Biden: They’re going to go up. Memoli: What can you do about it? Biden: Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible.  Is this going to work? We asked about a dozen pollsters, political strategists and opinion experts, and got some interesting answers. They break down into roughly three camps:  Democratic strategists are happy with the new message and optimistic that it will at least stabilize their poll numbers and help their candidates. “Every fight needs a villain, and right now, there’s no better one than Putin,” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic political consultant and pollster. Privately, they say that linking gas prices to Putin and oil companies is the White House’s best option, though it’s hard to tell what will resonate in November.  Independent pollsters and analysts generally say that voters do seem willing to make sacrifices to help Ukraine and punish Russia, but are less likely to respond to Democrats’ attacks on Big Oil. “It matters how long would it be in effect, how much the increase would be and whether that step would be seen as being successful,” said Dina Smeltz, who studies public opinion as a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “It’s a potential game changer, which he badly needs on inflation,” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “But he has to hammer away daily with Dems chiming in and stay on message. ‘Putin and populism’ every day, and with a Democrat supporting chorus.”  Republicans are confident that inflation and gas prices are their ticket back to power, and scoff at Democrats’ latest attempt to redirect voters’ frustration away from Biden. “​​It would be one thing if gas prices were suddenly high as a result of this crisis and the Biden administration could clearly point to the Ukraine situation as a driver,” said Kristen Soltis Anderson, a partner at Echelon Insights, a Republican polling firm. “The challenge they will face is that voters have been concerned about cost of living for some time now.”  ‘Damaging for consumer sentiment’  Anderson has a point there: Democrats have struggled for months to fend off Republican attacks about high gas prices, which had been rising since April 2020 — well before the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the average price of gas was $4.25 a gallon across the United States, according to AAA.  “High gas prices tend to be quite damaging for consumer sentiment, because they are so salient, and in the short run, many people cannot really change the amount of driving they have to do,” said Carola Binder, an economist at Haverford College in Pennsylvania.  Gas prices are closely tied with inflation, which is increasing at a pace not seen in four decades.  That means it might be harder for Democrats to blame the war in Ukraine for, say, the rising prices of bacon or used cars.

He was 84.  His daughter Ekaterina Bankovskaya said the cause was cancer.  With Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine and the possibility that NATO could become involved, it may be hard to recall a time when Russia, Ukraine and the United States worked together to reduce a looming threat to global security.  It started in 1991, when the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union presented Russia, Ukraine and other successor states with an enormous challenge: how to make sure that an estimated 25,000 nuclear weapons, most of which were sitting in far-flung and often poorly secured sites, did not fall into the hands of criminals and terrorists.  It was up to General Maslin, who oversaw the 30,000 soldiers and engineers charged with maintaining Russia’s nuclear portfolio, to come up with an answer. He spent three years persuading Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus to hand over their atomic inheritance, only to hit on another snag: Russia didn’t have the means to keep the weapons safe either.

The form has continued to thrive in Britain, thanks largely to the BBC, but it faded in America after the mid-20th century, becoming a niche sustained by organizations including National Public Radio, which aired Earplay from the 1970s through the 1990s, and L.A. Theater Works, which has more than 600 audio titles in an expanding catalog featuring works by Dominique Morisseau and Tom Stoppard, as well as Miller and Ibsen.  The pandemic renewed flirtation with the form: When theaters were closed to protect public health, many turned to audio, as well as video, to continue making work and reaching audiences. But Audible, which says it has subscribers in 175 countries who listened to 3.4 billion hours of audio last year, has the potential to have much further reach because of its huge base of subscribers, and the deep pockets of Amazon.  “There’s a lot of audio drama being made by independent people for love, not money, but Audible is able to invest a lot more than independent productions are,” said Neil Verma, an assistant professor of sound studies at Northwestern University who has written about radio drama. “They have the opportunity to experiment, to attract more expensive talent if they want, and they also have the ability to distribute in a way that other entities don’t.”  Audible has released plays in Spanish and Hindi, as well as in English. “Our theater titles have been listened to by millions globally,” said Kate Navin, the artistic producer of Audible’s theater division, which has five full-time employees. “We end up getting in front of a lot of people.”  Verma said that one looming question is how long Audible will stay committed to theater. “They’re a tech company, so they try a lot of new things that survive or dissolve,” he said. “Radio drama has never been central to the mandate of any of the entities that have made it — it’s always been a side element of whatever the larger project is — so in that sense it’s always a little vulnerable.”

Yale University Press. $32.50.  We’ve come a long way, baby.  Maybe?  That’s the general sentiment evoked by “Woman: The American History of an Idea,” by Lillian Faderman, an ambitious attempt to delineate nothing less than the changing state of being female in this country over the past four centuries. “Woman” is exhaustively researched and finely written, with more than 100 pages of endnotes. Its bold red-orange spine would look handsome nestled next to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED Talk-turned-best seller “We Should All Be Feminists” and Rebecca Solnit’s “Men Explain Things to Me,” or for that matter “Woman: An Intimate Geography,” by Natalie Angier.  This “Woman” is dense with people and events, covering everything from Puritan poets to the pill to Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head; featuring reformers, revolutionaries and reactionaries both famous and obscure. But it doesn’t really sink into the psyche as one might expect, given that Faderman is one of the pre-eminent L.G.B.T.Q. scholars of our time — recognizing that not many were permitted to exist in previous times. It’s kind of a Gyncyclopedia Britannica in a Wiki, tricky world of identity politics: impressive but not essential.  Faderman’s most heralded works, “Surpassing the Love of Men” (1981) and (1999), are bedrocks of lesbian history. A professor emerita at California State University, Fresno, she has written many other books, most recently a slender biography of the gay rights leader Harvey Milk. Her memoir “Naked in the Promised Land” (2003), reissued two years ago with an introduction by Carmen Maria Machado, is captivating. Faderman even wrote a memoir about her mother. Some of us have to be reminded to call our mothers.  “Woman” starts strong, with an account of “pachucas,” the rebellious and daringly dressed Mexican American girls who were Faderman’s junior high-school classmates in the 1950s, often forced to go to charm school or “juvi,” and with whom she sympathized, aware that her own sexuality made her outré: “a fugitive from the ideal.” The pachucas return in a later chapter, as one of many groups to flout the established norm, including roller derby skaters, flappers, riot grrrls, temperance activists wielding hatchets, Chinese American suffragists in three-cornered feathered hats and, to my surprise, hoboes, “mooching” in army breeches. “For thousands of women, the Depression was oddly liberating,” Faderman writes. “They were poor and footloose, and they found a fresh way to snub conventions about how a woman ought to live.” Given the scope of her project, however, we only visit each of these fascinating subcultures for a short time.

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

Bellingcat, the specialist open source investigators, said they had geolocated the video, to a lightly inhabited area on the E95 road heading towards Kyiv – a direct route to the east of the capital where Russian forces are trying to mass.  Bellingcat (@bellingcat) This video of a Russian military column coming under attack and retreating was geolocated to 50.587111, 30.837889 by @MrWolfih and confirmed by Bellingcat. Filmed in Brovary, northeast of Kyiv. https://t.co/fj8ukOgip0 pic.twitter.com/oc8dV4OOIR  The well produced 45 second video circulating is a montage of the fighting on the road, with audio that appears to be a Russian commander reporting the attack to his superiors and the death of a regiment leader. That could also suggest the battle filmed did not take place today.    One Russian military expert who reviewed the video, Rob Lee, a former US marine and PhD student at King’s College London, said he thought this displayed “very poor tactics” on the part of the Russians, with a force clearly positioned “on an obvious avenue of approach”.

Abramovich was found by the UK government to have “received preferential treatment and concessions” from the Kremlin and through his business links been “involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence” of the eastern European country.  The Foreign Office said he was implicated through a steel manufacturing and mining company, Evraz plc, in which he had a significant shareholding and over which he exercised effective control.  It said the firm may have supplied steel to the Russian military for the production of tanks.  Abramovich’s assets have been frozen, and he will be prohibited from making any transactions in the UK, as well as being subject to a travel ban.  The share price of Evraz, a firm which is incorporated in London but with mostly Russian assets, slumped by as much as 13% on Thursday morning, following the announcement. Abramovich’s stake was worth £1.4bn at the end of 2021, but had plummeted to £320m on Wednesday evening.  It is the first time Abramovich has been subjected to sanctions by the UK or any of its allies.  The other Russian oligarchs hit with sanctions on Thursday morning were Igor Sechin, Oleg Deripaska, Andrey Kostin, Alexei Miller, Nikolai Tokarev and Dmitri Lebedev.  Deripaska was Abramovich’s one-time business partner, Sechin was said by the Foreign Office to have been Putin’s “right-hand man”, and Kostin, Miller, Tokarev and Lebedev were labelled as part of the Russian president’s “inner circle”.  Deripaska owns 45% of London-listed mining company En+ Group, whose executive chair until Monday was the Conservative party peer Lord Greg Barker. Deripaska’s stake was worth £1.6bn on Wednesday evening.  Sechin is the chief executive of state-owned oil company Rosneft and formerly Russia’s deputy prime minister. France last week seized a superyacht that it said belonged to Sechin, although Rosneft has denied he owned it.  Kostin is chair of the management board of Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB Bank. The bank, which was traded on the London Stock Exchange before the invasion, has also had sanctions imposed directly.  Miller is the chair of the management committee of Gazprom, the state-controlled gas producer that was formerly a major sponsor of European football.  Nikolai Tokarev is chair of Transneft, a major oil and gas company.  Dmitri Lebedev is the chair of the board of Bank Rossiya, said by the EU to be the “personal bank of senior officials of the Russian Federation”.  Boris Johnson said the move was a demonstration of the UK’s “unwavering support for the Ukrainian people”. The prime minister added: “We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.”  The sanctions against Abramovich have huge repercussions for Chelsea Football Club, which Abramovich was in the process of trying to sell. Ministers have effectively blocked that process.  A government source told the Guardian they would consider an application for a licence to allow sale of the club – but that it would not be granted if it benefited Abramovich while he was subject to sanctions.  Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said a special licence had been issued to allow games to be played, staff to be paid and existing ticket holder to attend matches but that Abramovich would be deprived of benefiting from his ownership of the club.  “I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,” she added.  David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said sanctions against Abramovich was the right decision but overdue.  “Too few oligarchs linked to Putin’s rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,” he said. “We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.  “It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.”  Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich’s lawyers had argued that he did not fit the criteria for sanctions, and said: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.”  Sanctions have been imposed against 204 people in the UK, and 65 entities.  The government has been criticised for being too slow to impose sanctions, given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began just over two weeks ago.  Critics said that those oligarchs fearing they could have their assets frozen would have speedily worked to move these out of the country.

The home secretary’s announcement, responding to an urgent Commons question from her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, follows increasing criticism about the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK.  Many have gone to Calais, to find out they could not apply for visas there, and were sent to other cities. A number of UK consular offices had very limited numbers of appointments.  From Tuesday, Patel told the Commons, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel.  “In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain,” she said.  “This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports.” This will only be the case for people with passports, not ID cards, she said.  Cooper welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment “a total, total disgrace, bringing shame on to our country”.  “I have to say to the home secretary – why does it always take being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?” Cooper asked.  Cooper queried why the changes were only being made now “when she has had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine”, saying Patel should accept an offer of help from the armed forces.  “It is deeply wrong to leave people in this terrible state,” Cooper said. “Our country is better than this. If she can’t get this sorted out, frankly she should hand the job over to somebody else who can.”  In her statement, Patel defended the decision to make checks on Ukrainian nationals before they came, saying she had sought advice from the security services before making the change.  Replying to Cooper, Patel insisted the government was taking a “pragmatic and agile approach” to visas. It was important for arrivals in the country to have proper documentation, she added, citing the Windrush scandal as an example of the problems that can otherwise occur.  Patel has also come under increasing pressure over recent days from fellow Conservative MPs to speed up the visa process.  Responding to her statement, a series of Tory backbenchers praised the change of stance but called for more to be done. One, Steve Baker, queried why a visa centre in Warsaw was closed from 5pm at weekdays, and all weekend, while former minister Robert Buckland asked her to better coordinate UK officials in the response, calling it “a crisis that will not wait”.  While EU nations are allowing Ukrainian nationals to stay long-term without visas, the only routes to the UK are existing ones, either for people with family ties, or if they are sponsored by an individual or organisation.

The Ukrainian president shared video footage showing massive destruction at the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – in the southern port city that has been under relentless bombardment for nine days.  “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?” said Zelenskiy on Telegram.  “Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.”  The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric” while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports.  US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and “the crimes against humanity that [Vladimir] Putin is committing”, including the maternity hospital air strike. “This is the beast that Putin is,” Pelosi said.  Pelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. “All of us will have to do more” to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies.  The US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing.  “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted.  01:25 Children's and maternity hospital hit by Russian bombs, say Ukraine authorities – video  The concerns came as UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of the Ukraine forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so.  As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded.  A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage.  The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.”  The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack.  The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis.  Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements.  The Russian army had also “shot and bombed” a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to.  On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine.  Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not.  Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia.  The conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN’s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw “no critical impact on safety” at Chernobyl, location of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there.  But it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control.  The UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion.  Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation.  In other developments:  Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials.  Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.” The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc’s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine’s request to join the EU  The US is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday.  Nestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris and Sony on Wednesday joined the list of multinationals stepping back from the country.  Agencies contributed to this report

Talks got under way near Antalya amid an outpouring of international outrage over Russia’s attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol. The bombing of the 600-bed children’s and maternity hospital that injured pregnant women was evidence of “genocide” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. The White House called the attack barbaric.  As western leaders condemned the bombing, Ukraine’s foreign minister and officials were pictured sitting opposite the Russian delegation as the brief talks that Kuleba described as both “easy and difficult” got under way.  In comments after the talks broke up, Lavrov said the hospital had been under the control of “Ukrainian radicals” and denied that any patients were present. He said the west had caused the conflict by forcing Ukraine to choose between Russia and the west.  Kuleba called for Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. He said Ukraine was ready for diplomacy but also able to defend itself as it appeared that Russia would fight on and was seeking a surrender from Kyiv.  Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who brokered the meeting, said before it began that the aim was to pave the way for talks between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy, facilitated by Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayip Erdoğan. Turkey, which is a Nato member and which has not imposed sanctions on Russia but has condemned the attack and allowed Turkish-built drones to be bought by Ukraine, is trying to position itself as a neutral broker in the conflict.  The Kremlin has said it would stop the war if Ukraine ceased military action, enshrined in its constitution that it had no plans to join Nato, gave up annexed Crimea and recognised the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.  EU leaders, meanwhile, prepared to meet at Versailles to discuss Ukraine’s application to join their ranks.  Ahead of the Versailles summit, convened by France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Kuleba stepped up the pressure on the EU to grant Ukraine a fast-track route to membership. Recounting a phone call he had with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Kuleba tweeted that he had “underscored the historic importance of granting EU membership to Ukraine which now fights for itself and entire Europe”.  While Ukraine’s membership bid, swiftly followed by applications from Georgia and Moldova, has been warmly welcomed by central and eastern European countries, older members are wary of moving too quickly, with a country at war that has long struggled with deep-rooted corruption.  “This will not happen in the short term, because this is a whole process taking many years,” the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, agreed, saying: “It will take time.”  Acknowledging the divisions, a senior EU official said: “Part of the room wants to move swiftly, another part of the room of leaders wants to have some better distance and see, and have a proper discussion at a later stage whether Ukraine should join the union.”  Despite pressure from central and eastern European governments, the draft summit communique does not mention the EU’s membership application clause, treaty article 49.  Instead, EU leaders will invite the European Commission to submit an opinion on Ukraine’s application – the normal bureaucratic procedure – “pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership”, states a draft summit statement seen by the Guardian, with the recent addition: “Ukraine belongs to our European family.”  Separately, the UK announced on Thursday that it was adding seven Russian businessmen to its sanctions list, including the metals billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, described by the Foreign Office as “one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin”.  The British government is also imposing asset freezes on Putin ally Igor Sechin, the owner of Russian state oil company Rosneft, and Oleg Deripaska, an aluminium magnate believed by the Foreign Office to be worth £2bn.  Britain and the US are warning that Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine after Kremlin officials alleged without firm evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in the country. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, adding that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing.  “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted.  Meanwhile UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.

James Heappey said the Home Office was “reconsidering” current plans for vetting the more than 20,000 people who had fled Ukraine and were hoping to join family members in the UK.  After Labour accused the government of failing to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Tory MPs raised concerns about the UK lagging behind other European countries in its support for refugees, Heappey said some bureaucracy could be stripped away.  He said the Home Office believed it could reinforce the visa application centre in northern France without help from the Ministry of Defence (MoD). But Heappey said the MoD had been asked to “supply manpower to Poland, which is the busiest of the visa application centres by some margin” and that the department was “in the process of making that happen”.  It came as the PCS union, which represents civil servants including Home Office staff, has called for the government to take urgent action to help Ukrainian refugees after being told the “surge team” boasted about by Priti Patel amounted to just seven people.  The union understands the seven volunteers, who have been trained in personal safety, will assist with visa applications in Paris, Warsaw, Rzeszów, Chișinău, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague.  On Sunday, visiting the Ukrainian Social Club in Holland Park, London, Patel said everything was being done to process as many applications as possible. “I’m surging staff across all application centres across the entire European Union as well as in the border countries such as Poland, where I was the other day and obviously where huge numbers of people are coming through,” she said.  A Home Office spokesperson said the allegation from the union that there were only seven people in the surge team was “wrong”.  Heappey told Sky News: “We’ll supply as many people as they need in order to be able to get the highest number of people processed in the quickest time possible and then the home secretary has got some choices, which I know she’s considering, around how to further change the visa process and what checks might be necessary within it.”  Heappey said Patel would consider how to change the process and then “weigh that up against risk”. “A lot of people have made the point this is very different to Afghanistan, this is predominantly a refugee flow of women and children because fighting-age men have remained in Ukraine to fight,” he told BBC Breakfast.  “I know the home secretary is very aware of that but she needs to make decisions around how to change visa policy and, crucially, the security checks that are done within visa policy in a way that still gives her the assurance that she needs that at a time of acute competition in Europe between the west and Russia we’re not making the mistake of dropping our guard altogether.”  He added: “I know she’ll make the right decision.”  A warning that Russian forces were considering a chemical weapons attack was made public on Wednesday night in an effort to deter the Kremlin from following through with it, Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.  He said that while recent reports of civilians being killed were tragic, “they are but nothing by comparison to the suffering and devastation” that would be caused by a chemical weapons attack.  Heappey called it “the most despicable thing that everyone could imagine” and said he was “appalled it is even under consideration”.  After a hospital complex in Mariupol was bombed, Heappey said it was “utterly despicable” that Russia had either used its weapons indiscriminately against civilians or deliberately targeted the building.  “It is a war crime to not have due regard when you’re targeting for a protected site – like a hospital – when you’re using artillery,” he said.

Tui Russia was established in 2009 as a joint venture with Mordashov’s Severgroup to expand the business in Russia and Ukraine. Mordashov had invested in Tui and joined its supervisory board but he was forced to resign last week after the sanctions were revealed.  Tui had sold its stake in the joint venture at the end of March 2021 to KN-Holdings LLC, a company then wholly owned and controlled by Mordashov’s sons, Kirill and Nikita. However, Mordashov recently took back control of the company.  The brand licence agreement allowed Tui Russia to continue using the name in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It is thought that the Russian business is planning to announce a new brand name as soon as Thursday.  Fritz Joussen, the chief executive of Tui Group, said: “Tui condemns Russia’s attack and war against Ukraine. Our position is clear. The Tui brand must no longer be used by Tui Russia for its business and the company’s presence.”  Tui’s links with Mordashov have come under close scrutiny since the invasion of Ukraine, and Italian authorities last week reportedly seized a 65m yacht said to belong to him. Mordashov controls about a third of Tui’s shares via different investment vehicles.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br>  Mordashov’s shares in Tui have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell them to realise any profits. He also resigned from Tui’s board as soon as the sanctions were announced.  Mordashov, one of Russia’s richest men, owns Severgroup, which includes the vast Severstal steel producer and a Tui stake.  The EU’s announcement of sanctions on Mordashov said he was, through Severgroup’s banking, media and industrial interests, “responsible for supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”.  In a statement on Monday, Mordashov said he had “absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension” and did not understand why the EU had imposed sanctions on him.  Vladimir Lukin, another Russian with links to Severgroup, also resigned from Tui’s board this week.

The Chinese-owned video sharing app said on Sunday it had banned livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin criminalised the spreading of what it deems to be fake news about its invasion of Ukraine.  TikTok’s measures have extended to blocking all non-Russian content, meaning the only content Russian users can see is old videos uploaded by Russia-based accounts.  Russian access to internet content from inside and outside Russia has been severely reduced by the Ukraine invasion. Facebook and Twitter have had their services blocked by the Russian communications regulator after the platforms pulled content from state-media backed news providers across Europe. Twitter has launched a privacy-protected version of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship.  Tracking.exposed, an EU-based non-profit organisation that studies the profiling and tracking of internet users, described TikTok’s move as establishing a “splinternet” within a global social media platform. It said: “This is the first time that a global social media platform splits the content availability at such scale.”  According to tracking.exposed, which used Russian IP addresses to attempt to access non-Russian TikTok content, the accounts of the World Health Organization and the popular TikToker Charli D’Amelio – who has 137.6 million followers – are among those inaccessible in Russia.  On Sunday, TikTok said it did not want to put its Russian employees or users at risk of severe criminal penalties, as it described the service as a source of “relief and human connection during a time of war”. TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia.  The app is now applying labels to some state-controlled media accounts, including in Russia, with content on accounts for state-owned news providers such as Tass now carrying the label “Russia state-controlled media”.

Shown alongside images from before the invasion, the pictures paint a bleak picture of the damage done so far to the besieged city, which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy described as “ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening” in the wake of the shelling of a maternity hospital.  The city’s deputy mayor, Sergiy Orlov, told reporters of several civilian targets hit so far, including numerous residential houses, a children’s and maternity hospital, the main administration service building, and the city’s giant Avostal metallurgical factory.  Orlov said 1,160 people had been killed already, with 47 buried on Wednesday alone. About 200,000 people want to get out of the city, but with humanitarian corridors shelled, only around 2,000 to 3,000 are able to leave a day.  The first image, taken by private company Maxar, shows the extensive damage done to grocery stores and a shopping mall in the city, with both buildings smouldering under the intense shelling  Another photo reveals the damage done to residential areas, where many residents are without power, heat, water or communications for over a week. Some of the buildings have been entirely destroyed.  Another image shows swathes of residential houses destroyed, with neighbouring parkland appearing to be scorched. What appears to be an apartment block on the left edge is heavily damaged.  Another comparative image shows the damage done to malls and shopping centres, with the roof of the central building partially collapsed and the interior exposed.  The worst of the shelling has been coming in the city’s west, with the Red Cross describing conditions in the city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”.  In the call with journalists, Orlov called the siege “pure genocide”.  “They have used aviation, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, grads and other types of weapons we don’t even know about. This isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime and pure genocide,” he said.

He went for an 11-kilometer run through the streets of Kyiv.  Plyuyko has participated in 48 marathons in his lifetime. Before retiring, he worked as an engineer and served in the Soviet army. Today, Plyuyko is 75 years old and lives alone in what he describes as “a sleepy part of Kyiv”. Since war broke out, Plyuyko has maintained his schedule of daily outdoor runs, running around 150km in the past two weeks.  He laughs when I ask him if he’s scared of running outside. “During my run, I often hear more than 10 explosions which are within a 20km distance,” he says stoically. “What’s the point of worrying? I’ve lived most of my life anyway.”  ‘I want to show that we are a brave nation and that we aren’t afraid,’ says Plyuyko. Photograph: Nikolai Plyuyko  The only two days that he didn’t go for a run were when Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, asked everyone to stay at home. “I want to show that we are a brave nation and that we aren’t afraid,” he says. “We want to be strong, not just with our minds, but with our bodies too.” Plyuyko has been greeting every person he sees on his run, trying to lift people’s spirits. “I wish them good health, hope and trust in the fight with the enemy. I tell them that we will win, that we just need to get through it.”  As Russian forces continue to destroy Ukrainian cities, break ceasefire rules and kill civilians, Ukrainians are terrified. In Kyiv, most people stay at home or in shelters overnight and keep outdoor trips to a minimum. At the time of writing, the centre of Kyiv has experienced a slightly more stable period than the first few days of the war, when Russian airstrikes colored the city’s skyline. Still, sounds of heavy fighting reverberate around the city’s historic buildings. During the daytime, the atmosphere is suppressed but hopeful, with people going outside to the pharmacy, to get food in shops and markets or for a quick walk to move their bodies. Yet, against all odds, and potentially their own safety, a small group of older runners are still heading out every day in Kyiv, sometimes running as Russian bombs fall around them.  Plyuyko runs in Natalka, a manicured public park that runs alongside the River Dnieper. In the last few days, he has even started going for a cold-water dip in the freezing temperatures of the river’s lagoon during his run. “I want to train myself to control my thermoregulation and find energy in my body.”  The daily exercise has been helping him process the absurdity of an unexpected war on his doorstep. “I think about many things during the run,” he explains. “I think about everything I’ve lived through.”  In the past week or so, Plyuyko has not only been running laps, but he has been running errands and getting groceries for people less mobile than him in his apartment complex. “I’ve been getting in line at the shop for them and running it to their homes. This is a sign of friendship during these hard times.” Locals have been happy to see him too; they call him “Uncle Kolya” and wave at him or sing him praise each time he passes them.  I can’t go to fight at my age, there is an army for that, but it’s important for people to show that we are alive and strong  According to Plyuyko, most of the people who have stayed behind are either the “lonely elderly” or those who are choosing to protect their towns and other people’s lives. He is one of Kyiv’s residents who has decided to stay in Ukraine to see the war through to the end. Just across town is Volodimir Shymko, a 67-year-old who has also been running to fill the city’s empty streets. “So many people have left Kyiv. I can tell which of our neighbours have stayed behind judging by whether their lights are on, and there are very few people who have stayed,” he tells me solemnly over the phone.  Shymko, too, hopes that his running raises people’s morale. “I can’t go to fight at my age, there is an army for that, but we will see how the situation continues – maybe everyone will be forced to fight.”  Konstantin Bondarev, 61, is based in the south of the city with his wife and two other friends who have come to shelter in his house. He has been running long-distance since 1983. “Now that there has been war, I’ve been running non-stop; it makes things feel a lot easier during such turbulent times,” he tells me. Since 24 February, he has clocked 73km in running distance. “Right now, thoughts of war keep going round and round in my head; from the moment you wake up, you start ringing all your friends, asking if everyone is alive and well over the messaging app Viber. When there are always attacks, you wonder if anyone has been bombed.”  Seeing his friends’ maps on Strava is confirmation for Plyuyko that his friends are still alive. Photograph: Konstantin Bondarev  This, of course, has affected his nervous system, so the run has been helping him deal with the stress of the war. “When I run, I can put all that aside – at least for a moment.”  In Ukraine, men between the ages of 18-60 have been banned from leaving the country in case they have to fight in the war, even if they have no military experience. “It’s important for people to show that we are alive and strong. This is our expression of the fight.”  Shymko’s daughter and his grandson have fled to a part of the country that has now turned into a hotspot for Russian attacks. “They want to get out, but they can’t right now. I’m really worried about them; it’s a very grave situation.”  Shymko, who has run 40 marathons, says he will stop only if ‘someone was to shoot at me multiple times’. Photograph: Volodimir Shymko  Still, Shymko continues to run, in the past week, he has mustered 32km. The trained engineer, who is now a pensioner, has been a keen athlete since the 1970s. “I’ve run 40 marathons, and I’ve been in Berlin, Prague, Bratislava, Poland, Belgium, all around Ukraine.” And what would stop him? “Only if someone was to shoot at me multiple times,” he says macabrely.  The Guardian discovered Plyuyko and Shymko’s routes on Strava – a fitness-oriented social network that uses GPS data to track movement and allows users to share it publicly. The collected data is also used to create heatmaps, which shows trails left behind by the app’s users, so much so, Strava accidentally uncovered numerous unmapped military bases in 2018.  Calling the interviewees on Viber, the lines often went crackly, and Plyuyko, in particular, had trouble getting the app to work. “Can you hear me?” he would shout into the phone before hanging up multiple times. Eventually, we managed to set things up.  I spoke to everyone in Russian, as it was the only language we had in common, and I later translated the interviews to English. Listening back through the recordings, I could hear how much the men I spoke to really wanted to tell the stories of their lives and their runs. With a real possibility of Russian occupation, they were worried that their histories would be overwritten. When I asked for photos, they sent me dozens of images, some taken now and some taken when they are looking much younger. A horrible thought occurred; did they think this might be one of the last chances to be heard and to be seen by the rest of the world?  I have a friend in Kharkiv who hasn’t posted about running online for a little while – it’s worrying Nikolai Plyuyko  “It’s only natural to be scared when you’re running, and bombs are going off in the distance, going ‘boom’,” says Bondarev. “That does take the joy out of it.” On the day I spoke to him, he went on a run that started well but ended quite ominously. “When I ran out, nothing was going on initially, but then a military plane flew by and then by the end of my run, I saw smoke billowing out of something in the distance. I ran home and took a photo.”  He says he’s begun to feel a little paranoid, being wary of the people he sees in the street, especially if he can’t recognise them. “Now you can’t help but wonder: ‘Who is this? Where are they from?’”  However, his anxieties are temporarily assuaged when checking his Strava feed to see if his friends outside Kyiv are still running. This has become another source of confirmation that they are still there alive and well during turbulent times. “Strava has become an additional source of information for me – at this time, the data is the ultimate knowledge about someone’s wellbeing,” he says. Though internet connection and signal may be temperamental in Ukraine right now, knowing that his friends are still running is hugely affirming. “I will see that they have logged a workout and immediately I feel relief; though I do have a friend in Kharkiv who hasn’t posted about running online for a little while – it’s worrying.”  I ask Bondarev whether he thinks he will continue to run even if things get worse. “I feel like if someone doesn’t want to run, they will find any excuse, but if they do want to run, they will find a way. I think I will keep running. I’m not put off by adversity. I need to keep moving.”

About 400 people on four flights from Poland, Moldova and Romania landed in Tel Aviv on Sunday, among them 100 children who had been living in a Jewish orphanage in the northern city of Zhytomyr. Most of the new arrivals were visibly relieved to have reached safety; as is tradition, several people touched and kissed the ground after disembarking.  Many of the new arrivals had never been to Israel before, and did not imagine they would be making aliyah – the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Holy Land – under these circumstances. But as so often in the two weeks since Russia announced the military operation against its neighbour, history appears to be repeating itself.  “Israel is not what I expected … Well, I did not really know what to expect,” said 17-year-old computer programmer Yohor Sereda, who fled Kyiv with his father and grandfather. After a dangerous journey to the Polish border, for two days the trio took turns to stand in line and nap in the car before they were allowed to cross. In Warsaw, they were reunited with Sereda’s mother and two younger sisters, who had been on holiday in Egypt when the war broke out.  “I just took my laptop and a rucksack of clothes. It was very scary driving out of Kyiv: there were explosions everywhere. It felt like being in a movie,” he said. “But we are definitely the luckier ones.”  About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, but Ukraine and Russia are still home to large Jewish communities. Israeli interior minister Ayelet Shaked said on Tuesday that the state is preparing to take in up to 100,000 Jews from the two countries and other former soviet republics after the onset of Europe’s new war as part of Operation Israel Guarantees.  Up to 5,000 non-Jewish Ukrainians will be allowed to come to Israel and another 20,000 who arrived before the fighting will be able to stay temporarily. A heavily criticised policy of forcing Ukrainian nationals or their Israeli hosts to pay a 10,000 shekel (£2,330) bond on arrival at Ben Gurion airport has now been scrapped.  The country’s law of return – much reviled by Palestinians, to whom it does not apply – gives people born Jewish, converts, spouses of Jewish people and those with Jewish parents or grandparents the right to move to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship.  Since 1950, Israel has seen several waves of aliyah immigration from countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Yemen. Operation Israel Guarantees, however, is an emergency undertaking on a scale not seen since the influx of more than 1 million people after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.  At a four-star hotel next to West Jerusalem’s main bus station on Wednesday, the lobby and restaurant were chaotic: suitcases and bags of clothes were left next to sofas while Ukrainian olim, or migrants, spoke into their mobiles in Ukrainian and Russian to loved ones and lawyers sorting out their paperwork. Small children ran around playing while teenagers made TikTok videos.  Immigration ministry employees and volunteer interpreters were on hand to help. But for Igor Fedyaev, from the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia near the contested regions of Donbas and Crimea, the enormity of what has happened has not yet sunk in. While the state will help, he doesn’t yet know where his family will live, or learn Hebrew.  Igor Fedyaev, 43, and his son Maksim Fedyaev. The family embarked on a 680-mile car journey away from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum  Fedyaev was not following the news before 24 February, when the invasion began. As usual, he got up early for his weekly five-a-side football game before work, only to realise that something was wrong: the roads were empty, and the gym was closed.  “No one really believed it would happen. It was only the next day we realised we needed to look at escaping,” the 43-year-old father of two said.  Fedyaev thought about making aliyah in 2019 after visiting a friend in the Israeli city of Netanya, but forgot about it during the pandemic.  The family realised they would need permission from Fedyaev’s first wife in order to take his 16-year-old son, Maksim. While she was keen to help, no lawyers were available to assist with notarising the paperwork, and government databases had shut down. In the end, they had to leave with just a written note from Maksim’s mother before embarking on a 680-mile car journey, making lengthy detours to avoid bombed out towns and roads.  “The images we are seeing, it looks like the second world war,” he said. “In the end in every war you see the same sort of things. Most people love their home and the country they were born in. Just because [you are Jewish] it doesn’t mean you want to leave.”

Amore Vero, a yacht linked to the head of the state oil company Rosneft, once bore the name St Princess Olga, apparently in honour of Olga Rozhkova, his second wife.  After the couple split, around 2017, according to independent Russian media, the boat was renamed.  Sechin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin who has been described as the second most important person in Russia, never publicly claimed ownership of the Amore Vero. However, a reporter at Moscow-based Novaya Gazeta traced a series of pictures on Rozhkova’s Instagram that matched the 86-metre vessel and its movements through the world’s most glamorous ports. The boat accommodates up to 14 guests in eight staterooms, and has a private owner’s deck and a swimming pool that turns into a helipad.  Sechin was sanctioned by the EU on Monday, but he has not been blacklisted by the UK. Now the French government has confirmed it thinks he is the main shareholder of the offshore company that owned the Amore Vero. It was seized this week by customs in a night-time raid on a dockyard near Marseille.  The Amore Vero was seized this week by French customs. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters  The $120m (£90m) Amore Vero and others like it have become symbols of a crackdown on the super-wealthy elite around Putin after the invasion of Ukraine prompted a wave of sanctions as the US, EU and UK try to isolate Russia’s economy.  As chief executive of Rosneft, Sechin commands a central place in that economy. The oil it supplies to the world is one of Putin’s key geopolitical tools, and taxes on the company brought in 1.8tn roubles for the Russian government in 2020 alone. That cash would have been enough to fund about 40% of the annual military budget.  A Rosneft refinery in the Samara region of Russia. Photograph: Yegor Aleyev/TASS  Perhaps more than anyone else, Sechin is representative of the mixing of political and financial power that has characterised Russia since the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union. He has prospered under a regime that has seen huge private fortunes built from publicly owned assets.  “He is one of Vladimir Putin’s most trusted and closest advisers, as well as his personal friend,” the EU sanctions notice alleges. “He has been in contact with the Russian president on a daily basis.”  On the yacht, a Rosneft spokesperson said: “Mr Sechin is not aware of the presence of any company that owns this object.”  Sechin, 61, has revealed relatively little about his early life, but he studied French and Portuguese at Leningrad University in what is now St Petersburg. He then served in the army in Angola and Mozambique as a translator, according to Russian media. However, he is widely seen as a key member of Russia’s “siloviki”, the former members of the Russian security services who are thought to wield significant power in the country.  He has ridden on Putin’s coattails to Russia’s upper echelons. In the 1990s he worked in Putin’s office when the latter was first deputy mayor of St Petersburg, and in 1999 became deputy head of Putin’s first prime ministerial administration and soon afterwards deputy chief of staff in Putin’s presidency.  Igor Sechin, right, and Vladimir Putin visit the Konevsky monastery on Konevets Island on Lake Ladoga. Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/TASS  Sechin was first appointed to the Rosneft board in 2004, shortly before it absorbed the assets previously controlled by the billionaire owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky – now an exile after serving 10 years in prison following the dismantling of his company, Yukos.  After publication, Rosneft sent a long and rambling statement suggesting, wrongly, that the Guardian’s inquiries could have been “orchestrated by the former chief executive of Yukos Mikhail Khodorkovsky”.  “It is not possible for us to comment on the Guardian’s inquiry since it is fully based on false facts and outright lies, published by biased sources and tabloids,” the spokesperson wrote. “All these statements have been disproved in relevant court statements.”  While Sechin served a four-year term as deputy prime minister from 2008, it was his arguably his appointment as Rosneft chief in 2012 that marked his key position in Putin’s regime. Under his eye the company struck deals with Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Statoil (now Equinor), China’s CNPC and America’s ExxonMobil – then led by Rex Tillerson, later hired as US secretary of state by Donald Trump.  The EU claimed Sechin has been “rewarded” by Putin with “great wealth” to outdo even his Rosneft pay, reported at as much as $11.8m in 2015.

There is going to be a very high price for oil for a very long time, and even the prospect of physical shortages.”  Oil prices have leapt dramatically, to more than $130 a barrel, sending petrol prices in the UK to more than 155p a litre, while gas prices have also surged.  It’s shameful that oil and gas companies now seek to use this humanitarian crisis to further their interests. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift  Luke Sussams, of Jefferies investment bank, said: “The high-price environment is likely to last a long time. Boris Johnson has said that alongside the accelerated deployment of renewables will be greater production from the North Sea. There is the potential for growth prospects and upside [for fossil fuel producers].”  The EU, the UK and the US have all announced drastic restrictions on imports of oil and gas from Russia, which will affect the EU most as about 40% of EU gas comes from Russia, but will hurt all countries as prices are set internationally. Those governments are now urgently seeking ways to protect their energy security, through ramping up renewables and seeking alternative sources of oil and gas supply.  Opec, and Saudi Arabia in particular, are the obvious ports of call, but have been so far been reluctant to commit to increased production. This could change, as the FT reported that the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the US favoured an increase, news which sent oil prices down about 11% from their peak.  But the crisis gives western oil and gas companies such as BP, Shell, Exxon and Total leverage among governments. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson defended oil companies against calls for a windfall tax on Wednesday from Labour. He said: “The net result of that would be to simply see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas.”  Robin Baillie, partner in the energy group at the international law firm Crowell and Moring, said: “Governments around the world are looking for short-term solutions to finding an alternative to Russian energy, and the North Sea is an obvious one for the UK, until such time as more renewables come online.”  New oil and gas fields take years and even decades to come into production, so even if companies begin to expand their exploration immediately it will not reduce current prices. Big oil and gas companies are now awash with cash, which they could use to invest in pumping more from existing fields, and exploring new fields.  Green campaigners warned that oil and gas companies were using the Ukraine emergency to further their own interests, by encouraging governments to prioritise oil and gas production and make decisions now on investments that would have little impact on the current crisis but would vastly increase fossil fuel use for years to come.  Marc van Baal, of Follow This, a group of 8,000 green shareholders in oil and gas companies, said: “The leaders of oil and gas companies really have shown in the last years that they want to hold on to their old business model. This is what they understand – turning hydrocarbons into petro-dollars. So I am afraid this is what they are telling governments they should do.”  Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which campaigns to end North Sea fossil fuels, said: “It’s shameful that oil and gas companies, some of whom have profited from their Russian partnerships for years, now seek to use this humanitarian crisis to further their interests. The fact that they are still being listened to by governments, the UK’s included, is beyond belief.”  A stark reminder of the likely consequences of further dependence on oil and gas came from the International Energy Agency, which reported on Tuesday that greenhouse gas emissions had shown the highest ever annual increase in 2021. The global energy watchdog found that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, which make up the bulk of greenhouse gases, had risen by 6% in 2021 to 36.3bn tonnes, their highest-ever level, as the global economy rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic, relying heavily on coal to power the growth. The increase in global CO 2 emissions was more than 2bn tonnes, the largest in history in absolute terms, outweighing the decline in emissions seen during the lockdowns of 2020.  Renewable energy and energy efficiency offer alternatives to oil and gas, which the UK, the EU and the US are also pursuing. But if fossil fuel companies make decisions now to expand exploration and production, that will continue to result in high emissions for years and decades to come.  Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, a campaigning group in the US, said: “More drilling in more places isn’t a short-term fix, it’s a long-term problem that only makes oil and gas CEOs richer and locks us into more dependence on dirty, unreliable, expensive and volatile fossil fuels.”

Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv has made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. In an update on Thursday, the MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of the Ukraine resistance. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so.  Western officials warned of their “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In an assessment, they said an “utterly horrific” attack on the Ukrainian capital could be unleashed as Russian forces attempt to overcome the logistical issues that have apparently plagued troops headed towards Kyiv.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol “the ultimate evidence of genocide”. The children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city was destroyed by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainian officials said. Zelenskiy said children are buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation?” Zelenskiy added. The Guardian was unable to fully verify Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack.  Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials.  Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.” The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc’s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine’s request to join the EU.  Russia’s foreign ministry has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine, Britain said. The UK’s ministry of defence said the system uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects. Here is an explainer on thermobaric weapons.  The United States has seen indications that Russia is dropping “dumb bombs” – unguided munitions with no precise target – on Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. Officials added that the US was observing “increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties”.  Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians.  Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent concern. Still, the news is raising concerns that a lack of external power to the site could compromise nuclear safety.

Modi’s push, according to an Indian government statement, was that Putin should have a “direct conversation” with the Ukrainian prime minister, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in order to “greatly assist ongoing peace efforts”.  It was the latest signal from India that while it has refused publicly to condemn Russia’s violent and merciless actions in Ukraine, it might not approve of them.  Since Putin embarked on his invasion of Ukraine, much criticism has been directed at India for its refusal to openly repudiate Russia.  India has abstained in multiple UN security council votes against Russia’s actions, isolating it from the west, and in statements it has made vague references to the need for dialogue, diplomacy and respect for territorial integrity, without ever naming Russia directly.  To many, this is tacit approval for Putin from a country that has been an unwavering ally since before the cold war.  But for those familiar with India’s diplomatic history and traditions, the picture is far less black and white.  “India has never named names, as far as its allies are concerned,” said Avinash Paliwal, the deputy director of Soas’s South Asia Institute. “But India’s displeasure with Moscow is visible in how they are dealing with the Ukrainians, visible in the statements it is making at the UN, and visible in their repeated calls for a de-escalation of violence.”  Narendra Modi meets with Vladimir Putin in India in December. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty  Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has certainly put India – which considers both Russia and the US to be close and vital allies – in a difficult position, evident in the cautious diplomatic tightrope it has been walking the past few weeks.  There is, as Paliwal described it, a “historical hangover” in favour of Russia in India which dates back to the cold war and the USSR’s support for India in the bloody Bangladesh war in 1971.  The Indo-Russian relationship has continued to be nurtured by successive prime ministers (Modi and Putin met as recently as December) and, most crucially for India, Russia is its biggest supplier of weapons, with between 60% and 80% of India’s weapons and defence systems bought from Russia. India has also long seen Russia as a crucial counterbalance to an increasingly powerful China.  With India engaged in an ongoing tense military standoff with China along its Himalayan border, where a buildup of troops and weapons continues on both sides, and its relationship with its nuclear-armed neighbour and rival Pakistan remaining testy, India finds itself in no position to jeopardise the flow of defence equipment from Russia.  Within India, where sympathy for Russia is still prevalent both in the policymaking corridors of New Delhi and in the wider public consciousness, there is also little pressure for Modi to denounce Russia’s actions. As the conflict broke out, #IStandWithPutin gained significant traction on Indian social media.  Yet India has far from publicly taken Russia’s side and, as Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former permanent representative to the UN, pointed out, in its own subtle way, India’s statements around the invasion of Ukraine have increasingly diverged from Russia’s.  “Yes, India is abstaining when most of the world is voting against Russians, but in our mind, abstention is absolutely not support,” said Akbaruddin. “This whole action has left us in a space, not of our liking, not of our wanting, so why would we support it.”  Akbaruddin said there were “at least four or five” moments in recent weeks where India had increasingly distanced itself from the Russian position, including when they expressed “regret at the outbreak of hostilities”.  “Without mentioning Russia’s name, this is our way of condemning the actions of those responsible for the violence,” Akbaruddin said.  He also said India had, in an unusual move, outright denied statements made by Putin that Ukrainians had taken Indian students hostage, while also sending several planes of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  This week Modi made phone calls to both Putin and Zelenskiy, and made repeated calls for a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, India has not yet positioned itself as a mediator in the same vein as Israel or Turkey and has been accused by Ukrainian diplomats of not fully utilising its leverage with Russia to stand Putin down.  Activists protest in Kolkata, India, against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Photograph: Debarchan Chatterjee/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock  India’s other priority, pulling it in the opposite direction, is to protect its flourishing relationships with the US, Europe and the UK.  India’s non-defence trade with Russia is only $9bn (£6.8bn), compared with about $100bn with the US, and it has ongoing trade deal negotiations with the UK. Unlike China, Russia’s other significant ally, India has remained silent on the issue of Nato’s expansion.  Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that while India’s position on Russia’s invasion had thrown some “turbulence” into the US-India relationship, the White House has been understanding of India’s historical relationship with Russia and its security vulnerabilities vis-a-vis China, and so it was unlikely to disrupt diplomatic ties.  Most worrying for India, said Madan, was the increasing closeness between Russia and foe China, which could have an impact on the choices Moscow makes when its China and India security partnerships are in tension.  “The true ramifications for India are still being figured out,” said Madan. “But it’s likely there could be some tough decisions ahead.”

A children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol were destroyed by a Russian air strike this afternoon, Ukrainian officials said.  Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol, as fresh efforts to evacuate civilians from devastated cities along safe routes agreed with Moscow made little progress.  Ukrainian authorities said corridors should allow residents of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv, to leave.  Civilians did manage to leave Sumy for a second day, and some vulnerable people got out of Enerhodar in the north-west, but there was little evidence the corridors were working elsewhere.  Concern was rapidly growing over civilians in Mariupol in particular, where hundreds of thousands of residents have been sheltering from Russian shelling and missile attacks for more than a week without water, power or heating.  Britain’s Ministry of Defence said fighting continued north-west of Kyiv. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol were being heavily shelled and remained encircled by Russian forces.  Ukraine said the Chernobyl nuclear plant had been disconnected from the grid and reserve generators only had fuel for 48 hours. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern.

On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea.  On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer:  On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces.  On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack.  On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital.  On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it.  A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces.  On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe.  On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations.  On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed.  On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus.  On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol.  How did we get here?  Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine.  Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions.  The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded.  The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.  What do we know about Russia’s deployments?  Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.  An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion.  Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew.

Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters  These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year.  Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea.  The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February.  Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations.  How do the militaries compare?  Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland.  What is the historical context?  In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war.  A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement.  Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war.  What was the role of Nord Stream 2?  On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics.  First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.  Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.

It was more than a food experience. It was an exotic destination of devout pilgrimage. In 1992, I was living in St Petersburg for the summer to study Russian. I had travelled to Moscow on the overnight train with a group of Russian friends. The first thing I wanted to do – being in Moscow for the first time in my life – was to see Red Square as the sun came up. My friends had other ideas about the most important port of call. We had to go straight to McDonald’s and get a Beeg Mak or – just as exciting – a gamburger. (Actual Russian word.) There was no point in standing in their way. The Kremlin would have to wait.  This week, McDonald’s announced that it would be suspending its operations in Russia. This affects 847 branches and 62,000 employees, who will continue to be paid. The company’s president and CEO Chris Kempczinski said: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” The response echoes the actions of dozens of brands from Chanel and Burberry to Apple and Starbucks.  A Russian customer gets her first taste of McDonald’s in 1990. Photograph: Rudi Blaha/AP  Once upon a time three decades ago, the arrival of McDonald’s in Moscow represented the end of the cold war and the triumph of the joys of capitalism. On that first day in 1990, that first branch on Pushkinskaya Square expected to serve around 1,000 customers. But even before opening time, a line of 5,000 Russians was snaking round the block. As Russian customers explained to the western media covering the event, the queue was not a big deal. Queueing was something they were very used to. Customers marvelled at the size of the milkshakes. Some kept Big Mac boxes and other packaging to re-use at home because it was such a precious novelty. Others shook their heads at the outrageous prices. At 3 roubles and 75 kopecks, a Big Mac was the equivalent of half a day’s wages, costing the equivalent of $6.25 at the time – the most expensive McDonald’s in the world.  It is hard to overstate the frenzy around consumer experiences in the very early post-Soviet days. By the time that Mikhail Gorbachev left office in 1991, western brands such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Baskin-Robbins and Nesquik were becoming household names and were a source of curiosity, excitement and, sometimes, suspicion. (Gorbachev was later criticised for his appearance in a 1998 advert for Pizza Hut that was only shown in the United States.) This was at a time when western visitors would still be stopped in the street and asked if they wanted to trade their Levi’s. For a brief period in the early 90s, you would perhaps be the only foreigner Russians had ever met in person. When I went to live in Russia the year after my first visit, return trips home would be dominated by long shopping lists of things Russians wanted: washing powder, tights, makeup, always jeans. These things were starting to become available but they weren’t always good quality or easy to get hold of.  My Russian friends ate their way through the menu in reverential silence, picturing their bright consumerist future  As a foreigner, I was also regarded as a handy source of information about new brands being advertised on television. The nine-year-old sister of one of my friends would quiz me on this relentlessly. Was Bounty really the taste of paradise? What did that mean? Had I tried Uncle Ben’s rice? How was it different from other rice? Who was Uncle Ben? Was it true that he had been to Russia? It’s almost impossible, 30 years on, to imagine a world with next to no branding and devoid of consumerism. But in the late Soviet period people were used to state restaurants – which often had no food and no visitors – bearing the name “Restaurant” and shops identifying themselves by a giant logo denoting “Bread” or “Fish”. (And often selling items completely other than bread or fish, if indeed they had any items at all.)  Future Russian president Boris Yeltsin drops by for a shake. Photograph: Gennady Galperin/Reuters  In this climate, McDonald’s went early and went fast for maximum impact. The company had been in talks with Soviet officials about opening a branch since the mid-70s, so keen was it to get a foothold. But the innocence of the early 90s couldn’t last: Russians soon became demanding and discerning customers. Over the past two decades McDonald’s has had to compete with a growing array of homegrown Russian fast-food brands such as Kroshka Kartoshka (Little Potato), a baked potato emporium with more than 300 branches; Teremok, which also has 300 outlets and specialises in blini, borscht and pelmeni (dumplings); and Shokoladnitsa (Chocolate Girl), a coffee chain with more than 240 branches in the Moscow area alone. This level of competition has influenced the Russia-specific McDonald’s menu, which includes “country-style” potatoes (thick-cut wedges made with Russian potatoes), chicken wings, a non-alcoholic tarragon and mint mojito and the glamorous McShrimp – a Russian McDonald’s exclusive.  My own memory of that first Moscow outing makes me smile at the naivety of it all. On that momentous visit, I paid (obviously). My Russian friends ate their way through the menu in reverential, delighted silence, pausing only to sigh with contentment, picturing their bright consumerist future. Then one of them looked up and asked eagerly, “Can we get more ‘s soboy’?” What does that mean, ‘s soboy’?” I asked? It literally means “with oneself”. A long explanation ensued and I finally understood to my horrified astonishment what they meant – “to take away”. They wanted to buy as many items as possible to take home so that everyone they knew could try these delicacies. I tried to explain that this was not the point of McDonald’s. But my protests were in vain. And so, we travelled back 400 miles on an overnight train journey to St Petersburg, transporting the ultimate status symbol: a paper bag of cold gamburgery, soggy and festering in their luxe branded wrappers.

There, 193 nations reviewed a resolution on Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine” and voted overwhelmingly to approve it: 141 votes in favor, 35 abstentions and just five votes against. Even some of Russia’s closest allies on the continent – Serbia, for example, or Hungary – voted to condemn the invasion. “The message of the general assembly is loud and clear,” said the UN secretary-general, António Guterres.  What exactly is that message? In recent days, many commentators have pointed to a global map of the UN resolution to demonstrate the unity of the west and the world in taking on the Putin government. But to make sense of the geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion, we must look beyond the diplomatic theater of the general assembly to examine how these nations are actually engaged with the war in this phase of rapid escalation. And to do that, we should start with a very different map of the world – a map of global participation in the sanctions set against Russia by the United States and its allies.  The contrast between these maps could not be more striking. The US, the UK, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, the EU: beyond this fortified coalition, very few nations have chosen to take part in the economic warfare set against the Putin government. On the contrary, many of the world’s largest nations – including China, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Nato ally Turkey – have refused to join in. “We will not blindly follow the steps taken by another country,” said Indonesia’s foreign ministry representative at a recent press conference.  Latin America has been equally steadfast in its commitment to neutrality. “We do not consider that [this war] concerns us,” said the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all governments.” Argentina may have voted to condemn Russia’s actions at the UN, but its foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, was adamant about his country’s non-participation in the new sanctions push: “Argentina does not consider that they are a mechanism to generate peace and harmony, or generate a frank dialogue table that serves to save lives.”  The Latin American position has been echoed in Africa. “For five centuries, we have been pawns in the hands of the warring European states, bent on looting Africa of its human and natural sources,” says Pierre Sané, president of the Imagine Africa Institute and former secretary-general of Amnesty International. Sané tells me that the embassy in Ukraine has been recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast to fight in the war. “Should this war in Ukraine escalate, we say and we say it loud: do not bring it to our shores.”  Amid the Russian army’s brutal advance into Ukraine, a slew of letters, articles and Twitter commentary has addressed the “western left” for its apparent unwillingness to take on the Putin government. The invasion of Ukraine has been described as a “test” to root out the “pseudo-leftists” who fail to respond with force and conviction to support the west in its effort to isolate, undermine and eventually topple Putin in defense of the Ukrainian cause.  But the map of sanctions suggests that the true rift is not between left and right, nor even between east and west. On the contrary, the map reveals a rift between north and south, between the nations that we call developed and those we call developing. And by revealing this tectonic shift, the map can tell us something important about geopolitics in the coming age of multipolarity.  The rapid rise of China and the US reaction it has provoked have prompted many commentators to predict a coming cold war. Few expected Vladimir Putin to kick it off so suddenly. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes the former CIA director Robert Gates for the Washington Post. The immediate eviction of Russian representatives and Russian culture from the institutions of the west suggest the long slumber of the cold war may indeed be over: “Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world.”  The good news for Gates is that the Biden administration has already found its cold war footing. Its flagship Summit for Democracy strives to unite “the nations of the free world” – a remarkable homage to the era of anti-Soviet mobilization – while isolating autocracies like Russia and China. That is, with the usual exceptions: Saudi Arabia’s oil, for example, grants the nation a free pass to the “free world”, as made evident by the recent delegation dispatched by the Biden administration to secure the kingdom’s support to keep the oil flowing through the war effort in Ukraine.  In the age of unipolarity – in the long 30-year holiday that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union – the nations of the world were given a rather simple choice: side with the United States, or stand alone. Some nations sought to band together in collective acts of resistance to this hegemonic power. But the consequences were all but inevitable: invasions, coups and extensive sanctions to isolate their economies from the world at large.  As new powers generate new poles, however, the options available to US neighbor nations are no longer restricted to compliance and resistance. A third option emerges: neutrality. “Neutrality does not mean indifference,” says Pierre Sané. “Neutrality means continuously calling for the respect of international laws; neutrality means that our hearts still go to the victims of military invasions and arbitrary sanctions never imposed on Nato countries.”  Back in the first cold war, neutrality had a name: non-alignment. As the United States clashed with China and the Soviet Union in the skies above Korea, Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Broz Tito refused to take a side. “The people of Yugoslavia cannot accept the postulate that humanity today has only one choice – a choice between a domination of one or the other bloc,” Yugoslavia’s minister of foreign affairs, Edvard Kardelj, told the UN in 1950. “We believe that there exists another road.” The Non-Aligned Movement was born five years later, uniting more than 100 nations around the world around principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence.  Today, nations around the world are called again to take sides – between Russia and the west, and very soon between the west and China. But as the map of sanctions attests, the cross-pressure between these great powers may once again spark a movement for non-alignment, demanding a more universal application of international law against demands for unilateral exception.  There will no doubt be consequences for this neutral position. Non-aligned nations in the first cold war were frequently victim to aggression, invasion and economic embargo. The same risks to neutrality are visible today. Lithuania recently canceled a shipment of Covid vaccines to Bangladesh for its refusal to condemn Russia at the United Nations. The US, for its part, has already passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), giving license to punish countries with sanctions for trading with the other side.  But as great powers prepare for a new century of war, the call for non-alignment will only grow louder. Our task is to understand that call now as Tito and Nehru understood it then: not as “neutralism” or “passivity, as is sometimes alleged”. As they wrote in a joint declaration in 1954: “It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security.”

At time of writing, 13,789 protesters have been detained since 24 February. An observer scrolling Twitter or watching the detainee count ratchet up might think that the anti-war movement could threaten Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. But the reality on the ground looks different: the anti-war movement is small, weak and faces serious obstacles.  While the number of detentions is striking, it should not be confused with high turnout, because the detention rate is likely much higher than in normal conditions. Photos suggest that in many cities, the number of people at demonstrations is a few dozen or few hundred at most, with turnouts in Moscow and St Petersburg probably in the thousands.  When it comes to protest, size matters. A larger protest is generally safer to attend, as the individual risk of repression usually drops as the turnout climbs. But size is also essential to achieve visibility, which communicates a message to the public. Protests could play an important role in communicating opposition and even information about the war to the Russian public. But given the extraordinary increase in media censorship, the sudden eradication of independent media, the throttling of key social networking sites, and extensive use of propaganda, these protests are more visible to audiences in the west than to the Russian public at large.  The protests are also far too small to disrupt the status quo – another key measure of a protest’s effectiveness. An oft-cited statistic from Erica Chenoweth and Maria J Stephan suggests that non-violent movements are most likely to be successful when 3.5% of the population joins the protests. For Russia, that number is around 5 million people. Even if turnout in Moscow reaches the hundreds of thousands, there is little reason to believe that Putin, an isolated autocrat whose legacy now hangs on this war, will submit to their demands.  Why aren’t these protests larger?  Although many Russians are against the war, others are barely aware of it. Most Russians receive their news from state media, which is under strict instruction to refer to Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation”; using the terms war, attack or invasion is now a crime. Though it is difficult to estimate what share of Russians believe the state line, misinformation and propaganda are incredibly widespread.  The political opposition has been decimated in the last few years and is unable to coordinate an anti-war effort. Following the January 2021 protests in support of Alexey Navalny, his organisations were declared extremist and functionally eliminated. Other opposition political parties with national reach, such as Yabloko, are exceedingly unlikely to chance severe penalties for organising illegal protests, or expose their followers to repression.  For individual activists, the landscape is also bleak. Many oppositionists are in self-imposed exile, and lack both the social media reach and the moral authority to call for protest. Those in Russia are rapidly repressed, such as human rights activist Marina Litvinovich, who was arrested on the day of the invasion, a few hours after she posted about protesting. The repressive landscape is changing rapidly, with new consequences for speaking out introduced seemingly on a daily basis, and many potential protesters have already begun leaving the country.  As a result, there is no “anti-war movement” as such in Russia. The protests happening across the country have no coordinating body. Many have been planned through personal networks and social media posts. In some cases, opponents of the war have simply travelled to their nearest city centre in the hope of finding like-minded citizens. Many protests are single-person pickets.  Although the Russian anti-war movement is not currently looking likely to change the course of the war, that does not mean it will have no effect. Repression often leads to innovation in protest and new leaders and organisers may emerge. For instance, soldiers’ mothers, a group with a long history of political activism in Russia, may organise against the mistreatment of troops.  As the consequences of sanctions are felt across society, more Russians may oppose the war. Demonstrations against specific economic grievances such as wage arrears, inflation and declining pensions have been common under Putin. Yet Russians also exhibit a tendency to put their heads down when the economy sours, as they did during the economic downturn that followed the 2014 seizure of Crimea.  Even if anti-war protests remain small, they prove to the world that Putin does not represent the will of all Russians.

We must cut off this funding at source. This trade can and must be stopped through pressure brought by you, the consumer, on companies and governments.  Vladimir Putin sells 5m barrels of crude oil per day, a large share of which goes to Europe. Today, as EU leaders gather to discuss the crisis, we call on people everywhere to boycott Russian oil now.  We are receiving great support from many governments and people. They are taking in our refugees, they are sending us food and medicine, and they voted against Putin’s war at the United Nations. On Tuesday, the Biden administration agreed to ban all US imports of Russian oil and gas. But political leaders in Germany, Italy, the UK, and some other countries are afraid to impose an immediate embargo. They are afraid that oil prices will go up, and that their voters won’t understand why, or will be too angry to care.  You, the public, know better.  You are already on the streets and across social media expressing support for Ukraine. We appreciate all the videos sending the clear message that you are appalled by the horror Putin has brought. But your governments still fear that if they embargo Russian oil, you will hold it against them.  If there is a boycott of Russian oil, a plan can be put in place to address short-term supply issues. In the longer term, it is obviously now a national security imperative for all countries to speedily move away from their reliance on fossil fuels. What we are requesting will only accelerate the transition needed to address the climate crisis. Yet despite indiscriminate murder happening in Ukrainian streets and pledges of action from the most powerful world leaders at Cop26 in November, European governments still hesitate.  If we cannot end the age of fossil fuels in the face of civilian slaughter and the destruction of our planet, what will it take?  Let’s make it easy for them. We are organising a coalition to track the tankers that transport Russian oil and tell you where they are. The Russians will try to hide this information, but we will tell you where the ships are.  Last week, Shell bought a shipment of Russian oil, reportedly because it was available at a discount of just under $30 per barrel. The public backlash was immediate, and on 8 March, Shell pledged to no longer buy Russian oil. We need all oil companies to do the same.  These companies may not listen to the cries of Ukrainian children, but they will listen to you, their customers. Most oil is used for transportation, including for personal cars, lorries and planes. Please do not buy petrol or diesel from any company that is refining Russian oil. Do not fly on an airline that uses jet fuel made from Russian oil.  Demand of your leaders that no Russian oil is offloaded in your ports. Do not insure their cargo, do not lease ships to them and do not transport any oil or refined products inside your countries. Please do not conduct any personal or corporate financial transaction with Russian oil companies, their managers, or owners. This is all blood oil and blood money.  Any executive who makes the decision to buy blood oil or any products derived from blood oil will damage their brand and destroy shareholder value – anyone that incompetent should be fired immediately. We will make this point to boards of directors and shareholders everywhere.  We will also help bring lawsuits, on behalf of innocent Ukrainians who have suffered irreparable harm, against any individuals or companies that profit from blood oil. To the extent permissible by law in all relevant jurisdictions, on behalf of the dead, injured, displaced and traumatised, we will pursue immediate injunctions and maximum damages from all parties who now help Russia.  Putin thinks he is strong because Russia is the second-largest oil exporter in the world. But he is weak because he has put himself in your hands and you are angry because he is terrorising Ukrainian civilians and threatening the world.  We are standing up to Putin and we will win. Our soldiers are well-trained and millions of our citizens are taking up arms. There is no way for Putin to take over and control a country with more than 40 million angry people, all shouting, “Go home!”  But many Ukrainians, including thousands and thousands of children, are suffering every hour of every day. Unarmed civilians are being bombarded constantly. They hide underground. They do not have enough food or water. Many lack the medicines they need. More than 50 children have died in tragic circumstances. Thousands of lives hang in the balance.  The movement against blood diamonds changed the world, but it took years. Greed is very powerful. But we, the people, are more powerful and when we focus our anger, we can achieve anything and stop anyone.  We must end this war. You can help us. Tell your governments: not in my name. Boycott Russian oil now.

The Dassault Falcon 900 had flown about 75 miles from a New Orleans airport before turning back to the city, an unnamed source told the Reuters news agency.  The plane had been taking Trump back to his luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, from a New Orleans hotel where he addressed Republican party donors at a private event.  Other passengers included Secret Service agents, support staff and some advisers to Trump. The aircraft turned around just before 11pm.  The Politico website, which first reported the incident, cited a source as saying that audio of communications between the pilot and the air traffic control tower revealed that the landing was described as “emergency in nature”.  The plane belonged to a donor who loaned it to the former president for the evening, and Trump advisers secured another donor’s plane to take him back to Florida. He landed in Palm Beach at around 3am on Sunday.  At the event in New Orleans, Trump delivered a discursive and bizarre 84-minute speech, musing that US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia” as payback for the invasion of Ukraine.  “And then we say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch,” he told a laughing audience.  Trump also teased a presidential run in 2024, remarking: “We are looking at it very, very strongly. We have to do it. We have to do it.”  He is likely to be airborne again on Saturday when he holds a rally in Florence, South Carolina, along with Governor Henry McMaster and the congressional candidates Russell Fry and Katie Arrington.

The 44-year-old Novák has served as deputy chair of Orbán’s Fidesz and was family affairs minister in charge of his economic support agenda for the middle class, including subsidies for housing, state-backed home loans and tax cuts.  Analysts say Orbán, who faces a close election in less than four weeks, had sought to appeal to female voters in picking Novák for the largely ceremonial role of president for a five-year term.  Novák, who has backed Orbán’s condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will succeed János Áder, another Fidesz party stalwart, after winning 137 votes, based on a tally on parliament’s website. The opposition candidate Péter Róna received 51 votes.  Novák is congratulated by Viktor Orbán. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images  In a speech before the vote, Novák, a multilingual economist, said she would defend the constitution, drafted and approved by Fidesz, which has cemented key planks of Orbán’s conservative agenda.  In remarks published by the state news agency MTI, Novák said one of her first trips would be to the Polish capital, Warsaw, home to one of Orbán’s key European allies, the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS).  In power since 2010, Orbán has eliminated nearly all domestic checks on his power and has filled key posts with loyalists, which critics say could make it harder for the opposition to push through its agenda in case of an election victory.  In an interview with the news website index.hu in December, Novák rejected allegations that she would be an instrument used to extend Orbán’s power.  “Those saying that I would be just a puppet in this position degrade not me personally, but women in general. They cannot assume that a woman can be a sovereign public officer capable of making autonomous decisions,” Novak was quoted as saying.  Orbán has adopted an increasingly conservative political agenda to shore up his domestic support, including a crackdown on independent media and measures to curb the rights of LGBTQ+ people, which have led to clashes with the EU.

Public health advocates and researchers have feared since the coronavirus pandemic’s onset that PFAS, which are known to be immunotoxic, could hinder the body’s ability to fight Covid-19, and the four studies represent the first bit of research supporting the theory. However, the authors caution that more research is needed.  “There’s clear science and evidence that immunological response and PFAS are connected and associated – that’s why the Covid aspect is so important to pursue,” said Christel Nielsen, one of the study’s co-authors.  PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds most often used to make products water-, stain- and heat-resistant, and are called “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. They’re so effective that they’re used in thousands of applications across dozens of industries, but they’re also linked to cancer, decreased immunity, liver disease, kidney problems, birth defects and more.  PFAS are estimated to be in about 97% of Americans’ blood, and have been detected in all corners of the globe, including the Arctic. Some compounds can remain in the body for years or decades, depending on the quantity and chemical structure.  Pre-pandemic studies have strongly suggested that the chemicals reduce vaccine efficacy in children, and several studies of how high PFAS levels impact the Covid vaccines are under way.  The chemicals are probably immunotoxic because they interfere with the body’s ability to create cells that turn into plasma. Plasma generates the antibodies that fight infection, and PFAS compounds appear to impact “key molecules” in that process, said Phillipe Grandjean, an environmental health professor at Harvard.  A study he co-authored found one widely-used compound, PFBA, seemed to be particularly problematic. PFAS that are commonly used to repel water and grease in food packaging, or used as stain and waterproofing agents in clothing, shoes and carpeting can turn into PFBA when they break down.  The study’s authors checked plasma samples from 323 Danish residents who had Covid and looked for five PFAS compounds known to be immunotoxic. The study found detectable PFBA in plasma showed “a clear association with a more severe” symptoms and death.  “If you had PFBA in your blood, then you were more likely to go to the hospital, and to stay longer, to get into intensive care and to die from the infection,” said Grandjean. More than 20 of those people who had PFBA in their blood had died.  “The likelihood of this happening accidentally is extremely small,” Grandjean said.  Industry has said “short-chain” compounds like PFBA are safe because they don’t stay in the blood for as long as many other PFAS, but the study casts doubt on that claim. While many PFAS accumulate in the blood, PFBA accumulates in the lungs, and appears to exacerbate symptoms because of that trait. It did so even when it was found at lower levels than other compounds.  “The unique retention of PFBA in lung tissue may offer a clue to” why PFBA seems to cause more serious disease, the study stated.  PFAS exposure has also been linked to obesity and diabetes, the authors noted, which can intensify Covid symptoms. The chemicals have endocrine-disrupting properties that seem to mimic, block, or otherwise interfere with hormones that affect immunity.  Two studies looked at whether exposure to high levels of PFAS increased the risk of infection.  Researchers in Sweden checked infection rates from the pandemic’s first year in Ronneby, a town of about 30,000 where one-third of the population was for decades exposed to highly contaminated drinking water, and the entire population has elevated blood levels.  The infection rate was about 19% higher than in a nearby town with water that didn’t have elevated PFAS levels. The study also found that people with lower PFAS blood levels were more likely to be infected, though contamination is so great in Ronneby that lower levels there are still higher than the general population.  The authors characterized their analysis as a “fast and easy” way to look for a public health correlation and determine whether more investigation is needed: “This is something that clearly warrants further research,” said Nielsen, a study co-author, who added that they are undertaking a second more in-depth study and looking into the chemicals’ impact on vaccine efficacy.  Chinese researchers with similar aim checked urine and blood samples from 160 residents in the Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFAS. The study compared samples from 80 people who had either tested positive for Covid and 80 who had never been infected, and found “significantly higher risks of [Covid] infection in the subjects with increased urinary PFOS, PFOA,” two of the most toxic and widely used compounds.  An ecological study in Italy looked into morbidity rates among those exposed to high levels of the chemicals for 65 years in the Veneto region. An examination of a population of 200,000 found those exposed to high levels of PFAS had a 27% higher Covid mortality rate. The population was exposed to a mix of at least 12 compounds, which included PFBA.  The data “might plausibly suggest a general immunosuppressive effect of PFAS, it might be a quite specific effect of PFBA concentrating in the lungs and exacerbating Covid respiratory toxicity, or PFAS might lead to other conditions that predispose people with coronavirus infection to more severe disease”, the study’s authors wrote.  Co-author Annibale Bieggeri called the issue “an injustice”, adding that PFAS can also increase the likelihood of a variant because the virus will stay in bodies for longer.  He said the studies findings should prompt public health officials to make special considerations for areas highly affected by PFAS. Researchers say there’s little that someone who has been exposed to high levels of the chemicals, or has high levels in their blood, can do beyond the usual precautions.  “The most important recommendation that we can give is to get vaccinated, pure and simple, for everyone, and perhaps particularly in a highly exposed area,” said Swedish study co-author Anna Joud.

The FTSE 100 company reported record profits during 2021, thanks in part to a gas price surge in the final three months of the year amid a rebound in demand for commodities as the global economy recovered from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.  Van Beurden’s pay rise, to €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021 from €5.8m (£4.9m) the year before, came amid widespread calls, including from the Labour party, for booming energy companies to pay a windfall tax on profits as people in Britain and beyond struggle with a cost-of-living crisis.  Average weekly earnings for British people rose by 4.3% in the year to December, meaning their real wages fell because of inflation, caused in part by higher energy prices.  Van Beurden was paid 57 times more than the median Shell worker in 2021, according to the company’s annual report.  Luke Hildyard, a director of the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, said: “Shell’s chief executive rakes in millions and half their UK employees make well over £100,000. Oil and gas companies have argued that money for a windfall tax would have to come from their budget earmarked for long-term investments. But when they are paying out such huge sums to wealthy investors and top earning staff that argument looks laughably weak.  “Businesses that truly want to serve society should be happy to contribute a slightly higher rate of tax at a time when they are having a bonanza year, through pure good luck rather than their own hard work or innovation, while society as a whole is struggling with rising costs, stagnating wages and further economic turmoil.”  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused energy prices to rise further since the start of the year, suggesting that even higher bills may be likely for households and businesses.  Van Beurden was forced to withdraw Shell from its joint ventures with Kremlin-controlled oil firm Gazprom worth a total of $3bn, including drilling projects at the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, projects in Salym and Gydan, both in western Siberia, and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has been cancelled since the invasion.  Shell announced this week it would stop buying Russian oil or gas, and would close its 500 petrol stations in the country. The petrol stations closures have prompted a $400m writedown on assets.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Van Beurden said last week: “Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction.” However, in his foreword to the annual report he described the exit as “in line with government guidance”, referring to the heavy pressure thought to be exerted by the UK government as it sought to isolate Russia’s economy.  The company awarded Van Beurden €5.4m in bonuses and long-term incentive payments, on top of his €2m fixed pay. He also received a “motoring allowance” of €14,400 and money to pay for transport between his home and the office of €2,494.  He will also be paid moving costs and a housing allowance for two years after relocating from the Netherlands to London at the company’s request.  Shell paused Van Beurden’s annual bonus during the first year of the pandemic. Before that he received €10m in 2019 and €20m in 2018, a record if excluding 2014 when pension calculations inflated his reported salary.

Twenty years on, 6 Music is the biggest digital station in the UK, with 2.6 million listeners. It survived a serious threat of closure in 2010. Its audience has grown up with it (breakfast show host Lauren Laverne even DJed at the wedding of a couple who met discussing the station). The presence of independent acts that it championed such as Dry Cleaning and Yard Act in the UK album chart – and Little Simz winning a Brit award – reflects its impact.  Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.  But a lot has changed in 20 years. 6 Music positions itself as “beyond the mainstream” – but indie and alternative music have become central to British culture: while 1.5 million people applied to attend Wimbledon this year, 2.5 million tried for Glastonbury tickets. The independent music scene has become markedly more diverse, and music fandom is no longer the sole preserve of the young. Taylor Swift collaborates with the National now. Is 6 Music too cosy to reflect these shifts? And how does it handle change when – as they discovered when DJ Shaun Keaveny left last September – many of its listeners would quite like things to remain exactly the same?  That tension speaks to its place in its loyal listeners’ lives. 6 Music became a lifeline for many during the pandemic, and its role will surely continue, licence fee cuts not withstanding. I spoke to Laverne on the morning Russia invaded Ukraine. “Days like today are a challenge because people wake up feeling anxious, sad, overwhelmed,” she said. “They need us to be a soft place to land.”  In the beginning …  Chris Hawkins, presenter I was part of planning the station. It was about filling a gap somewhere between Radio 1 and Radio 2 – there was a market for music lovers who weren’t being catered for by those stations.  Steve Lamacq. Photograph: BBC/Leigh Keily  Steve Lamacq, presenter The Radio 1 Evening Session was ending in 2003 and I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. Then 6 Music got in touch. I was excited that somebody wanted to put us on air because my morale was quite low. Here was somebody saying: “Do you want to do three hours of radio, old records, new records, and basically get on with it?” It was incredibly liberating.  Hawkins At first it didn’t really feel like a proper radio station. We had one on-air studio, one production studio and a kitchenette. In the early days, you could hear the photocopier whirring. I always remember John Peel wandering around the same corridors and that had a certain magic about it.  Lamacq John Sugar, who ran the station, would always say: “Dig deeper.” That was the catchphrase. Don’t just play Love Will Tear Us Apart.  Gilles Peterson, presenter At first I thought 6 was like old-school Radio 1 at night, very indie – with massive admiration for all those broadcasters, I’m just from another space. I thought the audience would think of me as a bit dancey – “Oof, jazz, not sure about that”. But it was a natural platform for me to be able to do what I do best.  Lamacq On Sunday we had a weekly phone call with Richard Hawley called “Hawley’s hangover cures”, then he would choose some completely obscure rockabilly record.  Shaun Keaveny, former presenter There was a period when it was very comedy-focused – Russell Howard, Jon Richardson, Russell Brand and Adam and Joe – and I think they drifted too far towards that for a little while.  Lamacq When Lauren Laverne joined about 18 months before the threat of closure, that’s when we really worked out what we were doing. We were far more accessible. The danger was that in the early days, it was like you weren’t allowed in unless you knew the catalogue numbers of the first 10 releases on Stiff Records.  Hawkins And then, of course, came that sort of D-day.  The threat of closure in 2010  Matt Everitt, presenter It’s not a big station in terms of headcount. Why close us when we do something really distinct?  Lamacq It was lucky we’d worked out what it was before someone tried to close us down, because when people listened in to see what it was, they found it quite enjoyable.  Tom Ravenscroft, presenter Weirdly it was the best it had ever sounded. Maybe there was an element of: let’s not give a fuck. There’s more of a punk attitude than perhaps there is when you get really popular. I felt like, if the ship was sinking, I wanted to be on it. I thought even if I could get a show on there for six months, I’d be happy.  Everitt David Bowie was making statements, but there were also tens of thousands of people telling the powers that be: no, this is a mistake. And it survived.  Keaveny It was a Lazarus story. And it was beautiful and the start of a huge love-in over many years.  Ravenscroft: As things get more popular, they get less risky – “now this thing’s really popular, we don’t want to break that”. So I think naturally, things became a little less punk rock.  Alternative to what?  Everitt At the start, the public perception was: it’s kind of indie. That wasn’t really true at the start, but over time that inclusivity has become more apparent.  Gilles Peterson. Photograph: BBC  Samantha Moy, 6 Music head I want this station to be as representative of all music lovers as possible. We still play indie and alternative, that is part of our USP, but so is Sherelle and Little Simz.  Lauren Laverne, presenter The breakfast show is traditionally described as the shop window of the station. When I started doing it I was keen that all the genres that have a place on 6 were represented in the show. I wanted to open the doors.  Peterson I approach my show quite differently to all the other shows, in that I don’t have a script. I won’t even pick the first songs until seconds before the show starts sometimes. It’s a very volatile show, a bit like free jazz.  Lamacq: I still get tons of actual post – vinyl and CDs, which I really delight in. If somebody has sent you a 7-inch single, you know how committed they are to their project.  Lauren Brennan, music team editor Deciding what goes on the playlist is an enormous balancing act. We’re looking at the strength of the track, what we think will interest the audience, but also the playlist as a whole to make sure there’s a diversity of voices – that we’re representing as many genres as we can.  Matthew Maxey, radio plugger 6 feels like a genuine meritocracy in that metrics like social media following, music video views have little to no influence on what gets played. An artist with a relatively small profile on a DIY label will be heavily supported and even playlisted if the song’s good enough.  Simon Hallyday, 4AD 6 is a really important factor in how we set up a release in the UK. We speak to them early on and roughly tell them our plan and see if the timing works with their playlist. We will juggle [release] times so it’s convenient for the band and the station. They’re that important.  Brennan A lot of it is gut instinct. When Wet Leg’s Chaise Longue was sent to us, we put that on the playlist straight away – it had barely any time on air to build but everybody in the team knew we had to play this now.  Lamacq: If your record doesn’t go on and somebody else’s record does go on, it all boils down to: my band’s better than your band. It’s not malicious and it’s not overly competitive. But you feel the need to wave the flag. and if they take notice of somebody else’s flag this week, then next week, you’re going to come back with an even bigger flag.  Jeff Bell, Partisan Records The success of Idles and Fontaines DC – and the fact that every other week now there is an artist in that [post-punk] vein appearing at the top end of the [album] charts – just goes to show how the work that someone like Steve has done has permeated wider music culture in the UK.  James Smith, Yard Act 6 has managed to revive interest in new indie guitar music again by rebranding it as post-punk. Although us and our contemporaries may be bound by certain traits – semi-spoken lyrics and angular sounds – for the most part the bands coming through do sound completely different from each other.  Scott Devendorf, the National 6 Music has been incredibly important for us – we grew up together over the past 20 years.  Martin Mills, Beggars Group Does it affect what we sign? Exposure on 6 is a factor in what we can achieve – but the majors shape records to get on the radio. We make the records the artists want to make.  Lamacq On average, just by email, I get 200 singles a week. And there are a lot of very generic records. You could get annoyed by it. But you can’t stop because something amazing will eventually come along. I listened to that Wet Leg single 19 times the day I got it. That’s what a teenager does.  Laverne I think I was the first person to have Lizzo in session in this country, then you see her at Glastonbury or Little Simz at the Brit awards. It’s not like I would overstate it – they’re the artists, it’s all their own work – but to be able to share their music is so exciting.  Peterson I’m discovering music from around the world but fitting that into the context of clubbing and electronic music. That taste has become more normalised now, so in a way my job is done.  Moy John Peel’s spirit goes the whole way through 6. John played the cornerstones of 6 Music – Bowie, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey. But he was progressive, always looking out for the next thing. In his later years, it was White Stripes, DJ Scotch Egg, grime. I think you see that coming through with our presenters, and it felt like it showed how future-facing he was and how that spirit is still alive in pop culture. That’s one of my proudest commissions.  Ravenscroft Everyone always makes this comparison between 6 Music and my dad, which I don’t personally see.  Camilla Pia, assistant commissioner We did a Bowie season five years after his passing. I thought, how can we tell a story about Bowie that hasn’t been told a million times? We had a real range of voices on there, Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens.  Simon Hallyday: 6 Music is so broad now that it’s harder for the artists who made the station to get back in there. That competition is a good thing. It’s part of how sustainable and flexible you can be.  Lamacq When I started going to gigs in London at the end of the 80s, if you saw someone even over the age of 30, it was: “What are you doing here, Grandad?!” It’s not like that now. We’ve gone through a 20-year period where more and more people over 30, 40, 50 haven’t given up on music. That’s been part of our success story – it shows that we understand our audience, we’ve grown up together.  Laverne I’m the daughter of a sociologist, so I find these social shifts fascinating. The generation gap between my dad and his parents was massive. Between me and my dad, it was much smaller. My 14-year-old has just cleared out my record collection of J Dilla, MF Doom and Wu-Tang, so it’s very small between us. Music’s not about age, it’s about attitude.  Keaveny How much more growth is sustainable? Originally it was providing something that the big stations weren’t. How much bigger can you get before you’re just another one of the big ones?  Jeff Smith, head of music When I joined in 2007, we had 500,000 listeners. We’ve got 2.6 million now. A lot of them have grown up with us – I don’t think we’ve lost an awful lot and I don’t think we’ve compromised.  6 Music’s changing faces  Lamacq I’ve been in the same spot since 2005. A member of management once said I was the Ken Bruce of 6 Music: solid, reliable, gets good figures, gets on with it; without Popmaster, but with new bands.  Afrodeutsche. Photograph: BBC/Sarah Louise Bennett  Ravenscroft I was given the opportunity to learn on the job through nepotism, ultimately. I joined [in 2010] and then no one else joined for like, eight years. I was also the youngest DJ. It was kind of ridiculous.  Laverne There was a time when I was the only woman on weekdays. It didn’t feel right. If you’re a public service broadcaster, it’s our job to reflect our audience. I was really pleased to see that change.  Moy I wanted to get more music into the daytime. When I’m looking at any 6 presenter, I want to make sure that they have real authenticity. Shaun might not have been at the super sharp end of it but he put together a brilliant radio show that was absolute companionship. I wanted to try something different with him.  Keaveny It was a small offering. Perhaps a weekend show, a couple of hours a week or something.  Moy Ultimately it was his decision to leave.  Keaveny They tried to persuade me to stay. I considered it for a while but I thought the brave thing to do was to step away.  Keaveny: I would say this on air – I always felt like the dickhead at 6: the clown, the generalist rather than the specialist. I was the friendly guy giving out leaflets at the door. I was trying to entice people in and then they get hit over the head with serious music. I always thought it was possible to have both. It was possible because we did for a long time.  Everitt I worked with Shaun for a long time. I love him dearly and I loved working on that show. The way we covered Bowie’s death [which Keaveny and Everitt announced live on air] has been talked about a fair amount – it’s one of the things I’m most proud of.  Keaveny I had a little chat with Johnny Marr, because I know that he’d been through a lot – you leave a band like the Smiths then join about 75 other bands. He sent me a massive message that said: “Change is good. Don’t worry about it, don’t fear it.” What did I do after my last link? We went to [legendary Camden venue] the Dublin Castle and got unbelievably pissed, which is the only right way for a 6 Music presenter to leave the stage, really.  Moy What was really important to me was having an authentic club culture show. 6 Music has been on air for a very long time and if you’re 45-plus, there’s a big chance you went clubbing. Having a show that can talk about Frankie Knuckles and go right through to Sophie’s legacy, helmed by the Blessed Madonna – that should absolutely be on 6 Music. And it was a question of when with Jamz Supernova.  Afrodeutsche, presenter I was approached with the concept of the show and within a month Sam was welcoming me to the BBC. If I’d taken a breath I probably would have said no, because I didn’t know what I was embarking on. All I knew was I love music, and here’s an opportunity to share all the different types of music that I love: yes.  Peterson There was an imbalance in terms of the background of a lot of the broadcasters and I think that they’ve certainly addressed that.  Laverne It’s important for 6 to develop new talent and I’m such a big fan of the new people coming through. I want people who are going to give me a run for my money. This morning I was driving into work and Deb Grant on early breakfast was playing Virginia Astley, and I was like, wow, OK, here we go!  Lamacq I don’t think I’ll still be there in my 70s. I have to go and see bands live, and I might be a bit knackered by then. Maybe there’ll be a day where I wake up and want to wear slippers and listen to trad jazz and that’ll be the end. But at the moment, particularly having had 18 months where we haven’t been able to do the job properly, trying to make sense of what we’ve got now is a challenge I’m enjoying. While I feel excited like that, I’ll carry on until they tell me to stop.  Ravenscroft Where do 6 DJs go next? The gap between stations is really weird. For some presenters, the longer you’re at 6, the harder it is to go anywhere else.  Afrodeutsche I didn’t realise until I started this show that my music knowledge is pretty deep. I thought I just loved music. It turns out I’m a massive nerd for detail, dates, how sonics change because of technology. I’d never claimed that before 6 made me see it.  How to broadcast in a pandemic  Laverne The pandemic was a big lesson in responding to how our audience was feeling and a huge illustration of things we instinctively knew about the importance of radio for mental health and wellbeing, the community aspect of what we do.  This morning I had a lady on her way to a shift at Alder Hey children’s hospital saying thanks for cheering her up Lauren Laverne  Lamacq My wife’s a psychologist. She said: “Don’t keep referencing it, don’t say things like ‘We’re all in it together’. Be positive and don’t keep coming back to how terrible it is.”  Afrodeutsche Listening to radio was really important for me because I live alone. It was like I had someone with me.  Peterson I think I was the only show on the weekends that was going out live. I felt like I was needed, so I wanted to make sure I was on top form. I got into the habit of getting up and going for a big run, and that gave me the energy to get to the end of the show.  Lamacq This time last year was the worst – cold, dark and wet. Just me and the producer on the other side of the glass. No one else on the floor at all. You had to go in early to do a temperature check but you couldn’t go into your studio until 15 minutes before you were on air, so there were 45 minutes where you were wandering the streets. That wasn’t the greatest, sitting outside Domino’s with a can of Coke and a packet of crisps. I’d occasionally treat myself to a cider.  James Smith What’s happened with Yard Act over the last few years wouldn’t have happened without Steve Lamacq and 6 Music. It was people’s only access to us, because the live show didn’t exist, and we didn’t exist before lockdown.  Laverne I fell into my job through having fun and doing TV jobs for shoe money back in the day. In my early 20s I thought, I want to do something meaningful with my life. And I find that side of what I do incredibly meaningful – this morning I had a lady on her way to a shift at Alder Hey children’s hospital saying thanks for cheering her up. That’s the other thing you’ve got to remember when there’s a big global event happening – people still have the challenges of their everyday lives, which can be really significant. I don’t want to overstate it because it’s also about having fun and just enjoying what you do. But it means a lot that we can make her morning a little bit nicer.  Here’s to the next 20 years  Keaveny The BBC sometimes doesn’t understand how great it is at certain things. If you’re making live radio fit a non-live platform, you’re fucking up the live show. There aren’t enough people vocally championing the virtues of live radio without the bells and whistles.  It’s taken four months to not feel sick with nerves before doing the show, but I get it now. It’s just so much joy Afrodeutsche  Lamacq There have been so many threats to linear radio over the last 20 years, like how people have been saying guitar music is dead since the days of the Haçienda. We will see as new generations come through whether they want radio in the same way. As long as radio never forgets how brilliant it is at being immediate and spontaneous, I think it will still exist.  Moy It would be premature for me to speculate on the implications of any licence fee settlement.  Lamacq The BBC, sometimes to its detriment, can move quite slowly. But in this case, I think the period of thought and reflection and consideration is probably the right thing. No one’s pushing alarm buttons.  Moy What does the move to Manchester mean for 6? [By 2027, 60% of 6 Music production will come from Salford, a rise of 20% from current figures.] You want to represent all parts of the nation, because we’re paid for by the licence fee. What I’ve talked about in terms of [music] representation – it’s the same for the UK. It’s gonna be a real opportunity. Will there be big lineup changes? It’ll be a brilliant opportunity to think about what 6 will sound like, what voices it’ll have on it. When you think about what 6 sounds like now, Afrodeutsche’s based in Salford, Marc Riley, Craig Charles – they sound fantastic. So I’m not concerned.  Peterson I really hope that the government get – and I think they do – the cultural imprint that music has. You wonder what Britain is about sometimes. Music is still really relevant and resonant.  Laverne Every morning we wake up and there’s three hours of silence that we get to fill with whatever we like.  Peterson I walk in there with my records on my back and I have this excited joy that I had when I was 16 going to my first pirate radio shows.  Afrodeutsche We’re in Salford. We’re going live in 27 minutes. I’m shaking, taking deep breaths, wide eyes, looking at my producers and going: “It’s OK!” but not really knowing if it is – and then just going for it. Every Friday, as soon as we go live, we take the feed from London and there’s no going back. It’s like doing live gigs. It’s taken four months to not feel sick with nerves before doing the show, but I get it now. It’s just so much joy.  The BBC Radio 6 music festival will take place in Cardiff from 1 to 3 April with highlights broadcast on 6 Music and BBC Sounds. Shaun Keaveny presents the podcast Creative Cul‑de‑Sac and the online radio show Community Garden Radio.

Sometimes, it’s the forms I have to fill out, other times it’s the harsh lighting – but the thing I hate most is the television, which is often harnessed in a corner near the ceiling. It is meant to be a distraction, but it never manages to take my mind off why I’m in the clinic in the first place.  Early one morning in May 2021, I was sitting in a health facility in central Berlin. It was different from the aseptic ones I had visited when I lived in New York City: this was higher-end, with mild luminescent lighting and a floral smell wafting throughout. In the far corner of the waiting room, a TV was showing a family of penguins in Antarctica waddling along an icy shore. I was unconvinced by its message of optimism, of nature triumphing against the odds.  On the walls of the waiting room, there were posters of young couples in bloom, tethered to each other, smiling intently, some of the women with protruding bellies. Most of these expressions read like success. I tried to internalise these positive messages, playing Eye of the Tiger in my mind to summon victory. But it was hard to manifest the strength of Rocky ascending the stairs in triumph while I was hungry, thirsty and clad in a burgundy hospital gown, Crocs and a green hairnet.  For two weeks, I had injected hormones into my abdomen daily and sprayed more into my nostrils. These were meant to increase the size of my eggs and offset ovulation. All I could tell was that they induced a state of listlessness broken only by extreme hot flushes. While my body was being optimised for egg extraction, my partner waited with me in the clinic. I looked like a patient ready to go under the knife. He was primed to jerk off in another room to a selection of adult entertainment that included Girls Gone Wild and Latinx Holiday.  Afterwards, I sat with my partner, tense and despondent, waiting to hear what had happened. The doctor came in and said: “We were only able to extract two eggs.”  Two eggs. Two. This was the lowest number yet.  “We will try to fertilise the two eggs with your partner’s sperm, and I am hopeful that it will be effective,” she continued.  In previous extractions, I produced four or five eggs per cycle. This was our fifth attempt at IVF, and the fertilisation rate had so far been 50%. Two days later, the physician telephoned with painful news – none of the eggs had been fertilised. Anguish rushed into my soul, bringing the dismal conviction that I would remain childless.  We had gone through this process five times, and five times it had failed. Each time, our misfortune went unexplained. We had both been tested for genetic preconditions. A haematologist processed my blood; I had surgery to remove a uterine fibroid. My partner had varicocele surgery – to remedy enlarged veins in the scrotum – in October 2020 in the hope that it would improve his sperm quality. It did not.  The process of in vitro fertilisation is brutal, not only because of the mood swings brought on by hormone injections, but also because of the weight gain. One of the many things I have absorbed from everyday sexism is to hate my body, and I was acutely self-conscious about my belly – I had a baby bump without a baby.  In a way, I felt anti-feminist for wanting to be pregnant at a moment when more radical forms of kinship are being imagined. For several years, one friend of mine has been co-parenting a child with two of her romantic partners, moving beyond the cultural norm of one mother to three.  For many Black women I have come to know – ambitious, progressive, and independent – motherhood is a matter of choice. Some of my Black female friends have embraced their role as auntie, stepping into the position of jaunty elder who inspires their nieces and nephews to be adventurous. This nurturing role is fulfilled on their own terms, allowing them the freedom to pursue their life’s work – professional ambitions, financial security or travel. “I don’t want to make somebody else,” states the rebellious seductress Sula in Toni Morrison’s novel. “I want to make myself.”  Before I tried to get pregnant, I never thought it would be a challenge, or that it would raise questions about my body and identity. I had previously felt ambivalent about parenting. Like Sula, I activated my power to be whole, Black, and free. With a community of Black women, I travelled to Paris for the Afropunk festival, organised late-night dance parties in Berlin, and swam in coral reefs off the coast of Tanzania. Being Black and free has been at the core of my existence, given that my mother and her mother were often restricted from living their lives on their own terms. It is not just about flight – it is about pursuing my desire to be a historian and writer, and anchoring myself in affirming friendships and a relationship with a loving partner. But like many people, I was pulled in by my parents’ desire for grandchildren. After I turned 30, my Haitian mother would call and spontaneously declare: “I am ready for grandchildren.” Like the steadfast millennial I was, I would change the subject and hang up.  As a Black American living in Germany in 2021, I was already finding this period of my life difficult. I was exploring my identity in a new place while a global reckoning for Black lives raged. I was surrounded and assailed by images of Black Americans in distress. Reading about the death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville or the eviction of a Black and indigenous family in Portland, I found myself wondering whether I should bring a Black life into this world. As my partner and I underwent each IVF cycle, I believed my answer was yes – mostly because he was the only person I could imagine being a parent with.  As cliched as it sounds, we met in a Marxist reading group in Berlin. On the surface, we could not be more different. I am petite and curvy, while he is tall and lean. Beyond the separate, inherited identities of class and nationality, we found common ground in politics and psychoanalysis. Amid uncertainty and grief during the pandemic, we took the leap to live together – something neither of us had done with any previous partner. His wit and ability to charm me with his British humour has been a relief to my radical-left feminist cynicism. Together, we supported each other during our transition from somewhat secure postdoctoral fellows to the more precarious venture of becoming writers. Even translating our different versions of English – he says coriander, I say cilantro – brings a smile to my face.  A woman at a protest in Sydney in June 2020 after the killing of George Floyd in the US. Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP  In the US, where anti-Black violence was a trademark of society, the decision to have a Black child forced me to reflect on the reality that a child of mine might come with foretold grief. In Germany, it felt safer to contemplate bringing up a child, far from armed civilians or trigger-happy police. But more importantly, because of my partner’s compassion and sincerity, I could finally imagine being a parent.  We discussed having children with lightness, imagining what parenting would be like together. I thought we could raise a rabble-rousing socialist family. He would joke that we should call our child Toussaint, after the Haitian revolutionary. I offered that we could choose from an array of Black radicals, including Harriet Tubman or Assata Shakur. We teased each other about the surname. I suggested X – after Malcolm – in order to not pass on the name that enslavers had given my ancestors. At the same time, I felt reluctant to conceive in a world, and a country, where I felt so out of place.  While this was going on, I often thought about the Black women in my family who had little control over their reproductive lives. I had always imagined that once I decided to bear children, it would be easy. My maternal grandmother had 13 children and my mother had three. I assumed I would be part of the first generation – to my knowledge – to have full agency over my reproduction. But what I didn’t realise was that assisted reproductive technology does not guarantee conception. It was an invasive, emotional experience that caused me 15 months of despair.  I was raised by working-class Haitians who migrated to Miami. For my entire childhood, I lived in a majority-Black working-class neighbourhood where the bungalows and apartment blocks were painted fervent pink and bright amber, and whose accessories could pummel your eyes – Catholic figurines carved into lawns, Christmas lights hanging from ramshackle porches all year round. Palm trees soared up between derelict building, providing some relief from Miami’s oppressive heat.  We found a way to breathe life into the community through street parties that stretched out well past midnight, even amid the stench of abandoned waste. The neighbourhood characters – from adolescent to senescent – were full of voracious spirit and wry humour, while the children would rebel against any adults who tried to curtail our freedom to play.  Nothing says “love” the way Black women do the tender work of child-rearing. At one time, we had nine people living in our two-bedroom duplex. In addition to our immediate family of five, we had a rotation of relatives – the recently divorced aunt, the uncle (literally) fresh off the boat, a cousin who became a surrogate older sister. My mother raised her niece in our home for several years during my childhood, and did everything to treat her like a daughter, to the point of regularly dressing us in matching outfits.

Our house, a miniature Haitian Ellis Island, was home for whoever my parents could help. When the state fails them, Black people try to provide one another the care they need. Another cousin became a de facto guardian to her nephew, after her brother was incarcerated during the early months of his child’s life. We have never adhered strictly to being a nuclear family. Instead, we carved out a robust and tender support system for one another. Whenever I had a dispute with my parents, or “ran away”, my aunt would console me, feed me, provide relief for my adolescent rage.  At 18, I was accepted into a private liberal arts college on the US west coast. Suddenly finding myself among a mostly white middle-class student body, I was made aware of the contradictions of enlightenment. This was a place that espoused “atheism, communism, and free love” – the college’s unofficial motto – while mainly welcoming in a privileged few, along with some low-income students, like myself, who were admitted with scholarships and student loans.  For a time I thought about becoming a doctor, and volunteered at a clinic. It was a progressive organisation in Portland, Oregon, that provided free medical care to intravenous drug users, sex workers and the unhoused. During my weekly night shifts, people trickled in, hammered by their latest fix or seeking shelter from the perpetual rain. One forthright patient, thinking I was a doctor, pulled down his pants to show me the abscess on his buttocks. One young woman, a heroin user, was several months pregnant and living under a bridge with her boyfriend. These people were barely hanging on. Theirs was a different face of poverty from the one I grew up seeing: they were all white. At the same time, their life stories were similar to those I saw in Miami, except that what existed in the crevices of the Pacific Northwest was an even colder, lonelier version of destitution.  There, I saw how resolving medical problems was not just a matter of physical checkups or taking vitamins. We had to think bigger. The patients needed safe housing and non-judgmental medical care, and not to be criminalised for drug use or sex work. The clinic showed me how the essential work of healing was tied to the project of mutual aid. We need to challenge the systems that make us sick. I came to see medicine as being not just about healing, but also about imagining different possibilities of living in the world, of stepping outside the pathologies that have been imposed on working-class people like myself, and making us whole, through reparations, restitution and redistribution of resources.  Some people think of children in binary terms: to have them or not to have them. When lockdown began in March 2020, my partner and I decided to take our chances and started trying to conceive. Being in our 30s and healthy, we assumed we would be parents in no time. After several months, I realised it wasn’t going to be so easy. Like clockwork, I bled every month – each menstruation greeted with mounting disappointment. A problem that had emerged long before I moved to Germany, but did not really sink in until I was engulfed with pain and failure, seemed to be making my body an unhealthy place for an embryo.  In 2015, while I was a doctoral student at Princeton, tests revealed that my uterus was damaged. The official diagnoses were endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The endometriosis, I was told, was a mass of lesions that, untreated, might contribute to infertility, while the fibroids – non-cancerous tumours whose causes are unknown, and which are three times more prevalent among Black Americans than white – could also cause infertility. The tumours were steadily growing inside me, flourishing and creating a home where they shouldn’t have been. If they hadn’t caused pain, I probably would have kept them – mostly because the surgery would have interrupted my research, and I didn’t then have anyone to take care of me afterwards. I had one round of surgery in 2015 and another in April 2021.  Whenever my emotions are anaemic, I pry open a book, hoping to find refuge in someone else’s prose. Whether it was my academic undertaking to trace the fragility of life during a plague, or my journalistic assignment to track instances of racism in medicine, I was gnawed by the details, hoping that I exist outside the statistical categories of being Black in the US. I had hoped that relocating to Germany offered a new possibility for what a healthier life could be like.  My surgical experiences in the US and Germany were wildly different. In general, the care I received in the US was compassionate, but came at a high cost, financially and personally. My 2015 fibroid surgery in the US cost $90,000, while the 2021 one in Germany cost €0. In Germany, the public medical system felt fairer and more humane, even if German doctors had a more hard-nosed style. Thinking she was doing me a “favour” by not raising my hopes, one German physician told me that, being in my mid-30s, I was too old to have children. The health workers I encountered were at best methodical, and at worst brusque, but there were no barriers to getting healthcare.  Many predicted the Covid-19 pandemic would herald a baby boom, given all the spare time people suddenly had. What could one do but shag? However compelling the idea, it didn’t work out like that – at least not in the US. For about six years, the birthrate there has been decreasing, and in 2020 it declined by 4%. This is likely due to the expense of raising children, the lack of state support or paid parental leave. In contrast, Germany saw a 10% increase in its birthrate in 2020, the highest since 1998, most likely related to longstanding government support for reproductive assistance and paid leave.  Having my IVF partially funded by the German medical system felt revolutionary. Even as a foreigner, I benefited from a welfare programme that is not available to most working-class women, including many of my relatives, in the US or Haiti. For the first time I felt as if I had the power to break through the constraints that had shaped my life in the US.  Race is not the only lens through which we can see how people are treated, but it does often determine whether someone has access to healthcare, if their pain is considered “legitimate” and, in the context of Covid, whether they are more likely to die. Today, maternal mortality is soaring in African-American communities. Medical racism takes different forms in different places, with subtle vocabularies, at times echoing violent histories. While these histories can seem abstract, the trauma is embedded within us, and expresses itself in the people we become.  Black motherhood has historically been precarious in the US. Under slavery, women had no control over whether they had babies, or were allowed to raise them. As historian Leah Wright Rigueur has written, Black mothers were vilified, generating “the American mythology surrounding the so-called menace of the pathological Black matriarch of the 1960s, the treacherous welfare queen of the 1970s, and the drug-addled crack mother (and her babies) of the 1980s”.  This unexamined trope has become part of the accepted canon of racism in the US. There is little public support or sympathy for Black families, but that does not prevent Black mothers from seeing themselves in another light.  There are people who have had families that give them support and comfort and a model for what love might be. At present, that is not my reality. We are often told that, in order to get a sense of ourselves, our humanity and our worth, we must become parents. And for those of us carrying intergenerational trauma – enslavement, genocide, forced migration – the pressure to “carry on the family line” complicates what family obligation means. For women from Black, working-class families like mine, to have children – countering the forces that tried to destroy us – can be a powerful political act.  I say all this not to be fatalistic, or even to reduce the cherished and beautiful moments of Black kinship, but to highlight that the historical discrimination against Black women has combined with these discriminatory narratives about them to strip away our humanity. My aunts speak about parenting in vague terms, about how they value it, not for some intrinsic reason, but as something that their parents and grandparents did. Never do they say what I think about motherhood: they do not speak about the material difficulties and psychological struggles. Instead, their dreams are deferred to my generation, who they hope might avoid the hardships they endured. Being a parent is one of the most underappreciated jobs in our society. Of course, we should demand wages for housework and provide more space and support for people who do this. As I struggled to get pregnant, I was aware that so many of my life circumstances have been shaped by who deems me worthy of care.  As it became clear that my fertility journey was going to be rugged, I started reading heavily on the subject, taking refuge in research papers, books and leaflets about reproductive hormones. Writing became part of how I dealt with my pain, but it barely deflected my shame or anxiety. I regretted waiting “too long” to think about starting a family, and I was ashamed of my jealousy at seeing others successfully do so. From June 2020 until August 2021, I suffered from a depression that affected my work and my ability to connect with others. It turns out that my post-IVF depression was not uncommon. Infertility damages mental health in many ways, and the clinical depression and anxiety disorders that occur after failed IVF attempts can have long term negative consequences.  With my friends, and the feminists I organised with in Berlin, I looked for ways to bring up my experience. I needed compassion, but sometimes I received only unwelcome advice: drink tea, try acupuncture, just relax. Some people offered unwanted counsel: “Why don’t you adopt?” or “You can’t get pregnant because you’re too stressed.” Such comments made me petulant. Everyone seemed to have a friend who had tried for two months and magically got pregnant. It felt like some people I knew could simply cough and conceive. Meanwhile, I had to accept that some people will never get pregnant, no matter how hard they try.  During one low point, after my final IVF attempt had failed, I read an article about a white British woman in her 30s with early-onset menopause who managed to conceive. I began to see a pattern in the way that fertility struggles get told. There is a growing body of literature that focuses on the infertility struggles of highly educated white women who succeed in getting pregnant. These are celebrated because the majority of readers can relate to them. These stories seem to imply that, with determination, a person can conceive, that childlessness can be conquered with tenacity. People want to read happy stories, and accounts of difficult pregnancies that end in birth are, of course, uplifting. It is more challenging to tell a story about fertility treatment that ends in childlessness.  With few exceptions, I felt invisible in these narratives. But then I came across Emily Bernard’s book Black is the Body, in which she describes her own reproductive struggles, and how she felt like a failure for not being able to conceive. Her account stuck with me and festered like an open sore, as I considered how conception stood for so much more than bodily failure. Like me, Bernard was an ambitious Black American scholar and writer, and like me, no matter how much she tried, she could not conceive (she ended up adopting). Emotionally exhausted by the ebb and flow of artificial hormones, and the isolation I felt in the midst of the storm, I was further marooned by my inability to develop a precise language, or a method of coping.  Infertility stung me. I sought insights from family and friends. I revived a group chat with my cousins and asked how many of them had fibroids. I connected with Black parents I knew in Germany, and heard their stories of conception, pregnancy and birth, each different from the next. One friend and confidante, who struggled for nearly 10 years to conceive, told me how she had been ready to adopt right before she became pregnant. These conversations were healing, but they have not been enough.  My inability to have a baby opened new vistas of disappointment and grief. It has forced me to meditate about my soul’s purpose, to accept and move on, to imagine new possibilities for myself, and forge new bonds. At the same time, I have to rationalise that my body, like all bodies, is complex, and there is no simple answer for why I cannot get pregnant.  My fertility struggle has shown me that I need new ways to envision parenting outside giving birth. Wright Rigueur shows that Black parenting can be full of laughter and pride, not just the fruit of suffering, but an experience shared by people with common political aims, desires and agency. Her account of Black mothers’ joys reminded me of what I was missing. The stories she recounted, of new life coming to this Earth, revealed Black love, visceral and beautiful, and in a way, validated my pain and how I felt embattled and charred. I want to feel that joy of Black motherhood, the hope that runs through a lineage of survivors.  It’s hard to say that I will never be pregnant. I do not know if I will ever feel comfortable with my body with the exactitude that Black joy demands. Black joy is grounded in the active commitment to love myself and accept that I am complete. But there are days where I don’t feel that way. I want to hold dear to the words of the poet Robin Coste Lewis, who affirmed without apology in an interview that “black joy is my primary aesthetic, often: the world was so muted in what it offered us, but because of love and family and connection, our lives were gorgeous.”  Knowing that I cannot get pregnant is forcing me to look inwards, to find ways to mourn, and to recognise that joy has to come from elsewhere. My partner and I have walked in the forests of Brandenburg, done Sunday yoga and watched trashy TV. And though these rituals have been healing, they have not been enough. In Revolutionary Mothering, the poet Alexis Pauline Gumbs suggests an alternative: “Queer, utopian, and hopeful and critical articulations of mothering” centred on collective kinship.  I find that Black joy enshrined in my friendships with queer Black people, the people who create havens of safety where we can debate the big questions and share the trivial – whether watching HBO’s Insecure or passionately debating which west-African country makes the best jollof rice. But there is also comfort in our listless moments, those periods of walking aimlessly in the summer heat and finding a shoulder to lean on. This is the family I have chosen to create.  In our confessional culture, it is not uncommon to reveal intimate aspects of being human, our identity, our sense of self. But we mostly tell the stories that appear digestible – our brilliant accomplishments, only occasionally sharing the less uplifting subjects. In the closing lines of a story such as this, one might assume the denouement brings a child: it doesn’t. Unfortunately, it ends here.

Usually, these articles make scant reference to the surrogates’ wellbeing, instead being written up as breathless tales of derring-do, as plucky couples launch daring raids to bring their babies to safety.  The Irish Independent, for example, reported on a County Kerry couple who had brought their son back from Ukraine without making any reference to their surrogate, presumably left postpartum in a war zone. Sometimes, the couples appear indifferent to the plight of the women left behind: one American parent recently wrote a 1,257-word Instagram post about getting her newborn out of Ukraine in which she thanked her gym for keeping her “fit enough” to make the journey and the travel agent who had arranged her hotel, but did not make any reference to the woman who had carried her baby.  Olga Danchenko, a surrogacy lawyer from Kyiv who fled to western Ukraine with her family on the first day of the invasion, has been inundated with emails and phone calls. In their worry for their babies, many of her clients forget her own predicament. “The parents who are facing problems getting their babies don’t care about us,” she says. “They say: ‘Hi, Olga, give me the documents.’ ‘Hi, Olga, please draft this.’ ‘Hi, Olga, I need a birth certificate, I need my baby, I signed a contract with you.’ Not a single question about how I am doing.” She sounds exhausted. “We have nightmares during the day and during our dreams at night,” Danchenko says. “Can you imagine? Everything is broken in one day.”  ‘The parents don’t care about us’ … Olga Danchenko, a surrogacy lawyer. Photograph: Courtesy of Olga Danchenko  Not everyone is focused solely on the babies. “I want to look after our surrogate,” says Annabel (not her real name), a teacher in her 40s from Suffolk. “Not just because she is carrying our baby – but because she is a human being I have formed a connection with.” Annabel and her husband have been trying for a baby for a decade. In that time, they have endured four miscarriages and the death of a prematurely born daughter. Annabel researched surrogacy carefully and picked an agency she felt was ethical. “We didn’t go into this to abuse or take advantage of anyone,” says Annabel. “We entered into an agreement with a person to change our lives – and financially we can change hers.” She considers her surrogate, a 33-year-old mother-of-one who is 12 weeks pregnant, a friend. “We made a connection straight away,” Annabel says. “It’s hard to explain what that feels like, when you meet someone who will change your life.”  Even before the war, Yana Belozor, who is 32 and lives in Kyiv, had seen how badly some surrogates are treated. A former surrogate herself, she says the agency she used to work for gave her no emotional support and that she had to chase her salary (most surrogates are paid a lump sum and then a monthly stipend). When she gave birth in 2019, she says the agency sent her to the worst hospital in Kyiv. “I still have nightmares about it,” she shudders. “I was treated like an animal. All the surrogates were placed away from the women having their own biological children and treated differently.”  Commercial surrogacy is outlawed in most of the world, although it is legal in some jurisdictions including certain US states. The Ukrainian ombudsman for children has said he believes it should also be banned in Ukraine, where an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 children are born via surrogacy each year. The human rights group La Strada receives 100 calls a year from distressed Ukrainian surrogates. “They send us their contracts so we can assess how legal they are,” says Yuliia Anosova, a lawyer for the organisation who is currently a refugee in Poland. “They’re a total disaster. Often, they’re not even legal.” She recalls one contract in which a woman was forced to relocate mid-pregnancy and told her salary would be docked if she refused.  But advocates for Ukrainian surrogacy argue that the overwhelming majority of agencies behave ethically. Before the war, says Danchenko, the system was “amazing” and acted in the “best interests of children and parents”.  One surrogate got in touch to say that her agency was trying to make her get an abortion  Belozor became a surrogacy coordinator for another agency, Delivering Dreams, to make sure other women had a better experience than she had. “This is my calling,” she says. Before the war, she was responsible for the wellbeing of 14 pregnant surrogates, mostly in Kyiv. By law, clients – or intended parents, as they are known – must be married, heterosexual and medically unable to have children.  These couples, and their surrogates, are caught up in the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. “Things have got insanely hard,” says Sam Everingham, an Australian fertility lawyer. He has a roster of 70 clients with Ukrainian surrogates at various stages of pregnancy. Natalie Gamble, a British fertility lawyer, is helping 23 British couples, with surrogates ranging from eight to 39 weeks pregnant, get across the border. “In every case, parents are worried about whether surrogates will be able to access medical care and give birth safely, and what will happen if the couples can’t get there when they do,” she says. “Will the babies be left in a war zone with no one to look after them?”  Compounding the chaos is the fact that few agencies expected Russia to invade, meaning that they did not make contingency plans. “The situation in Ukraine is stable,” one agency reassured clients on Facebook in late January. “There is no increased or unusual military activity.”  ‘The world needs to help’ ... surrogacy coordinator Yana Belozor with her daughter.  Belozor’s American boss, Susan Kersch-Kibler, felt differently. In the second week of February, Kersch-Kibler persuaded 13 of her 14 surrogates, and Belozor, to move to Lviv in western Ukraine. None wanted to go. “They were arguing with me,” Kersch-Kibler says. “It was hard. In the end, I had to sell it like a paid holiday.” Kersch-Kibler offered to move the surrogates’ families with them, but only two of the surrogates, and Belozor, brought their children. They thought they would be going home soon and didn’t want to uproot their families.  For now, these surrogates, at least, are safe. But, under Ukrainian martial law, male citizens aged between 18 and 60 are not permitted to leave the country. Surrogates may soon face a terrible dilemma: evacuate and leave their partners and even children behind, or remain in a country under attack. To compound their worry, their family and friends back home are not safe. Belozor’s husband is a firefighter in Kyiv. “For 11 days, he hasn’t been able to change his clothes or take a shower,” she says. “All day long, he is inhaling smoke.”  Despite her worries, Belozor keeps working. “My biggest job is to keep the women all emotionally stable,” she says. If they start to feel anxious, she takes them to a doctor, to confirm the baby is OK. The day before we speak, Belozor’s best friend from childhood, Alexi Semenyk, was shot in the head by Russian forces near Luhansk. He was 35. Like many Ukrainians, Belozor is desperate for western countries to implement a no-fly zone over the country. “The world needs to help,” she says, sobbing. “There won’t be any peace in this world, because Putin is so sick and unpredictable and dangerous.”  Annabel’s surrogate and her son are now safe in Poland. The journey took three days. “She told us when she got on the train, but then her battery died,” says Annabel. “I was literally sick with fear for her and her son. You’re watching the news to see if there have been any attacks on trains, or at the border. When I got her message to say she’d crossed the border, I cried.”  Annabel hopes that her surrogate will be able to join her in the UK – if that is what she wants. “We want her here so we can look after her,” Annabel says. “And not just until the baby is born. We want to look after her until she can go home, or wherever she chooses for home to be. If she chooses to stay here, then we will help establish her here.” Annabel and her husband will drive to Poland to collect their surrogate and her son, if they can get them emergency travel documents and she is willing.  However, there are no legal routes for surrogates and their families to resettle in the UK. Ukrainians are allowed entry only if they have family members already resident. (A mooted “humanitarian route” has become mired in confusion.) By contrast, Ireland has removed entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees. “This is a small group of women who are carrying British children,” says Gamble. “The UK has a responsibility to protect them.” Gamble wrote to the home secretary recently, asking her to make provision for surrogates who are pregnant with British children, and their families, to come to the UK. The Home Office has not responded.  I’m helping surrogates to deliver safely and fighting in the territorial defence. My Kalashnikov stands beside me as I type  Relatively speaking, Annabel is lucky. Some non-Ukrainian couples have lost contact with their surrogates. “I’m totally heartbroken and losing it,” writes one on a Facebook group. “The agency … is not responding to my emails … I do not have direct contact with the surrogate so I’m unable to reach her. Not sure if she’s OK. Would like to do anything I can to help her and her daughter.”  Fabiana Marcela Quaini, an Argentinian lawyer, knows of one client who has lost contact with their surrogate, who is due to give birth next week. Kersch-Kibler and her team are assisting surrogates and parents contracted to other agencies. “We’re trying to help anyone in this situation,” she says. “The parents are desperate to contact the surrogates. One surrogate got in touch to say that her agency was trying to make her get an abortion and she couldn’t get in contact with the intended parents.”  Kersch-Kibler understands the parents’ despair. All of the couples using Ukrainian surrogates have tried for years to have families. “This is their last chance,” she says. “For them, that child is precious beyond all words. It’s hard for them to cope with the pictures on TV, knowing their child is in the same country.” Some clients are catastrophising. “I only sleep a few hours a night,” says Jorge, a 48-year-old lawyer from Buenos Aires. He was in a WhatsApp chat with 60 people in the same situation, but left the group. “The group was making me really crazy,” he says. “I can’t avoid watching the news, but the group was too much.”  Ukraine is one of the few countries in Europe to allow commercial surrogacy. Photograph: Sally Anscombe/Getty Images  Jorge and his wife tried unsuccessfully to have a baby for a decade. Their surrogate, Katerina, is four months pregnant. She is in Kyiv with her husband and sons and is unable to find a safe route out of the city. “I can’t imagine how a pregnant woman can live in a war with explosions,” says Jorge. “For this reason, I’d prefer for her to come to Argentina, but I can’t decide for her. She’s free. She’s not a slave.”  Because Katerina doesn’t speak Spanish and Jorge doesn’t speak Ukrainian, they usually communicate via the agency, but Jorge is trying not to hassle staff there. “I don’t want to disturb them by calling all the time,” he says. “They’re in a war and I have respect. I know the men at the agency have to take up guns to defend their country.”  Dmytro Pugach, a 48-year-old fertility lawyer from Kyiv who is coordinating the evacuation of dozens of surrogates, is one of these men. “I have to combine work for life and work for death,” he emails. “I’m helping pregnant surrogates to deliver safely, and fighting in the territorial defence. My Kalashnikov stands beside me as I type this.”  This is a small group of women who are carrying British children. The UK has a responsibility to protect them  Surrogates are being allowed to exit Ukraine with minimal documentation. But this exodus has significant legal ramifications. Under Ukrainian law, intended parents are automatically viewed as the legal parents of children born via surrogacy, but this does not apply in the UK, Ireland or much of Europe. “Some embassies are friendly to surrogacy, but in Austria and Germany surrogacy is not permitted,” says Danchenko. “Parents and surrogates need documents that it’s impossible to provide, as administrative offices are closed.”  Parents don’t understand why they can’t fly their babies home without documents. “They are aggressive,” says Danchenko. “They cry. They say: ‘Give me my baby.’ I ask about their documents and they don’t care. I’m a lawyer. What am I supposed to do without documents? That is human trafficking.”  Of course, not everyone can leave. One of Pugach’s surrogates is in a town that has been blockaded by Russian forces. She is trapped. Should she need medical attention, her options may be limited. Hospitals and clinics have been attacked. A maternity hospital in the city of Zhytomyr was bombed on 1 March; a Kyiv maternity hospital was hit the day after. On 9 March, a maternity and children’s ward at a hospital in Mariupol was reportedly destroyed by a Russian air strike. At the time of publication, fatalities were not confirmed, but unverified reports indicated that children were buried under the rubble.  It is a terrible situation for all involved – and unlikely to be resolved soon. “I pray for the health of Katerina, her sons and her family,” says Jorge. He can’t stop thinking about the last time he saw her, in Kyiv. She was walking to a tram stop, holding a box of chocolates. “I will always remember that image,” Jorge says. “Kyiv was beautiful and peaceful. Now, on the news, I can’t believe what I see.”

People like me hold up fashion to be a kind of divining rod for the coming public mood, so I think it is best to admit that I called that one spectacularly wrong.  Just hours after Milan fashion week began, Russia invaded Ukraine. Coco Chanel once said that “fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening”. Great when the world is emerging from a pandemic and life is looking exciting again, and fashion can nurture feelings of hope and optimism by selling delicious new frocks as if they were chicken soup for the soul. Not so great once war breaks out. Military tailoring? I’ll pass, thanks. But it’s fair to say party dresses haven’t been flying off the shelves, either. Which made for a strange mood at fashion week. Tricky to pitch next season’s wardrobe as a fun thing to think about when the immediate future is quite so frightening.  After a slow start, the fashion industry has shown up for Ukraine. From Chanel and Hermès to Zara and H&M, most brands have shuttered stores and paused online operations in Russia. LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, has pledged €5m (£4.2m) to the International Committee of the Red Cross, while Kering, which owns Gucci and Alexander McQueen, pledged an undisclosed “significant” donation to the United Nations Refugee Agency.  The tone of Paris fashion week was, for the most part, sober and businesslike. Many of the collections were already scheduled to be shown in small presentations, because a catwalk show requires months of planning and only deep-pocketed luxury brands were in a position to take that kind of financial risk back in January, when the world was still spooked by Omicron. Paul Smith handed out cups of tea and cheese sandwiches as he explained how the new half-moon shaped shoulder pads he has developed for women’s tailoring offer a wearable take on the dramatic oversized tailoring that was all over the Milan catwalks. “It’s about respecting the female form,” he said. Having spent 16 weeks of 2020 working entirely alone in an office that usually houses hundreds – “just trying to keep the business going, which wasn’t easy, but we did it” – he enjoys the human scale of face-to-face walk-throughs these days. He has been working with stretch gaberdine to make suits more comfortable – which is what everyone wants now – but with construction that maintains the elegant line you get from tailoring.  ‘Baggy jeans look like the next Y2K trend to go mainstream.’ Givenchy at Paris fashion week.  Dries van Noten rented a Parisian townhouse of decaying grandeur, with a sweeping staircase that creaked and handpainted wallpaper flaking from the walls, and filled it with vintage mannequins, which he dressed in lean zebra-print skirts over giraffe-striped boots, or quilted coats with shoulders as round as haloes. He wore a kingfisher-blue scarf wrapped around his neck against the chill of a house unoccupied for half a century as he showed his audience around, proudly pointing out tailoring details and embroidery techniques. The clothes were treasures, collectors’ items, but the bones of the looks – skirts over boots, poshed-up puffer coats – were quiet trends that recurred through the week.    Quiet fashion might just be the next big thing. Not quiet as in dressed down and switched off, but quiet as in low-key. Perhaps this was coming anyway. Before this show season was overtaken by world events, the buzz was around the imminent return of Phoebe Philo, the British designer beloved during her time at Celine for her clothes, which were quirky enough to be cult and sophisticated enough to be chic. The likelihood of Philo’s own brand resetting the dial toward something cool-toned and subtle was somewhere in the field of vision of designers as they put together these collections over the winter, even if the sober mood of now was unforeseeable. Philo’s heralded return has not materialised, as yet; I suspect it’s on ice until the world is ready to care about such things again.    What does quiet fashion look like? It’s a slightly too big blazer over a small, vaguely skimpy top – which could be a bra top, but could also be a knit vest, or a lace-trimmed camisole. The big-jacket, small-top look is a “but make it fashion” version of the plain old blazer over a shirt. Quiet fashion is a knee-high boot with a skirt, as I mentioned before, or a quilted coat. It is baggy jeans, which look like the next Y2K trend to go mainstream. It is checks of any kind, and loafers with everything, because preppy is the new streetwear. The colour of the season is the quietest of them all: brown.  “This feels really strange, doesn’t it?” said Stella McCartney, one of the designers who did stage a proper show, backstage at the Pompidou Centre. “Doing a show when Covid was going on felt pretty strange, but this feels even stranger and sadder and more surreal.” Even though it is part of my job, sitting in front of a catwalk feels intensely uneasy right now, in a way that sitting in front of my laptop now does not. For many designers who were staging physical shows, it was their first time doing so since the pandemic began, and they were not minded, for that reason, to cancel, so they groped for some way of reaching across the chasm, to keep faith with the real world, with varying degrees of success. The mood of the show is about more than clothes, which is why many designers altered their soundtracks at the last minute. The Hungarian brand Nanushka played the Ukrainian national anthem; Valentino presaged the show with a voice note by its creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, saying that he went ahead with his show – where the venue was painted hot pink, a specific new shade that will be added to Pantone’s official colour scale – because, he said, the collection represented work, and love.    Rick Owens, who had been planning to play music by electronica artist Eprom, switched to the adagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. He said he would normally think it too sentimental a choice, but felt it was “better suited for the sobriety and search for hope in our current condition”. The inflated, off-kilter jackets and slinky keyholed hooded robes, which were somehow both monastic and a bit S&M, were deeply strange but very beautiful. “During times of heartbreak, beauty can be one of the ways to maintain faith,” Owens said.

I was 22 when I started. Each time I descended into the missile silo, I had to be ready to launch, at a moment’s notice, a nuclear weapon that could wipe a city the size of New York off the face of the earth.  On the massive blast door of the launch control center, someone had painted a mural of a Domino’s pizza logo with the macabre caption, “World-wide delivery in 30 minutes or less or your next one is free.”  Since Russia invaded Ukraine, I’ve heard more discussions of nuclear war than I did in the entire nine years that I wore an air force uniform. I’m glad that people are finally discussing the existential dangers of nuclear weapons. There have been more near-misses than the world knows.  Greg Devlin was an airman assigned to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) team in Arkansas in 1980. One night he responded to a leak in the missile’s fuel tank. A young airman working in an ICBM launch tube had accidentally dropped a socket from his toolkit; the socket fell down the silo, ricocheted, and pierced a hole in the stage-one fuel tank. The missile’s liquid fuel exploded. Devlin was thrown 60ft down an asphalt road and watched as a massive fireball rose overhead.  The ICBM had a nine-megaton warhead – the most powerful single nuclear weapon in American history – on top. When the missile exploded, the warhead was thrown into the woods, disappearing into the night.  “I was stunned and in pain but I knew the nuke hadn’t gone off,” Devlin told me, “because I remembered those stories from Hiroshima where people had been turned into little charcoal briquettes. I was alive. That’s how I knew the nuke didn’t detonate.” Although the nuclear warhead didn’t explode, the accident still claimed the life of one airman and injured 21 others, including Devlin.  When I was training as a nuclear missile operator, my instructor told me the story of what happened in Arkansas that night in 1980. It’s a famous story within the missile community. Stories like these were a way of impressing upon young officers the integrity required to be a good steward of these weapons and a warning of how quickly things can go wrong. That warning was very much on my mind as I began my first “alert” down in the claustrophobic underground missile silo that housed the launch control center.  But somewhere along my way to nearly 300 nuclear “alerts” – 24-hour shifts in command of a launch crew – I began to brush the story off as a scare tactic for rookies. Similarly, I think that after the end of the cold war, the general public allowed the threat of nuclear warfare to recede into the background. The threat simply didn’t feel real to new generations like it did to those who grew up huddling under their desks during nuclear attack drills in elementary school.  And the young crews who steward this nuclear arsenal today aren’t immune from the post-cold war malaise. In 2013, during my first year on crew, 11 ICBM officers were implicated in a drug scandal. The following year, 34 ICBM launch officers were implicated in a cheating scandal on their monthly proficiency exams.  Deborah Lee James, the secretary of the air force at the time, said, “This was a failure of integrity on the part of some of our airmen. It was not a failure of our nuclear mission.”  As the war in Ukraine is reminding us, life with nuclear weapons is not safer or more peaceful  In this attempt to save face, Secretary James revealed a state of dissonance that every nuclear missile operator lives with. We are told, day in and day out, that our integrity is crucial to the deterrent value of nuclear weapons and helps make the world a safer place. But what man or woman of integrity could possibly launch a nuclear weapon?  As the war in Ukraine is reminding us, life with nuclear weapons is not safer or more peaceful. If you study nuclear warfare, you’ll learn about “megatons” and nuclear yields, stockpiles and budget expenditures. These numbers quantify the enormous danger of nuclear weapons but also, in rendering that danger abstract, obfuscate it.  Greg Devlin has a different set of numbers from his experience with missiles. “Since that explosion I’ve had 13 spine surgeries and two spinal stimulators. I lived the last decade of my life on morphine,” said Devlin.  Nuclear weapons turn the most important parts of life into nothing more than numbers – which is exactly the thought process needed for a society that believes that launching a nuclear missile is a viable solution to conflict. Because in the wake of a nuclear attack there will be no individuals, only numbers.

In the week when the European Union welcomed nearly two million refugees from Ukraine, do we also need to watch graphic footage of a young African being battered for climbing a European border fence? Yes, we do.  As Europe rediscovers compassion for refugees, we should watch this video on loop. It shows a defenceless young man in tattered clothes gingerly descending a six-metre fence. Waiting for him at the bottom are half a dozen Spanish border police, in helmets and body armour and wielding batons. The first blow is struck before he reaches the ground. The images that follow, of a crowd of uniformed white men viciously beating a black man, are all the more disturbing because they are so familiar.  Spain’s Melilla, one of two small exclaves of EU land on the African continent, has long been the strongest distillation of fortress Europe. Melilla’s ring-fenced honey pot of golf courses, casinos and corruption have provided these images before. But now it is especially important to look at them and think hard.  A generation of people across Europe have spent the last several days wondering where they would go, what they would take with them if a larger war erupted. The distance and sense of otherness that helped us ignore the war in Syria or the collapse of Afghanistan have not been on offer in Ukraine.  There are compelling reasons why the war in Ukraine has prompted Europe’s rediscovery of compassion. As a British army veteran and volunteer in Ukraine said, “it’s a black-and-white war”, or, as others point out, Ukraine is a country next door. There are questions of culture and then, of course, there is race.  The war in Ukraine creates asylum seekers who fit the simplest definition of a refugee. Thus far, they are mainly women and children, and they are seen on TV to be crossing a single border. Coming after a dark and divisive period in which asylum in Europe has been under real threat, with lives lost and border walls built, the outpouring of compassion is moving and welcome. But the simplification and segregation are not. The Ukraine refugees are crossing into Poland, a country still busy constructing a wall along the Belarus stretch of its border to prevent the entry of Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis.  There have been disturbing levels of discrimination faced by non-European-heritage refugees fleeing the Russian onslaught in Ukraine itself. The reporting of this needs to be presented with nuance, context and balance. Not everything presented as racism should be so simply described. But there have been verified incidents of people of colour being barred from evacuation trains, being segregated and made to wait for days at border crossings.    There will be those who imagine that open arms for Ukrainians and fortress Europe for black and brown refugees can and should co-exist. They are wrong, and not only on an obvious moral level. Too many commentators in Europe have already fallen into the trap of separating deserving and undeserving refugees. Their rightful praise for Ukrainians has been laced with references to supposed exceptional qualities such as pluck and fighting spirit. These are insults that are heard and understood by Syrians, Afghans and others, who have been recently received with brutality at some of the same borders and, in the case of Syria, after fighting the same aggressor.  The segregation of black refugees at some of Ukraine’s exit points and the double standards on who gets to remain in the EU offer Putin and other malign actors a playbook for destabilising the EU. The plaintive panic with which Poland and Brussels received the prospect of a few thousands Iraqis, Afghans and Syrians arriving via Belarus offers a glaring weakness to exploit.  The neighbourhood authoritarians from Moscow and Minsk to Ankara know that Europe would rather be blackmailed than reach a consensus on resettlement of asylum seekers across the EU. The deals with Turkey and Libya to warehouse refugees and migrants have made vulnerable people into a commodity, and turned our borderlands into desperate and lawless places.  These are political choices defended by recourse to lies: that Europe is unfairly burdened with refugees it can ill afford to support. These are arguments that Jordan or Turkey can maintain, but they make no sense when deployed by an ageing Europe.  Meanwhile, the response to Ukrainians’ suffering is demolishing specious old arguments about cost and space. This refugee relief effort will cost €30bn in its first year, according to the Centre for Global Development. The UNHCR foresees at least 4 million refugees being forcibly displaced, and happily the voices quibbling over these costs are few to none.  Some will be tempted to harden the fortress, to argue that Europe is full now that it shelters Ukrainians. The arrival of a refugee crisis that we are right to embrace and support is also the time to reconsider the mistakes made since 2015. The commodification of refugees and the fragility we advertise with military responses in the Aegean in 2020 and the Belarus standoff in 2021 guarantee more of what EU governments call “hybrid wars”.  Today’s actual war explodes the excuses that a rich and shrinking Europe has offered to defend its fortress. What is left is racism. It is what was waiting for the young man in tattered clothes at the foot of a giant fence. And an openly racist Europe defeats most of what we claim is at stake in terms of values in the war in Ukraine.

Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale last week and interest in the club is growing. Candy, a Chelsea fan, wants to submit a bid and the 49-year-old is talking to American investors as he tries to build a consortium capable of rivalling Boehly’s and Wyss’s group.  Sources have said that Candy, whose proposal would include a plan to redevelop Stamford Bridge, will be unable to bid on his own. The success of any offer he puts to Abramovich will depend on who he can bring on board.  It has been reported that Abramovich, who has faced calls in parliament for him to be sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine, is looking for as much as £4bn for Chelsea. It remains to be seen whether the Russian will accept a significantly lower fee.  A source noted that Abramovich’s desire for a quick sale could lower his leverage in negotiations. However the 55-year-old is understood to want prospective buyers to show that they have a viable plan and funds to ensure Chelsea remain successful. Abramovich does not want the legacy he has built at Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 to go to waste.  Candy, worth a reported 1.5bn, could boost his chances by committing to rebuild Stamford Bridge. Chelsea’s ground is smaller than their rivals’. There have been suggestions that the cost of a redevelopment could put off bidders.  Abramovich is considering how to proceed after receiving an opening proposal from the consortium fronted by Boehly and Wyss. The size of the offer remains unknown but it is unlikely to be significantly higher than £2bn. Wyss, an 86-year-old Swiss billionaire, has gone on the record to say that Abramovich’s asking price is too high.  Quick Guide Following the money: who is Hansjörg Wyss? Show Born in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes – with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (£14.8bn). What is he worth now? A more modest $5.8bn (£4.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation – focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics – holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (£751m) to environmental causes. Any controversies? His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism – but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung how voters had been “deceived by populist statements... For the British people’s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.” So why Chelsea? He hasn’t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn’t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist, had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: "One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.” David Hills Photograph: Georgios Kefalas/KEYSTONE Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  Beyond the finances, Wyss and Boehly must convince Abramovich that they are the right people to take the club forward. One well-placed figure suggested that Abramovich is unsure about selling to them.  Wyss and Boehly, who part-owns the LA Dodgers, are sitting tight as they await a response. The identities of the other figures who have formed their consortium remain unknown.  Abramovich, who vehemently denies allegations linking him to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state or that he has done anything to merit sanctions, has appointed the New York-based bank Raine to oversee the sale. Interested parties have been given until 15 March to submit bids. It is unlikely Abramovich would be permitted to sell Chelsea if the UK government imposed sanctions on him.  There has been speculation that Chelsea’s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. The Chicago Cubs chairman, Thomas Ricketts, has been mentioned and there is reported interest from Josh Harris, although his stake in Crystal Palace could be a complicating factor.

Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, last week signalled his interest in buying Chelsea and on Tuesday said he would hold further talks with Abramovich’s representatives on Thursday.  The uncertainty at Chelsea could have an impact on contract negotiations with Antonio Rüdiger, Andreas Christensen and César Azpilicueta. Barcelona are close to signing Christensen on a free, although Bayern Munich have not pulled out of the race for the Denmark defender. Barça are also confident Azpilicueta will strengthen their defence on a free.

The prop Cian Healy will make his first start of this year’s tournament, and win his 115th cap, in place of the injured Andrew Porter, while Hugo Keenan, Andrew Conway, Bundee Aki and James Ryan also return. Andy Farrell’s side must win at Twickenham to remain in contention for the championship.  Sexton came off the bench during the 57-6 round-three victory over Italy after missing the defeat by France in Paris with a minor hamstring problem. The 36-year-old, who this week signed a contract extension and announced he will retire after next year’s World Cup, has regained the No 10 jersey from Joey Carbery and will win his 104th cap.  📋 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭.

The lock Iain Henderson is back among the replacements after a positive coronavirus test ruled him out against the Italians.  Ireland have lost five of seven away matches under head coach Farrell, including a pair of emphatic Twickenham defeats in 2020. They triumphed in their last meeting with Eddie Jones’ men, an impressive 32-18 success in Dublin condemning England to their worst campaign in Six Nations history.  Quick Guide Georgia seal Rugby World Cup spot after Russia games scrapped Show Georgia have officially qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup as a result of World Rugby's decision to suspend Russia and Belarus from all cross-border competition. That decision was announced on 1 March, but a tournament board meeting on Thursday confirmed that Russia's remaining qualifiers would be scrapped with Georgia, Netherlands and Portugal awarded four points as the nominal winners. That means Georgia, who were firmly on course to qualify regardless, are now assured of a top-two finish in the qualification standings. They are almost certain to finish top and join Wales, Australia and Fiji in Pool C, with Spain, Portugal and Romania in contention for second place. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  The returning loosehead Healy will pack down alongside Leinster teammates Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong on the occasion of his 115th cap, with the vice-captain, Ryan, overcoming an adductor issue to join Tadhg Beirne in the second row. Caelan Doris has retained the No 8 jersey ahead of Jack Conan, and will again be flanked by Peter O’Mahony at blindside and Josh Van Der Flier at openside.  Sexton resumes his half-back partnership with his provincial teammate Jamison Gibson-Park, while Aki displaces Henshaw to join Garry Ringrose in midfield. James Lowe continues on the left flank following his two tries against Italy. The international newcomers Lowry – who claimed a debut double against the Azzurri – and Hansen make way for the full-back Keenan and the right wing Conway.  The scrum-half Conor Murray returns to the bench in place of Craig Casey, where he is joined by the forwards Rob Herring, Dave Kilcoyne, Finlay Bealham, Henderson and Conan, plus Carbery and Henshaw. Like Casey, Ulster pair Kieran Treadwell and James Hume also drop out of the 23 following cameo appearances last time out.

Dan Sabbagh explains what more the world’s most powerful military alliance could do – and why full intervention is off the table for now  When the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed the UK parliament this week via video link from his bunker, he had one overriding message: we need more help to fight off Russia’s attacks and specifically we need a no-fly zone. But as the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tells Michael Safi, a no-fly zone is not happening. To do so would mean Nato forces directly engaging Russian aircraft and would risk escalating the war into a European, possibly nuclear, one.  It has left the west with an impossible dilemma: stand back and watch Ukrainian cities be reduced to rubble with the deaths of many more civilians inevitable. Or intervene and risk a nuclear conflagration of the kind the world has never seen. It’s a tightrope being walked in western capitals as world leaders calibrate their next tranche of economic sanctions and weigh up what military equipment can be sent to Ukraine without provoking a catastrophic response from Vladimir Putin.

The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion.  They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership.  In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed.  Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend.  Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border.  It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000.  For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack  Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far?  Putin: pursuing an old Soviet glory? Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Vladimir Putin  The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded.  A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema.  Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy.  Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia.  More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep.  Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas.  At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word.  Joe Biden: a message to China as well as to Russia. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  Joe Biden  The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster.  Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state.  Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan.  Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move.  Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.  Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution.  Zelenskiy: under pressure to go slowly on Nato membership. Photograph: Reuters  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine’s president impressed world leaders in the Munich security conference this weekend with a brave and punchy speech after ignoring warnings to stay at home for fear of a Russian-inspired coup attempt. His response to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put.  One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides.  Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s.  True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force.  Scholz and Macron: soft line and hard line? Photograph: Getty Images  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz  Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises.  These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war.  Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front.  While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions.  Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights.  That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach.  The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far.  Johnson (right, with Zelenskiy): errand boy for America? Photograph: Getty Images  Boris Johnson  Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it.  At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally.  The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid.  But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff.  Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London.  All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America.  When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.

On 8 February, the US army released its climate strategy.  Among other tactics, the army aims for net-zero emissions by 2050, to electrify its combat and non-tactical vehicles, to power its bases with “carbon-free” electricity and to develop clean global supply chains.  Wars, like the one Russia has unleashed on Ukraine, are extreme polluters, and while the army’s plan would significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, experts say it does not do nearly enough.  “The Department of Defense, the entity that is the US war machine, is the largest institutional contributor to global warming on planet Earth,” said David Vine, a professor of political anthropology at American University in Washington DC. “And the military does not acknowledge that.”  It does, at least, state that there is a need to reduce its “impact on the planet”. The Army Climate Strategy (ACS) admits, for example, that the US army’s nearly $740m yearly expenditure on electricity created 4.1m tons of greenhouse gases in 2020 – 1m tons more than the greenhouse gas emissions generated by Switzerland’s heat and electricity sector in 2017.  Although the ACS is reflective of the Pentagon’s newly serious stance on the climate crisis, which it has identified as a security threat, critics say the plan misses out on several crucial details.  It lacks accountability mechanisms, for one thing, said Doug Weir, research and policy director at the Conflict and Environment Observatory. “We need to ensure that scrutiny mechanisms are in place. Otherwise, it’s just military-grade greenwash,” he said.  The US military and army, for example, do not report their fuel usage to Congress, let alone itemize how much fuel was spent where, or on what war. Most US government accounting of US greenhouse gas emissions omit figures on how much the military contributes, even via a relatively easy-to-track measure like fuel consumption.  And consume fuel it does, in vast quantities. A 2019 report found that the Department of Defense is not only the largest consumer of energy in the US but is also the world’s largest institutional consumer of petroleum and, thus, the world’s largest institutional emitter of greenhouse gases. Between 2001 and 2017 the DoD was responsible for emitting 1.2bn metric tons of greenhouse gases – equivalent to the annual emissions of 257m cars. This year it is expected to burn through 82.3m barrels of fuel, more than the total oil consumption of Finland.  The plan aims to reduce this number – but a more impactful way for the US military to address the scale and pace of its carbon footprint is to simply do less, said Neta Crawford, political scientist and co-director of Brown University’s Costs of War project.  She points to the fact that the US military has about 800 installations in 80 countries and another 740 bases on home soil, of which about 315 are army installations. Yet by its own admission, the Pentagon says the US army operates a third more bases than it needs – it calls this “excess basing capacity”.  “Far greater savings can be achieved by just closing a base rather than making a base that is unnecessary more energy efficient,” said Vine.

Photograph: David Longstreath/AP  Even that kind of thinking would probably not be enough to reduce the armed forces’ greenhouse gas emissions as much as is needed, however. The military’s climate impact is “not just about the environmental footprint of the military itself, it’s also about the way the operations are conducted and the way wars are fought”, said Stefan Smith, coordinator at the UN Environment Programme’s disasters & conflicts sub-programme.  “War is, by its nature, destructive.”  Postwar reconstruction, for instance, uses up a vast amount of resources. The disposal of rubble and rebuilding from infrastructure destruction is a long, carbon-intensive process, according to Hassan Partow, a UNEP programme manager.  “The amount of trucking and emissions that would be required to dispose of this debris is like travelling from the Earth to the moon multiple times,” he said, referring to cleanups that were required in Iraq.  War also degrades land, altering and reducing its carbon sequestration capacity. “The land degradation legacy in Iraq shows that when you change the land and change the soils, that changes the amount of carbon it can store,” said Weir. To what extent is unclear, as it is rarely if ever studied. But soil erosion causes carbon loss, and desertification and degradation reduce land’s ability to hold carbon – all of which probably happened in Iraq, particularly in what was once marsh land.  “We know so little about” how much land is destroyed in this matter, Weir said. “No one’s really following or documenting it.” He thinks an even larger contributor to the climate crisis than the emissions caused by fighting is the environmental changes those conflicts create.  Of course, the fighting doesn’t help. Some of the first targets in conflict zones are oil infrastructure and power plants, said Partow. The US military has frequently targeted oil tankers in Syria and just last week Russian missiles attacked a number of oil and gas facilities in Ukraine. The resulting fires give rise to heavy emissions. “In the case of Iraq … people could not see the sun from all the emissions,” Partow added. US emissions rose dramatically following the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But even non-violent conflict triggers other emissions.  “When the United States acts to increase its presence in Asia and the Pacific, it alerts the Chinese to the American presence – and they respond by making more weapons which, in turn, produce more emissions,” said Crawford.  What can be done? Rather than only see the climate emergency as a security threat that needs to be trained for, Crawford suggests, the US military should help reduce the emergency itself, and the instability it will cause.  “A much better strategy than preparing for climate change-caused war is to prevent climate change-caused war,” said Crawford.  Federal and military budgeting priorities might also need to shift, according to Lindsay Koshgarian, programme director at the National Priorities Project. The White House is expected to request a military budget of more than $770bn for the next fiscal year.  An M60-A3 tank is deployed in US-Taiwanese exercises in September 2021. Photograph: Daniel Ceng Shou-Yi/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock  “As long as we continue to put that amount of money into the military, we will not have the resources to deal with climate change,” said Koshgarian.  Even so, the ACS is considered an important document. “It does reflect a longstanding concern in the US military – that actually has been much more progressive and advanced than most of the rest of the US government – about global warming and climate change,” said Vine.  The move to electrify army vehicles, for example, is significant in the stimulus it gives to manufacturers to produce more electric vehicles and lower their costs in the rest of the country, said Crawford.  The Department of Defense will incorporate climate risks in its future strategies as well, including the expected national defense strategy, according to Richard Kidd, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. A “comprehensive” climate mitigation and sustainability plan will be released in the fall, he said.  However, the concern remains that these strategies will only treat the symptoms, and only marginally. Although the ACS highlights the need to act “now” – it says so four times in the document – the targets are set over another 20 years.  To Koshgarian, plans like the ACS prompt a bigger question: can any military goals, such as sustained land dominance by any large military, America’s or otherwise, ever be sustainable?  “There’s no such thing as sustainable fast fashion. And there’s no such thing as sustainable global military hegemony.”

She will call for the west to stand up to authoritarian regimes, saying the west must rise to this moment and pledge that it must never allow such aggression to grow unchecked as it had over the past decade.  In previous remarks, she has qualified her attacks on authoritarian regimes by saying some regimes that do not intend to undermine the west can be treated differently. No 10, pressed on Wednesday on whether it regarded Saudi Arabia as an authoritarian regime, hedged.  In her speech to the Atlantic Council, Truss will say: “Putin has launched a full-frontal assault not just on the Ukrainian people, but also on the very foundation of our societies and the rules by which we coexist – sovereignty, democracy, the UN charter.  “He has shattered the architecture of global security. The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11. How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era.  “If we let Putin’s expansionism go unchallenged it would send a dangerous message to would-be aggressors and authoritarians around the world. We can’t allow that to happen.  “We must start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strength … and we must start by working together to stop Putin’s offensive in Ukraine.”  She will insist: “That means acting now. It means being tough – because we know that the costs will only rise if we don’t. The public understands the gravity of this moment. They see the terrible suffering caused by this pre-planned, barbaric and illegal invasion against a European democracy and they recognise that the world has changed.”  She will again call for ending strategic dependence on hostile and authoritarian states, citing the threat posed by Russian energy.  In remarks that are largely directed at countries that are most dependent on Russian energy, such as Italy and Germany, she will say: “We must go further on sanctions to keep tightening the vice – including a full Swift ban, freezing all Russian banking assets, and encouraging more countries to join the effort.”  Germany has been pressing for Russian energy-related banks to be kept within the Swift banking system.  Truss will say: “We want a situation where they can’t access their funds, they can’t clear their payments, their trade can’t flow, their ships can’t dock and their planes can’t land. We must work together to ensure justice is done at the International Criminal Court and Putin is held to account for his actions.  “And we must do more to deliver defensive weapons and respond to the growing humanitarian emergency. We will do all of this. And we will shape this new era for global security.”  Truss is also expected to deliver a message to the US Congress that the UK is acting against Russian oligarchs following mounting criticism amongst US politicians and media outlets that the UK has laid out the welcome mat for the oligarchs and is now finding it difficult, mainly for legal reasons, to take the tough action being shown by the EU and the US.  The UK is passing legislation that will allow it to sanction anyone in the UK jurisdiction so long as they have been sanctioned by the US, Canada or the EU, a move that is some distance from the original claim by Brexiters that a distinct UK sanctions regime would make the UK regime more agile.  It instead appears that the Foreign Office fears the UK legislation, due to amendments passed by parliament, provides too many avenues through which Russian oligarchs can appeal sanction designations in the courts.

In a one-line statement, Rio Tinto said it was “in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business”.  Rio is reviewing its joint venture with Rusal in Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL) which runs an alumina refinery in Gladstone.  Thursday’s decision creates a fuel supply problem for Rio’s Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, which relies on Russian diesel.  It comes as more western businesses turn their backs on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, with Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other big brands joining the rush for the exit in the past 24 hours, amid sanctions that have laid waste to large sections of the Russian economy.  QAL is 80% owned by Rio and 20% by Rusal, where Deripaska continues to hold a stake through their London-listed parent company, EN+ Group.  Deripaska and EN+ were among the oligarchs and companies sanctioned in 2018 by the US government over issues including the invasion of Crimea in 2014.  Activist investors, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), welcomed the decision by Rio and another Australian company, engineering group Worley, to pull out of Russia.  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  “We look forward to seeing more detail about the implications for Rio Tinto’s Queensland Alumina joint venture,” ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said.  “Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, all Australian companies should sever relationships with companies owned or part-owned by oligarchs aligned with Russian president Vladimir Putin.  “Rio Tinto and Worley should be commended for taking appropriate action.”  In a statement to the Australian stock exchange, Worley said it had “begun the safe withdrawal of its services provided in and into Russia and will not enter into new contracts”.  The decision will not have a material impact on Worley’s global business, the company said.

The global lender said Ukrainian authorities had cancelled an existing standby lending arrangement with the IMF but they would work together to design an appropriate economic programme focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permitted.  “The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,” the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said after the meeting, predicting a deep recession in Ukraine this year.  “Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues,” she said. Once the war was over, Ukraine was likely to need additional “large support”.  Vladyslav Rashkovan, Ukraine’s alternate executive director at the IMF, gave an emotional and deeply personal speech at the board meeting about the devastation caused by the war and its impact on its people, a source familiar with the meeting said.  His remarks were met with spontaneous applause, a rare event at such meetings. In its statement on the new funding, the Russian executive director, Aleksei Mozhin, who is the board’s most senior member and serves as its honorary dean, spoke only briefly, telling members: “I pray for peace,” the source said.  The IMF said the war had resulted in very serious consequences, citing the departure of more than 2 million people from the country in 13 days and destruction of key infrastructure. Russia calls the assault a “special military operation”.  The disbursement under the IMF’s rapid financing instrument (RFI), equivalent to 50% of Ukraine’s quota in the IMF, would help fund urgent spending needs in the short term, while helping to catalyse financing from other partners, the IMF said.  The RFI provides rapid funding to IMF member countries without the need for a fully fledged programme. Members can tap the RFI repeatedly within any three-year period if the balance of payments need is caused by an exogenous shock, according to the IMF website.  It comes on top of $700m disbursed to Ukraine by the IMF in December, and $2.7bn in IMF special drawing rights, or emergency reserves, that Ukraine received as part of an IMF allocation in August.  The World Bank’s executive board on Monday approved a $723m package of loans and grants for Ukraine.

Russia has blocked access to Facebook and has limited Twitter in an attempt to try to restrict the flow of information about its war in Ukraine. Both companies have said they are working on restoring access to people inside Russia even as they restrict the country’s state media from their services.  Known as an “onion” service, users can access this version of Twitter if they download the Tor browser, which allows people to access sites on what is also referred to as the “dark web”. Instead of .com, onion sites have a .onion suffix.  While the term “dark web” connotes illegal sites such as the now-defunct Silk Road drug market, it is also often used by people seeking to remain anonymous for their safety and also to access sites censored by repressive governments.  Facebook and other sites such as the BBC also have versions accessible on Tor.  Software engineer and internet security expert Alec Muffett, who has worked with other companies to set up onion sites, announced Twitter’s new service on his own Twitter account.  “This is possibly the most important and long-awaited tweet that I’ve ever composed,” he wrote on Tuesday.  Russia has broadened its efforts to control the spread of information on the invasion of Ukraine and to move against independent news sources and social media websites.  Last week, Russian officials blocked access to Facebook in retaliation for the platforms placing restrictions on state-owned media.

Until now, the Russian embassy has taken its address from nearby Latvian Street, whose name remains unchanged.  But a hitherto nameless smaller road leading straight to the embassy acquired the Ukrainian moniker.  Simasius had announced the move last week and on Wednesday workers put up two new street plates with the name in Lithuanian and Ukrainian.  This is not the first time Vilnius has used signs and symbols to get its point across to Russia.  In 2018, the city renamed a square outside the embassy after Boris Nemtsov, a prominent opposition figure gunned down near the Kremlin by unknown assailants.  Latvia, a fellow Baltic state, has also made use of the tactic.  Officials from the capital Riga agreed last week to rename the Russian embassy’s address to “Independent Ukraine Street”.

With gas prices in California surging, she’d have to use more than half of that to cover fuel for the day, leaving her with just $45.  The rising cost of gas has made a difficult job all the more difficult, Zabaleta said, forcing her to spend more time behind the wheel to earn enough to afford living in one of the country’s most expensive cities.  US gas prices have reached record highs in recent weeks, surging in part by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after already having been high for months. California drivers are paying the most of any in the country, at an average of $5.57 a gallon, according to AAA.  Rising prices are hitting gig workers particularly hard as fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs. Uber and Lyft drivers already struggling after the pandemic hit both wages and working conditions say paying more at the pump means they have to spend more time driving in order to achieve the same level of pay. Some are spending more than 60 hours a week working, and some say driving is simply no longer profitable.  Zabaleta, who has driven for Lyft for two years, paid $5.20 a gallon to fill up this week. Meanwhile, factoring in the cost of gas, her income came out to about $9 an hour, far below San Jose’s $16.20 minimum wage. Zabaleta routinely spends as many as 50 hours a week behind the wheel, giving herself just one day off, and is working more to cover the increasing costs.  Even before gas prices started rising, pay was becoming increasingly unpredictable driving for Lyft, she said. She previously drove five days a week, but with fewer passengers during the pandemic and fewer bonuses from Lyft, Zabaleta had to add an extra work day to her week in order to maintain the same level of income, she said. Companies such as Lyft aren’t doing enough to help drivers, she said.  “This job should be something the worker should enjoy doing – this is a job that’s high risk and we’re putting our lives on the line everyday,” she said.  Other drivers said that without increased wages or other support from rideshare companies to help alleviate the burden of fuel costs, driving will no longer be worthwhile.  Rondu Gantt started working as a rideshare driver in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018 to supplement his income, but began driving full-time after his teaching job left him burnt out. Since then wages have only dropped, he said, and without the bonuses the companies offer, the job wouldn’t be profitable at all.  US gas prices have reached record highs in recent weeks and California drivers are paying the most of any in the country. Photograph: Ringo Chiu/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock  “We’re at the point where we need the companies to pay bonuses every week just to make the job sustainable,” he said. The normal pay rate is too low, he said, so in addition to driving during the day, he routinely returns to the road at night when surge pricing is in effect.  The expensive price of gas has made the job more challenging, Gantt said. “My costs are higher, my pay is the same, so I’m losing money. That’s a mathematical reality,” he said.  Benjamin Valdez, who drives part-time for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles and works as an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said he hasn’t driven for two weeks because of the high gas prices. When fuel costs go up, drivers stay out on the road for longer in order to try to make a profit, he said, which means there is more competition for rides.  The loss in income is difficult for his family, Valdez said, but with gas prices as high as they are and more drivers out on the road, he’d be losing money driving. “I only drive when it’s profitable, which is few and far between right now,” he said.  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said he will propose a tax rebate to help the state’s drivers grapple with the increasing costs at the pump. Drivers are also hoping to see companies such as Lyft and Uber take steps to help support them amid the high prices, which experts say will likely continue for months.  Organizers with Rideshare Drivers United are petitioning the rideshare companies to raise compensation and “set the rates fairly and equitably because of our increased costs”, said Daniel Russell, a part-time Uber driver and organizer with RDU.  When asked if Lyft would offer additional support to drivers as fuel costs increase, Lyft spokesperson CJ Macklin said it had taken concrete steps to help, including a fuel cash-back program run in partnership with GetUpside. Macklin also said that US drivers are now seeing greater average hourly pay than they were a year ago, even with high fuel prices, as more riders return to the platform. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Vitalii Konstantinov, who drives for Uber in San Diego and works with Rideshare Drivers United, said rising costs have forced him to dip into his family’s budget, and cancel a trip to Disneyland he had planned for his young children. He’s actively looking for other jobs.  “It’s not worth driving for Uber anymore,” he said.  Gantt said he’s also considering leaving the industry.  “It is unsustainable for me to feel comfortable in this industry right now. I feel the vulnerability. I see how reliant I am on them to give me a bonus, I see how low the rate is,” he said. “I can’t work 16 hours every day. I’m gonna burn out. It’s physically demanding to be tired, drinking coffee, under-rested, and driving morning and night.”

It was June 2021, and a few weeks earlier Ruiz, a 28-year-old banana farmer from central Mexico, had been abducted by a group of armed men and taken to an isolated ranch where 15 others – 13 men and two women – were being held.  The assailants were members of an ultra-violent Mexican cartel fighting to take over the local banana industry, and needed to recruit locals as informants and hitmen in order to push out a rival gang and community self-defense force.  Ruiz was beaten with planks of wood and wire, leaving him with two broken ribs, gashes across his back and unable to see out of his right eye. Photos seen by the Guardian confirm the injuries.  According to Ruiz, he and five others were forced to kill and bury the rest of the detainees while gang members filmed the macabre acts. They took Ruiz’s motorbike, wallet and bank details before abandoning him on the road near his home. His bank account was emptied a few days later.  The family fled as soon as Ruiz was strong enough to travel and arrived in Sonoyta, a small border town in the state of Sonora, hoping to seek asylum in the US.  But the border was closed due to Title 42 – an arcane public health order issued in March 2020 by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under pressure from the Trump administration.  By and large immigration policy hasn’t changed under Biden, and that’s the problem. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at American Immigration  “We were traumatised and terrified, with nowhere else to go,” said Ruiz, tearing up while recounting his experiences.  Title 42, which the Biden government has elected to keep in place, has led to hundreds of thousands of people being denied their legal right to seek asylum since the start of the pandemic.  The order effectively replaced Remain in Mexico – another controversial Trump-era deterrent policy also known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) – and has used the pretext of Covid to authorize more than 1.4m expulsions at the border in the past two years.  “By and large immigration policy hasn’t changed under Biden, and that’s the problem,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the Washington-based American Immigration.  Across the border, huge numbers of people are stuck – unable to move forward or go back.  Ruiz said: “Title 42 has prevented us from living, everyday I wake up and nothing has changed. But the pandemic is just an excuse, as if people without papers can get Covid and those with papers are immune.”  For the past eight months, the family has lived in a shelter, unable to venture more than a few blocks in fear of being apprehended by Mexican authorities or criminals. Their daughter, a bright shy girl with a big smile who just turned seven, misses school and her grandparents; their one-year-old son recently learned to walk.  “I don’t know whether to cry or scream, we’re stuck and have no idea when this will end,” said Hernandez, 23, Ruiz’s wife.  Volunteers with the Ajo Samaritans cross the Sonoran desert. Photograph: The Guardian  Sonoyta is an unremarkable desert town with 20,000 people, a booming asparagus industry, and a minor border crossing popular with American snowbird retirees and tourists heading to the beach.  For people here the situation is worse under Biden: there’s no progress, few exceptions, and no updates. John Orlowski from Shelters for Hope  The town also has four shelters where almost 200 Mexicans and Central Americans had been stuck for months or more, hoping the Biden administration would rescind title 42.  But last month, about a third left after immigration attorneys visiting the migrant resource centre told them that the border would likely remain shut unless pending litigation succeeded in exempting families from title 42.  It’s not clear where they all went, but some tried their luck seeking asylum at other border crossings like Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which borders Phar, Texas), where the state governor banned Biden from expelling families with children under seven. Others paid coyotes or smugglers to cross the Sonoran desert – where thousands of people have died trying to traverse the remote, punishing terrain.  “Title 42 has nothing to do with Covid, it’s a terrific vehicle for stopping immigration,” said John Orlowski from Shelters for Hope, a non-profit which helped set-up the resource centre that provides meals, clothes, internet and medical care. “For people here the situation is worse under Biden: there’s no progress, few exceptions, and no updates.”  In essence, title 42 has prohibited the vast majority of Mexicans and Central Americans from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala – the countries which historically account for most migrants and refugees – from being allowed to seek asylum in the US.  Across the southern border, just over half of all arrivals have been turned away and expelled to Mexico or flown home on charter flights since the start of the pandemic, including thousands of Haitian asylum seekers. (Millions of Americans and those with visas enter the country overland and by plane every month.)  But in south-west Arizona, where Trump constructed a 30ft border wall across the Sonoran desert through sacred Indigenous land and protected national parks, more than 80% of people have been expelled without the opportunity to make their case.  “The Tucson sector has one of the highest expulsion rates along the border and the exemptions have no rhyme or reason which leaves people desperate. The Biden administration keeps hiding behind the CDC but the evidence suggests that title 42 has become part of the deterrent policy, and has nothing to do with public health,” said Reichlin-Melnick.  There’s a major US customs and border protection (CBP) station between Sonoyta and Ajo, Arizona – a former mining community now popular with retirees, artists and humanitarian groups.  But desperate people do desperate things, and this area has seen the highest level of desert deaths ever recorded.  On a hot cloudless day last week, the Guardian accompanied volunteers from Ajo Samaritans on a tough hike to drop gallons of water and cans of beans in two remote areas where people are currently passing through.  It was deep into the desert – a two-hour drive from Ajo, followed by a nine-mile round trip on foot through Organ Pipe Cactus national monument and Cabeza Prieta wildlife refuge – with virtually no shade. In the summer, temperatures regularly top 100F (38C).  Volunteers leave water, beans, Gatorade and a medical blanket in a shady spot in the desert where migrants have been passing through. Photograph: Nina Lakhani/The Guardian  As migrants are forced to take longer, harder routes to avoid surveillance technology and border patrols, humanitarian groups struggle to keep up and get water to the right places.  But amid the vast desolate cacti forest there were signs of recent human activity: empty energy drink cans, a pair of ripped beige jeans, a black cardigan and several worn out carpet shoes – makeshift denim slippers to avoid leaving footprints. Three gallons of water left by the volunteers a week earlier – their first drop at this location – were gone.  The group came across two degraded bones in separate locations. Each was photographed and sent to the Pima county coroner, the location tagged on GPS, and the spot marked with a dated red ribbon. This was followed by a moment’s silence to reflect on the 3,830 immigrants who have died in the Arizona Sonora desert, and the disappeared not yet found.  The coroner later confirmed that neither bone was human. Still, two degraded human remains have been found during water drops by these volunteers in the past fortnight. In January, 15 bodies were found across the desert, most months after they had died, according to Humane Borders and Pima county. In 2021, 226 mostly recently deceased bodies were recovered, a record high.  “This isn’t just about title 42 or Remain in Mexico, it’s the prevention through detention (PTD) policy and continued increase in militarization of the border since 1994, which has forced people further and further into the desert. The PTD legislation is designed to kill people, and since its implementation the number of deaths has increased every year,” said Jo, a seasoned volunteer who asked for her surname be withheld.  A sign in the Sonoran desert. Photograph: Nina Lakhani/The Guardian  In his 2022 State of the Union address, Biden’s promise to reform immigration was met with derision by advocates.  “President Biden is not just carrying out the toxic, white supremacist legacy of the Trump era, but unbelievably in some instances he has doubled down,” said Erika Andiola of the advocacy group Raices, in response to the speech.  Both the White House and the CDC recently relaxed guidance on Covid public health measures as part of the “new phase” of the pandemic, without mentioning title 42.  Avril Benoît, executive director of Doctors Without Borders USA, said: “The Biden administration is promoting a policy of learning to live with the virus, yet continues applying title 42 to turn away people seeking protection in the US … This is an outrageous double standard.”  While the administration asked the supreme court to overturn a lower court decision blocking the end of Remain in Mexico, it has also expanded the pool of immigrants to which the policy applies. The CDC, which exempted unaccompanied children from title 42 soon after Biden took office, said it continues to review whether the order remains necessary to protect the public health every 60 days.  Back in Sonoyta, Ruiz and Hernandez don’t have the money to pay a coyote to try and cross the dangerous desert or even get them to a different port of entry where they may be allowed to apply for asylum. Even if they could borrow the money, there’s no way of knowing if they would be granted a rare exemption or simply turned away.  Ruiz said: “I had a good job, we were happy. But now we have no choice, we must wait for an opportunity to sit down with someone and explain what happened and why we can never go back.”  *Names have been changed for safety

Concert violinist Vera Lytochenko has become an internet icon of resilience as images of her playing in the underground bomb shelter have inspired an international audience via social media.  When heavy Russian bombing of Ukraine’s north-eastern city of Kharkiv started two weeks ago, Lytovchenko, her professor father and neighbours sought safety in their building’s basement.  “Bombs can fall everywhere in our city, so we decided to go down in the cellar,” the 39-year-old told the Associated Press via Skype during a brief respite from the bombing. “We’re about 12 people now. We have little boys. We have teenagers. We have old women.”  A week into their basement huddle, Lytovchenko decided to try to lift the group’s spirits by holding small concerts.  “All these people are my brothers and sisters now,” she said. “I was trying to make them think about something and not about the war for some minutes while I’m playing.”  Later, she thought to post her recitals, featuring the calming strains of Vivaldi and even Lytovchenko singing a Russian folk song, on social media. The reaction surprised her: more than 40,000 views on Facebook and thousands more on YouTube.  “I didn’t expect that because I was posting just to reach my friends, my relatives. My aunt is near Kyiv and I’m afraid for her,” she said.  “My friends are in different cities all over Ukraine and I’m trying to keep a connection with them, I text them several times a day to know if they’re alive.  “Many people text me now saying that my videos give them such support and hope. They can see that someone stays here [in Kharkiv]. Someone is alive and someone keeps hope and is optimistic.”  On Wednesday, during the temporary ceasefire in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Lytochenko was able to return to her flat for a few hours. She told the AP she was happy to see sunlight after spending two weeks in the dark basement, adding that she and her neighbours are lucky because they have heating in the cellar and food.  Before the war, Lytovchenko played for the Kharkiv City Opera orchestra and taught music.  “It was another life … a normal life,” she said. “I’m an orchestra player. I am a teacher in college. I have my students, I have friends, I play concerts, I play operas and ballets. I play Italian operas in the theatre.”  Describing Ukraine before the war, Lytochenko said: “We had a cultural life in our country, our cities, in spite of the coronavirus. We were vaccinated. It was a normal life ... but now we can’t understand what is happening.”  Lytovchenko hopes that her posts can help raise funds for Kharkiv’s music community.  “I dream about my little financial fund, because I received messages from all over the world, from all countries.

Russia's war in Ukraine entered the third week with none of its stated objectives reached, despite thousands of people killed, more than two million made refugees and thousands cowering in besieged cities under relentless bombardment.  Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met Russia's Sergei Lavrov in Turkey, but said he had secured no promise from him to halt firing so aid could reach civilians, including Kyiv's main humanitarian priority - evacuating hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the besieged port of Mariupol.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I made a simple proposal to Minister Lavrov: I can call my Ukrainian ministers, authorities, president now and give you 100% assurances on security guarantees for humanitarian corridors," he said.  "I asked him 'can you do the same?' and he did not respond."  Holding his own simultaneous news conference in a separate room, Lavrov showed no sign of making any concessions, repeating Russian demands that Ukraine be disarmed and accept neutral status. He said Kyiv appeared to want meetings for the sake of meetings and that a ceasefire was not meant to be on the agenda at the Turkey talks.  Russia calls its actions a special military operation to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Kyiv and its Western allies say this is a baseless pretext to invade a country of 44 million people.  Aid agencies say humanitarian aid is most urgently needed in Mariupol, where 400,000 people have been trapped for more than a week with no food, water or power. The city council said the port had come under fresh air strikes on Thursday morning, a day after Moscow bombed what Ukraine called a functioning maternity hospital there.  Lavrov said the building was no longer used as a hospital and had been occupied by Ukrainian forces. The Kremlin did not initially repeat that denial and said the incident was being investigated. read more  "What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised address late on Wednesday, after posting footage of the wreckage.  Ukraine said a convoy trying to reach the city had again been turned back by Russian fire on Thursday, and accused Moscow of deliberately blocking aid. Daily attempts at a local humanitarian ceasefire have failed since Saturday.  Lavrov repeatedly lashed out at the West, accusing Western countries of inflaming the situation by arming Ukraine. Asked if the conflict could lead to nuclear war, he said: "I don't want to believe, and I do not believe, that a nuclear war could start."  LITTLE PROGRESS  Moscow's stated objectives of crushing Ukraine's military and removing its leaders have remained out of reach, with Zelenskiy unshaken and Western military aid pouring across the Polish and Romanian borders.  Russian forces have advanced in the south but have yet to capture a single city in the north or east. Western countries have said they believe a planned lightning strike on Kyiv failed in the early days of the war, and Moscow has instead turned to tactics that involve far more destructive assaults.  The UK Defence Ministry said on Thursday that a large Russian column northwest of Kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering continued losses. It added that as casualties mount, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to draw from across the armed forces to replace the losses.  Western-led sanctions designed to cut the Russian economy and government from international financial markets have bitten hard, with the rouble plunging and ordinary Russians rushing to hoard cash. read more  Britain added several Russian businessmen to its blacklist on Thursday, including Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea soccer team. The sanctions would block an attempt to sell the club, but a special license would let it keep playing. read more  'HOSPITAL BOMBED'  Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed the children's hospital on Wednesday, injuring pregnant women and burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal to allow people to flee Mariupol. The regional governor said 17 people were wounded.  The attack underscored U.S. warnings that the biggest assault on a European state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after Russia's early setbacks.  The White House condemned the bombing as a "barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians".  The U.N. Human Rights body said it was trying to verify the number of casualties. The incident "adds to our deep concerns about indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas," it added through a spokesperson.  Russia has repeatedly pledged since Saturday to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape Mariupol. Both sides have blamed the other for the failure of the evacuations.  Half of the more than 2 million total refugees from Ukraine are children. The International Committee of the Red Cross said houses had been destroyed all across Ukraine. "Hundreds of thousands of people have no food, no water, no heat, no electricity and no medical care," it said.

Kuleba told reporters after their meeting in Turkey the most critical situation was in the southern port of Mariupol but that Lavrov did not commit to a humanitarian corridor there and there was no progress on agreeing a wider ceasefire.  "I made a simple proposal to Minister Lavrov: I can call my Ukrainian ministers, authorities, president now and give you 100% assurances on security guarantees for humanitarian corridors," he said.

At a separate news conference, Lavrov said President Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss "specific" issues.  Russia never wants to depend on Western states or companies again, Lavrov said, adding that the West was using Ukraine to undermine Russia and was creating a dangerous sitiation in the region that would persist for many years.  Responding to Kyiv's condemnation of Wednesday's bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Lavrov said the building was no longer used as a hospital and had been occupied by Ukrainian forces, though the Kremlin separately said the incident was being investigated.  Russia's invasion has uprooted more than 2 million people in what the United Nations calls the fastest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two. read more  Moscow has said that all of its demands - including that Kyiv takes a neutral position and drops aspirations of joining the NATO alliance - must be met to end its assault.  Moscow calls its incursion a "special military operation" to disarm Ukraine and dislodge leaders it calls "neo-Nazis." Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.  Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea and has good ties with both, has called Russia's invasion unacceptable and appealed for an urgent ceasefire but has opposed sanctions on Moscow.  While forging close ties with Russia on energy, defence, and trade, and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine, angering Moscow.

Saul Loeb/Pool via REUTERS  WARSAW, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will meet Polish leaders in Warsaw on Thursday amid disagreements with the eastern European country over how to arm Ukraine with warplanes to fight Russia's invasion.  The United States on Tuesday rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force. read more  Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said any supply of fighter jets to Ukraine must be done jointly by NATO countries. However, U.S. officials said they were caught off guard by the proposal and the Pentagon quickly deemed it untenable.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading for NATO to impose a no-fly zone or provide it with fighter jets. The United States and its allies are eager to help Ukraine but are wary of any step that might draw them into direct conflict with Russia.  The U.S. decision not to go ahead with the transfer was criticized by many Republican lawmakers.  "The president should explain exactly why he vetoed fighter jets for Ukraine," Senator Ben Sasse said.  "Two days ago, the secretary of state gave a green light to MiG transfers but now the Department of Defense is raising red flags — what's going on?"  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said U.S. ties with Poland remain strong and she doubted Harris would discuss the issue in a major way on her trip this week to Poland and Romania.  The countries, which are NATO's easternmost members, have been anxious about increasing Russian aggression in the region. They share a border with Ukraine and thousands of refugees are crossing it.  During her visit, Harris is expected to discuss ways NATO members can implement the economic sanctions put in place and how they can stay aligned. She will also meet Ukrainian refugees in Poland and discuss humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine and the region. read more  Poland has accepted more than 1.2 million people escaping Ukraine, while Romania has taken in about 291,081 people fleeing the Russian invasion. More than 2 million people have fled from Ukraine.  Harris will meet Morawiecki and Polish President Andrzej Sebastian Duda on Thursday. She will also meet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been in Europe this week meeting Ukraine allies.

REUTERS/Hannah Mckay  Summary  Summary Companies UK sanctions seven Russians  Group includes Chelsea owner  Chelsea sale put on hold  Trading suspended in Evraz shares  LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Britain imposed sanctions on Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich and Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russian oil giant Rosneft, hitting them with asset freezes and travel bans because of their links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The two billionaires plus Oleg Deripaska and four other Russian oligarchs are the most high-profile businessmen to be added to the British sanctions list since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and follows criticism that Britain has been acting too slowly.  The action puts on ice Abramovich's plans to sell the Premier League club, effectively putting the current European champions under government control. The team can carry on playing, the sports minister said. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin's vicious assault on Ukraine," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.  "We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."  There had been loud calls from British lawmakers for action to be taken against Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs, with criticism that Johnson's government was not moving fast enough compared to the European Union and the United States.  Sechin, who Britain described as Putin's right hand man, was already on the U.S. and EU sanctions lists and last week French authorities seized his yacht. read more  Since the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a 'special military operation', Britain has imposed sanctions on about 20 Russian-linked figures. The EU announced fresh sanctions on Wednesday against 14 more oligarchs, meaning its restrictions apply to 862 people and 53 entities. read more  15 BILLION POUNDS  The others added to the British list were Deripaska, who has stakes in En+ Group, Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of Bank Rossiya, Alexei Miller, the chief executive of energy company Gazprom, and Nikolai Tokarev, the president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft.  In total Britain said the seven figures, who with the exception of Abramovich had previously been sanctioned by the U.S. or the EU, had a collective net worth of 15 billion pounds. ($19.74 billion).  Thursday's action means Abramovich is banned from carrying out transactions with any British individuals and businesses, and cannot enter or stay in Britain. His spokeswoman declined immediate comment.  The 55-year-old, who has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, became one of Russia's most powerful businessmen by earning fabulous fortunes after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes has put his net worth at $13.3 billion.  He bought Chelsea in 2003 for a reported 140 million pounds and his investment contributed hugely to the most successful era in the team's history as they won five Premier League titles, five FA Cups and the Champions League twice.  They beat Brazilian side Palmeiras in February to become FIFA Club World Cup champions for the first time, having defeated fellow English side Manchester City to become European champions last season.  Last week, Abramovich announced that he would sell Chelsea and donate money from the sale to help victims of the war in Ukraine. The government said it had issued a special licence to allow Chelsea to play fixtures and pay staff, but will limit the sale of tickets and merchandise. read more  The entry on the British sanctions list described Abramovich, who Britain said was worth 9 billion pounds, as "a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch who had enjoyed "a close relationship for decades" with Putin.  This association with Putin had brought Abramovich a financial or material benefit from either the Russian president directly, or the Russian government, the listing added.  It said he was "involved in destabilising Ukraine" and undermining its sovereignty and independence via the London-listed Russian steelmaker Evraz (EVRE.L) in which he is the biggest shareholder.  Britain's financial watchdog suspended trading of shares in Evraz, which plummeted 16% after the sanctions were announced.  Evraz has been involved in providing financial services, or funds, goods or technology that could damage Ukraine's independence including providing steel that might be used to make Russian tanks, the British treasury said.  'LONDONGRAD'  London has long been a top destination for Russian money and Johnson has vowed to crack down on those using the British capital as a luxury playground, enjoying upmarket hotels and educating their children at fee-paying schools, earning it the nickname Londongrad because of its popularity with oligarchs.  But Johnson's critics, who point out his Conservative Party has close ties to Russian donors who have donated about 1.9 million pounds since he came to power, say the government has been slow to impose sanctions and asset freezes on Russia oligarchs and those close to Putin's administration.  Opposition lawmakers, who have been demanding action against Abramovich and others, said the news of the sanctions was welcome, but had taken far too long.  "This is the right decision. But it should not have taken the government weeks," David Lammy, the foreign affairs spokesman for the Labour Party said.  "Too few oligarchs linked to Putin’s rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US."

They will announce plans to wean the bloc off Russian energy but markets are keen to hear of any plans for additional fiscal stimulus, possibly financed by another round of joint borrowing.  Then, in the United States, February inflation is predicted at 7.8% year-on-year, surpassing January's four-decade high 7.5%. But since then U.S. gasoline prices have rocketed higher, meaning an above-forecast print may well revive bets of a 50 basis-point interest rate rise at the Federal Reserve's March 15-16 meeting.

REUTERS/Khaled al-Hariri  Summary Iran says U.S. has to drop "unacceptable demands"  Iranian officials say key issues remain unresolved  Russia envoy denies it is holding talks up  Moscow demands guarantees from West on economic trade with Iran  DUBAI/VIENNA, March 10 (Reuters) - Iran raised the stakes in nuclear talks with world powers on Thursday, saying the United States had to drop "unacceptable proposals" just as the prospects of reaching an accord were thrown into uncertainty by last-minute Russian demands.  Eleven months of talks to restore a 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, have reached their final stages. But they stalled last week when Moscow demanded written guarantees from the United States that Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine would not affect its trade with Iran.  Iranian chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani returned to Vienna on Wednesday after holding consultations in Tehran and met the coordinator of the talks, Enrique Mora of the European Union. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Mora had broken off informal meetings on Monday, saying the time had come for political decisions to be taken to end the negotiations.  Several Iranian officials appeared to toughen Tehran's stance on Thursday. After months of remaining silent in the negotiations, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was quoted by Tasnim News Agency as saying Iran would not be naive and bow to pressure to reduce its defensive power, regional presence and progress in nuclear technology. read more  "Regional presence gives us strategic depth and more power. Why should we give it up? Scientific progress in the nuclear field is related to our future needs, and if we give that up, will anyone help us in the future?" he said.  His top security official Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on Twitter accused the United States of not taking the necessary decisions, which was making the talks more complicated.  Four Western diplomats had told Reuters that the broad outline of a deal had been finalised and that there were only minor adjustments to be made. They insisted that Russia was now the main obstacle.  NEW CIRCUMSTANCES  Iranian officials have remained cautious in responding to Russia's demands, but suggested on Thursday that there were still serious unresolved issues in the nuclear negotiations.  Tasnim news agency quoted an Iranian official saying that there were still important matters linked to guarantees and sanctions that had not been resolved.  Iran has also said it wants guarantees that no future U.S. president will again abandon a nuclear deal.  Underscoring Iranian concerns, former U.S. Vice-president Mike Pence said on Wednesday that should Washington agree a new accord and were the Republicans to take power again, they would "rip up any new Iran Nuclear Deal on day one."  An Iranian official said there were still two to three difficult questions to resolve and that Tehran was now also demanding a change in the sequencing of how an accord should be implemented.  He said Iran wanted the issuing of oil waivers first and then Tehran to verify the move by exporting oil and getting petrodollars via the banking system.  European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany have temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could and it was now up to the United States and Iran to agree on outstanding issues.  Russia's envoy to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, on Wednesday evening dismissed any suggestion that Moscow was holding up an agreement and said a text was no longer final because there had been new demands by other participants. read more  "In view of the new circumstances and wave of sanctions against Russia we have the right to protect our interests in the nuclear field and wider context," Ulyanov said.  He said the United States and the European Union had to make it clear that neither now nor in the future could sanctions hit the implementation of nuclear projects in Iran or, much more broadly, Russia's trade and economic relations with Iran.  Western officials say Moscow is trying to reap extra benefits from its participation in the effort to restore the nuclear agreement, but that they would not play ball.

Ukraine Military/Handout via REUTERS  LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday shifted its stance over the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital in the city of Mariupol, with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call to establish clear facts.  Ukrainian's president on Wednesday accused Russia of carrying out genocide after officials said Russian aircraft had bombed the hospital, burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee the besieged city.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked for comment in the immediate aftermath, told Reuters: "Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  On Thursday he said the Kremlin would look into the incident.  "We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don't have clear information about what happened there," Peskov told reporters. "And the military are very likely to provide some information."  Other Russian officials took a more aggressive line on Thursday, rejecting the hospital bombing as fake news.  "This is information terrorism," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.  Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, went further, saying the building that was hit was a former maternity hospital that had been taken over by Ukrainian troops.  "That’s how fake news is born," he said, adding that Russia had warned on March 7 that the hospital had been turned into a military object from which Ukrainians were firing.  The contrasting tone and content of the statements were unusual for Russian officials, who since the start of Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 have maintained tight unity and consistency in their messaging.  Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation to demilitarise and "denazify" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West reject these as false pretexts for an invasion of a democratic country of 44 million people.  On Wednesday, the United States denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims "laughable". read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Additional reporting by Olzhas Auyezov and Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Hugh Lawson  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Sergei Ilnitsky/Pool via REUTERS  Summary No nuclear war I hope, Lavrov says  West keeps coming back to nuclear theme -Lavrov  Russia will never depend on the West again -Lavrov  Russia has markets for its oil and gas  LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday he did not believe the conflict in Ukraine would spiral into a nuclear war but cautioned the United States and Europe that Moscow never again wanted to be dependent on the West.  Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West slapped heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.  Asked by a Kremlin correspondent for Russia's Kommersant newspaper if he thought a nuclear war could be triggered, Lavrov told reporters in Turkey: "I don't want to believe it, and I do not believe it."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the nuclear theme had been thrown into discussions only by the West, which he said kept on returning to nuclear war like Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis.  "Of course it gives us cause for concern when the West, like Freud, keeps on returning and returning to this topic," Lavrov said after talks in Antalya, Turkey with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba.  Lavrov said talk of a potential Russian attack against the former Soviet Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, now all members of the European Union and NATO - "appear to be old hoaxes".  Russia and the United States have by the biggest arsenals of nuclear warheads after the Cold War that divided the world for much of the 20th century, pitting the West against the Soviet Union and its allies.  Putin on Feb. 27 ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be put on high alert, citing Western sanctions and aggressive remarks by leading members of the NATO military alliance. Russian officials later cited British comments about a possible confrontation between NATO and Russia.  GO EAST  Putin says the "special military operation" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the membership of NATO up to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.  Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm.  Now that the West has slapped crippling sanctions on Russia, Lavrov said Russia was turning away from the West and would cope with the economic consequences.  "We'll emerge from this crisis with a revitalised psychology and conscience: We won't have any illusions that the West can be a reliable partner," Lavrov said. "We will do everything to ensure that we never again depend on the West in those areas of our life which have a significant meaning for our people."  When the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, many people in Russia and the West hoped that the divisions of the Cold War were over.  Asked about energy sanctions imposed by the United States, Lavrov said Russia would not try to convince any purchaser to buy its energy.  In a clear reference to China, the world's second largest economy, Lavrov said Russia had markets for its oil and gas.

The West has imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.  "Our economy is experiencing a shock impact now and there are negative consequences, they will be minimised," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.  He described the situation as turbulent, but said that measures to calm and stabilise it were already being taken.  "This is absolutely unprecedented.

Ukraine hopes to start evacuating civilians through seven "humanitarian corridors" on Thursday, a day after it said a children's hospital was hit in a Russian air strike on the southern port city of Mariupol, where thousands are trapped without access to water, medicine or food.  Both sides have blamed the other for the failure of previous evacuation attempts. Russia has dismissed the bombing of the hospital as "fake news". The regional governor said 17 people were wounded. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "We've only seen the beginning, unfortunately, and I think there will be many millions more," European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told Swedish radio.  Authorities and volunteers across central and eastern Europe have spent the past two weeks scrambling to provide food, accommodation and medical aid to the many thousands of refugees pouring across their borders.  "We're getting ready for refugees from the war zones," said Witold Wolczyk from the mayor's office in Przemysl, a town just west of Poland's Medyka border crossing, which has become a major transit hub for refugees.  "We have psychologists on the spot. They have not been that busy so far. If it turns out we need more professionals to help traumatised people, we will look for them."  The Polish Border Guard said on Thursday that 1.43 million people had entered the country from Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24. President Vladimir Putin has said his "special military operation" aims to "de-nazify" Ukraine, a position rejected by the West as baseless propaganda.  Nearly 350,000 people have crossed into Romania from Ukraine while well over 150,000 have reached Slovakia and Hungary, local statistics showed.  Nadezda, a 48-year-old woman from the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv who declined to give her surname, crossed into Poland on foot with her two daughters on Thursday.  "We will try to settle somehow, see what's available and try to live," she said as she came away from the Medyka crossing, hobbled by a broken heel and clutching two small bags.  Refugees' hopes of being able to return home one day have been fading with each day of the invasion. "Kharkiv is gone, half of the city has been destroyed, there's nothing to come back to," Nadezda said.  Authorities and NGOs in Poland have expressed concerns that vulnerable refugees could fall victim to crime, including passports theft or attempts to force them into begging, stealing or prostitution, and have set up a 24/7 helpline advertised on posters at refugee reception centres.  Irena Dawid-Olczyk, who heads the Warsaw-based NGO La Strada which fights human trafficking, said prevention was key.  "So far there are no confirmed cases of human trafficking. But we do expect that in a month or so, bad things will be happening and dishonest employers will try to use the situation," she told Reuters.  "I'm not afraid that people will suffer here, but rather that people will be moved on to Western Europe. We are in crisis, so an orphanage in sunny Spain may sound good, but it may be a trap."

Softened:  - U.S. sanctions were lifted against Rusal and its parent company En+ in 2019 when Deripaska reduced his stakes below a majority threshold to 44.95%. There are still concerns, however, that the Russian oligarch is pulling the strings of his business empire behind the scenes.  Sailing away:  - Deripaska's $65 million yacht Clio is one of several vessels owned by billionaires anchored in the Maldives, which does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S., according to shipping database MarineTraffic.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Summary  Summary Companies Funds with ESG focus totalled $35 trillion in 2020  Crimea response a 'big blunder' for ESG funds -PFA  Attention starting to turn to investments in China  LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - For funds undeterred in their investment choices by the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi or China's treatment of the Uyghurs, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is proving a wake-up call.  Buying into companies on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is one of the hottest trends in the fund management industry, attracting investments totalling more than $35 trillion by the start of 2020.  But for money managers from Boston to London the focus has largely been on companies, with governance risk largely ignored in decisions over whether to invest in a country itself.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  China has denied allegations of abuses against the Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. Saudi Arabia's government has said Khashoggi's killing was committed by a rogue group.  Now, as western banks and companies revisit hundreds of billions of dollars worth of exposure to Russia, more than half a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters said the Ukraine crisis was causing them to rethink how they assign country risk.  "We have to accept that we, as an industry, committed a very big blunder by not taking that invasion (of Crimea) in 2014 for what it was and acting accordingly," said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish $87 billion pension investor PFA.  "Is this something that we would like to repeat?" Beslik said of investors who have been left holding often distressed Russian assets since its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a "special operation" to disarm the country.  While a fund may make its own assessment of the quality and structure of a country's government, this is only one of many factors for investment decisions.  For some 71% of the $35 trillion invested with an ESG focus, the analysis focuses on the risk of an investment, rather than a country's human rights record or other governance factors.  It can be easier to ignore human rights if an ESG fund manager feels the chances of losing money on an asset, such as a sovereign bond, is sufficiently low given its price, because for example the relevant country's ruling government is secure.  Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said for investment decisions on China at least western investors are more focused on shareholder value than on human rights.  However, engagement on sovereign risk is the next frontier for investors, said Martina Macpherson, president of Network for Sustainable Financial Markets, a non-profit organisation which is run by finance and academic experts.  This is particularly the case "where systemic ESG risks such as climate, biodiversity, human rights violations and poor state governance are concerned," Macpherson added.  Government clampdowns can sometimes be followed by more investment flowing into the country concerned as disruptions to daily economic activity cease, as was seen after China brought pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong two years ago to a halt.  Foreign direct investment into China rose 14.9% in 2021.  Beijing rarely discusses the issue of democracy, but has previously referred to China's governance arrangements as "whole-process people's democracy". read more  RISK REWARD  Bets on such market moves have not always been safe ones.  International investors, for example, were criticised last year for holding bonds issued by Belarus when its President Alexander Lukashenko intensified a crackdown on protesters.  And investors in a range of Chinese companies, from technology to property developers, suffered losses as Beijing unleashed a regulatory crackdown last year. read more  While some funds dumped investments in such countries, citing reputational and moral concerns as well as the risk of losses, these have tended to be smaller ones or those with a mandate to invest towards a sustainable outcome.  Most have stayed, not least because the task of exiting becomes tougher the bigger the market.  The BlackRock iShares ESG Aware MSCI EM ETF (ESGE.O) fund, for example, has around 3% invested in Russia, but 28% in China, Refinitiv data shows.  "It's too big to ignore and it's too profitable," Lardy said of investor holdings in China.  This view is echoed by Ross Gerber, president of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who said China's huge global economic reach makes it hard for any investor to avoid.  "There's no way around China," said Gerber, who owns shares in Tesla, for instance, with a big factory in Shanghai.  "People criticise me for having investments in China and not Russia, but it's very nuanced, the people criticising are typing on a Chinese-made iPhone and wearing Chinese-made clothing."  Nevertheless, some are now moving money out of China.  Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it had excluded China's Li Ning (2331.HK) due to an "unacceptable risk" that the sportswear maker was contributing to serious human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China. read more  Li Ning did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday after the Norges Bank announcement.  SOVEREIGN RISK  One major factor missing from ESG calculations is the market pricing of sovereign debt, said Diliana Deltcheva, head of Emerging Market Debt at asset manager Candriam's SRI Bond EM Fund, which has long excluded Russian, Belarussian, Chinese and debt from the Gulf states.  In the case of Russia, foreigners hold nearly $80 billion of debt, including sovereign bonds denominated in roubles, euros and dollars, as well as hard currency corporate securities, while investors outside Russia also owned 86% of Russia's stock market free float at the end of 2021.  In addition, Western companies, from BP and Societe Generale to Citigroup and Apple, built out ties to Russia. Many have paused or ended those connections since the invasion, steps some say show ESG values have now seeped from money management into corporate decision-making. read more  "There are no rules that will protect you," Sonia Kowal, president of U.S.-based ESG investor Zevin Asset Management, said of investing in some countries. Kowal said she avoids investments in Russia and in state-controlled Chinese firms.  Jeffrey Gitterman, an ESG-focused wealth manager in New Jersey, said he sold his firm's 5% emerging-market stake last week after Russia's invasion, worried among other things that China holdings could also face restrictions.  "Everything we know about the role of EM (emerging markets) in portfolios is now subject to re-evaluation," he added.

REUTERS/Christopher Pike  DUBAI, March 10 (Reuters) - Rich Russians are trying to shift some of their wealth from Europe to Dubai to shield assets from a tightening wave of Western sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, financial and legal sources said.  Dubai, the Gulf's freewheeling financial and business hub, has long been a magnet for the globe's ultra-rich and the United Arab Emirates' refusal to take sides between Western allies and Moscow has signalled to Russians that their money is safe there.  The UAE, which over the years has deepened its ties with Russia, has not matched sanctions imposed by Western nations and its central bank has so far not issued guidance regarding Western sanctions.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In many cases, wealthy Russians are seeking to shift funds to Dubai that are now in Switzerland or London - which have both sanctioned Russian individuals and organisations, a senior banker at a large Swiss private bank and a lawyer familiar with the matter said.  The lawyer, who is based in Dubai, said his firm had received inquiries from Russian entities on how quickly they could move "very significant funds" worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Gulf Arab state.  "The UAE is a nice medium - a few hours away by flight and doesn't have a regulator completely in cahoots with Western regulators," an investment management professional said.  The Dubai Media Office, UAE foreign ministry and central bank did not immediately respond to a query about the scale of Russian funds flowing into Dubai.  The senior private banker said in some cases, Russian clients with accounts at private banks were opening accounts with that same bank's UAE branch. Others were opening accounts with local banks, the banker added.  Russians, facing a crumbling economy at home, are also looking to put their money in investments including real estate and buying into funds which do not disclose ownership information, another financial source said.  Dubai, a global tourism destination, has long been popular with Russians, who were among the top visitors to the emirate and purchasers of real estate even before the war and ensuing sanctions threw its economy into turmoil and its currency tumbled to record lows. read more  The UAE in 2018 introduced a "golden" visa program - which grants 10-year residency - to investors and other professionals.  BANKS CAUTIOUS  The UAE's decision to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote condemning the invasion, coupled with Gulf sovereign wealth funds maintaining their exposure to Russia, was taken as reassurance to wealthy Russians, the sources said.  There is no indication that the Russian wealth flowing to Dubai is subject to Western sanctions. However, bankers said there was a risk of reputational harm to institutions receiving Russian funds as multinationals around the world cut ties with Moscow.  Some major UAE banks are taking a cautious approach. Banks operating in the Gulf state have in the past been penalised for non-compliance with sanctions on countries including Iran and Sudan.  And global financial crime watchdog The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last week put the UAE on a "grey list" of jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring. read more  "Being on the grey list, they (UAE) probably have to be more careful than normal. Now, the last thing they want is for Europe to use this as a further reason to keep them on this list," the lawyer said.  The Dubai Media Office, UAE foreign ministry and central bank did not immediately respond to questions regarding guidance to banks and businesses on how to comply with sanctions on Russia, or on what protocols are in place should other countries request the seizure of any sanctioned assets, should they be in the UAE.  Two sources familiar with the matter said businesses in the UAE would spend more time looking into the origins of their funds through a so-called Know-Your-Customer process.  WEALTH MANAGEMENT  A source at a Dubai bank said that funds from Russians are not being accepted for wealth management, though they could set up deposit accounts.  "In principle, they can do it," but the bank has high compliance hurdles to clear internally to accept Russian money, including evidence of where it came from, the source said.  The UAE's nascent private wealth industry has not yet reached the scale or sophistication to fully absorb wealth stored in Switzerland and other traditional money shelters, sources said.  "They might take some, but I find it hard to imagine that they would take it all," the investment management professional said. "It's not just the servicing element, but the investment management which most of these banks lack.

Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling Ukraine’s government in Kyiv, Russia has control of only one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson. During the first week of war, Russia shifted from 1 strategic strikes against military targets using cruise missiles to a 2 stalled ground attack and, currently, a broader 3 siege of major cities, including bombardments using rocket artillery and cluster munitions, sometimes against residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. Moscow denies targeting civilians, and calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm its neighbour and remove leaders it considers dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and Western allies call it an unprovoked invasion that has killed hundreds of civilians. As the invasion heads into its third week, hundreds of thousands of people in Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, have been surrounded and under heavy bombardment, with no water or power or way to safely evacuate the wounded, officials there say. In Kharkiv and Kyiv, missiles hit residential buildings. Millions of Ukrainians have already fled the country as refugees.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko  1 Targeted missile attacks During the initial hours of the invasion, cruise missiles were widely deployed, and precision short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) were fired en masse in a war for the first time. According to U.S. estimates, the first Russian onslaught included more than 100 missiles launched from land and sea.  Russia most likely used its only SRBM in active service, the Iskander-M, said Timothy Wright, a research analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Ukraine has a limited supply of much older ballistic missiles, the OTR-21 Tochka, and in the first days of the war used at least one to attack a Russian air base inside Russia, according to media reports.  According to the IISS, the Iskander-M has greater range than the Tochka and its launchers can carry more than one missile. Each Iskander launcher has an armoured cover for the missiles, and its cabin is hardened against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards, as well as extreme temperatures. The vehicle can drive off-road and can travel at speeds up to 70 km/h (43 mph) for 1,100 km (684 miles). The Iskander-M has circular error probable (CEP) of 5-7 metres, meaning half of the projectiles fired will land in a circle with a radius of that size. The Tochka, by contrast, has a CEP of 90m.  On Friday, Feb. 25, Ukraine's military command said areas near the cities of Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol were hit by Russian 3M14 Kalibr cruise missiles launched at the country from the Black Sea. The Kalibr is a land-attack cruise missile (LACM) with an estimated range of 1,500 to 2,500 km. Meant for precision strikes, its exact CEP is unknown but is estimated to be less than 5m.  Some Russian strikes at air bases appeared relatively limited, however, and in instances missed vital targets, such as hitting stored rather than operational aircraft, said Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at IISS. Ukraine has the Cold War-era Russian-made S-300v anti-aircraft missile system, which also has anti-ballistic missile capabilities, Wright said. It is unclear whether any engaged the Russian missiles, and some S-300v vehicles appeared to have been destroyed by strikes, he added.  As Moscow failed to swiftly overthrow Ukraine's government in the first days of the attack, the results of its missile campaign appear to have been mixed at best. Although vastly outmatched by Russian airpower in terms of size, Ukraine’s air force is still operating, and experts say its air defences remain viable - a fact that has baffled some military analysts.  2 Stalled ground war In the two main fronts in the east and north, Russia so far has little to show for its advance, with Ukraine's two biggest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, holding out in the face of increasingly intense bombardment. Ukrainian civilians are supporting regular troops as they try to repel Russia's advance, including through civil defence units and independent militia that have formed across the country.  A video shows workers making anti-tank barriers and cars driving around Jersey barriers and obstacles in streets.  Russian forces are becoming increasingly frustrated by what the United States believes is a viable and very determined Ukrainian resistance even as Moscow has committed almost all of the forces set aside for the invasion, U.S. defence officials said this week.

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich  The United States and European nations have supplied Ukraine with a variety of hardware, including advanced weapons that can destroy armoured vehicles. These missiles can be particularly effective in urban settings, with more opportunities for teams to conceal themselves for ambushes. Among these weapons are the NLAW, the next-generation antitank missile system developed jointly between UK and Sweden, and the FGM-148 Javelin, a U.S. lightweight system that can destroy tanks from several kilometers away.  Photos from Ukraine have shown abandoned Russian vehicles, including tanks, raising questions about logistical failures alongside Ukranian attacks. "They simply don't have a lot of experience moving on another nation state at this level of complexity and size," a senior U.S. defence official said of the Russian army. The official said it was unclear whether it was a failure in planning or execution, but added that Russian forces were likely to adapt and change the way they operate.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko  Another tool that has become important for Ukrainians in their fight is the Bayraktar TB2 unmanned combat aerial vehicle - a Turkish-made drone that can carry small anti-armor weapons. Ukraine's ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodnar, has said the drones had been very efficient; videos posted by Ukraine’s military showed them being used to destroy vehicles in Russian convoys. Turkey has sold Kyiv several batches of TB2 drones, which it had deployed against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The drone can carry small anti-vehicle weapons, most likely the Roketsan MAM-L “smart micro munition,” which follows a laser to its targets and can glide up to 8 km before impact, according to its manufacturer. The bombs weigh only 22kg but are designed to use a small charge to punch through armor and destroy a vehicle.  3 Siege tactics Russia has shifted its strategy from directly attacking Ukrainian defences to siege warfare in recent days. Russian forces warned Kyiv residents to flee their homes last week before bombarding the city and rained rockets down on Kharkiv, flattening homes and other civilian infrastructure. Kharkiv region head Oleg Synegubov has said Russian missile attacks had hit the centre of Ukraine's second-largest city, including residential areas and the regional administration building. The Mariupol city council said Russian forces were constantly and deliberately shelling vital civilian infrastructure in the southeastern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power and preventing it from bringing in supplies or evacuating people. Cities under siege  Synegubov said his city’s defences were holding. "Such attacks are genocide of the Ukrainian people, a war crime against the civilian population!" he said.  The BM-21 is one of the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) used by the Russian army. One battalion of 18 launchers can deliver 720 rockets in a single volley. The rockets are unguided and have lower precision than typical artillery; they cannot be used in situations that call for pinpoint accuracy. To destroy a target, it relies on a large number of rockets spread across an area.  Siege tactics typically involve encircling enemy positions, cutting off supply and escape routes, then attacking with a combined force of armour, ground troops and engineers. Russian forces have also deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine, worrying Western observers about how broadly they could be used, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Thursday. Thermobaric weapons disperse a cloud of fuel mixture, which is then ignited a moment later to create a powerful explosion. "We've seen the deployment of thermobaric artillery weapon systems and we worry how broad those could go," Wallace said during a visit to Estonia.  Russia says its actions in Ukraine are not meant to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Press service of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERS  What’s next As the siege of major cities continues, the corridors to let civilians escape and allow aid to reach besieged areas have been the main subject of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Ukraine's government accused Russian forces of shelling a humanitarian corridor that Moscow had promised to open to let residents flee Mariupol. The humanitarian situation there was catastrophic, a deputy prime minister said. Russia opened a separate corridor allowing residents out of the eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday, the first successful evacuation under such a safe route. Meanwhile, Poland said Tuesday it was ready to put all its MIG-29 jets at the disposal of the United States, which U.S. lawmakers had pushed to then transfer to the Ukrainians. The move was quickly rejected by Washington. The Pentagon said the prospect of flying combat aircraft from NATO territory into the war zone "raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance." Transferring such aircraft to Ukraine would mean Ukrainians could pilot the planes without additional training. Western allies had reacted coolly to a proposal by Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy for a no-fly zone for Russian flights over Ukraine, saying participation in such a move would be tantamount to a direct conflict with Moscow.

In recent days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, dubbed a "special operation" by Moscow, the town's churches have been packed with locals wracked by feelings of despair and powerlessness, praying for friends and families back in Ukraine.  Meroslawa Krevei, a museum curator of Ukrainian descent, walks along the entrance of the Sagrado Coracao de Jesus Catechist Institute. Civil servant Oksana Jadvizak, 35, first visited Ukraine in 2008 on a scholarship. She was still there in 2014, during the Maidan uprising that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich, now exiled in Russia. One of her professors died in those clashes, and Jadvizak said she was horrified by the recent escalation with Russia that has left Ukraine a smoldering pile of rubble. "It's so impactful to see the tanks of war and planes flying over, and hearing my friends saying they are going to battle," she said in front of a Byzantine church, wearing the Ukrainian soccer jersey, and a yellow-and-blue flag draped around her shoulders. With the sound of a choir rising behind her, Jadvizak had come out to show solidarity with those in Ukraine.  Ukrainian descendants and members of the "Cossack brotherhood" pray the rosary inside the Sao Josafat church. "We're going to pray so that everything ends well," said Jadvizak, who is of fourth generation Ukrainian descent, and counts Portuguese as her second language. Some in the town drew parallels between their own families' exit from Ukraine, and that of the millions of refugees fleeing in the wake of Russia's invasion. Nadia Rurak Techy, 66, a shopkeeper whose parents came to Brazil after living through the "terror" of World War Two, said she feared Ukrainian culture would be erased.  Nadia Rurak Techy holds a photo of her parents. "I'm distraught," she said, breaking into tears at her clothes shop. "Ukraine doesn't deserve this ... Our homeland has to be free. It needs to remain beautiful, as it always was." ECONOMIC MIGRANTS Ukrainian migrants, many from the western Galicia region that includes the city of Lviv, began arriving in Prudentopolis in 1896, according to Anderson Prado, a historian from the Federal University of Parana who has studied the town's roots. He said Ukrainians were fleeing extreme poverty, just a few decades after Tsarist Russia outlawed serfdom.  The Prudentopolis city known as "Little Ukraine”. They found a welcome home in the vast, fertile south of Brazil. The country, which had recently abolished slavery, was desperate for workers to develop its farmland, and actively recruited Europeans through publicity campaigns. The first roughly 1,500 Ukrainian families that arrived worked in agriculture and sawmills, industries that remain major employers to this day, Prado said.  The Nossa Senhora do Patrocinio church. The people of Prudentopolis, named after former Brazilian President Prudente de Morais, have retained surprisingly close ties with Ukraine, Prado said. Over three-quarters of the town's 52,000 people speak some Ukrainian, its official second language. "The descendants who live in Prudentopolis have a fundamental connection with Ukraine," he said. "They are very close to their relatives who stayed there, and the vast majority dream of returning or visiting the land of their origins."  Filomena Procek, 67, an art teacher of Ukrainian descent, watches the news about Ukraine accompanied by family friend, Maria Luiza Burcovski, 17. Dental surgeon Rodrigo Michalovski, 31, agreed. He is part of a decades-old group in the town known as the "Cossack Brotherhood." The club seeks to maintain ties with Ukrainian culture through dances and historical presentations. Almost all members are Catholic and dress up in traditional clothes, keeping their hair and beards in the classic Cossack style. "We learn to love Ukraine from childhood ... and we carry that love for our entire lives," Michalovski said. "Every bit of sad news about the war is a stab in my chest, in my heart. We will only have peace again when the fire in Ukraine stops, when I know that our people are safe."  Rodrigo Michalovski dresses in the typical attire of the "Cossack brotherhood”. With few means to help those in Ukraine, Jadvizak, the civil servant, said she was offering whatever support she could. "Today I sent a message to my friends saying that if they needed, my house is open," she said. "I think everyone here in Prudentopolis, where 70% of the population is of Ukrainian descent, is willing to shelter people." Thiago Zakalugne, 36, a mechanic and fellow member of the "Cossack Brotherhood," echoed the views of many in Prudentopolis, who were at a loss for ways to help. Like them, he was also putting his faith in the divine.  Helena Kachuski, 80, a Ukrainian descendant, and her husband Jose Petel, 81, watch the news on television at home.  Story "Each bomb that falls over there, each drop of Ukrainian blood spilled is a piece of our heart that breaks," he said. "If I could, I would certainly go, to try to help somehow ... but our way of helping from here right now is with prayer."

REUTERS/George Frey/File Photo  March 10 (Reuters) - Victims of America's opioid addiction epidemic will confront in court on Thursday the Sackler family members who own OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma, in an attempt to force them to face their role in a crisis that claimed 500,000 overdose deaths.  The two-hour hearing conducted by Zoom stemmed from a $6 billion settlement between the Sacklers and state attorneys general which could resolve claims over the family's role in the crisis without taking them to trial. read more  The Sacklers will not be able to respond during the hearing.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I think for people who are sharing their stories tomorrow, it will be a relief to be able to express those feelings of sadness and anger they have had to hold inside for a long time and to express them directly to the perpetrators of this epidemic," said Dita Bhargava, whose son died from a fentanyl overdose.  It was unclear who would be chosen to speak but the official committee of creditors in the bankruptcy includes thousands of people who filed personal injury claims against Purdue Pharma.  At least one member will attend from the family of the late Raymond Sackler and one from the family of the late Mortimer Sackler, two of the three brothers, all doctors, who purchased Purdue's predecessor in 1952.  Sackler family members did not respond to requests for comment.  Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing. They said last week in a statement that they "sincerely regret" that OxyContin "unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis."  Richard Sackler told the bankruptcy court in August that the family did not bear responsibility for the crisis. At the same hearing, his son David Sackler testified that the family has a "moral responsibility" to help curb the opioid epidemic.  Both served as Purdue board members along with several other members of the family and have been named in lawsuits alleging they directed deceptive marketing of addictive painkillers.  Purdue Pharma filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 and the court extended to the Sacklers legal protections from being sued, one of the main benefits of seeking bankruptcy, despite the family members never filing for bankruptcy.  That controversial protection is being challenged in court by the U.S. Department of Justice.  The $6 billion legal settlement also requires millions of pages of internal company documents be made public.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/  WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - The gusher of money the U.S. government poured into family bank accounts during the coronavirus pandemic, credited with speeding the rebound from the health crisis, may now help limit the economic damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  As analysts have begun parsing what sky-high oil prices and new uncertainty might mean, a common theme has emerged: U.S. consumers may get gouged at the gas pump but will likely be able to maintain much of their expected spending on other goods and services because of the savings accumulated during the last two years thanks to emergency federal programs totaling about $5 trillion since the spring of 2020.  The war in Ukraine is a shock, they note, but one the United States may have unintentionally insured itself against.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Household savings could help consumers maintain spending volumes in the face of related price increases," JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver wrote this week, noting that each 10% increase in oil prices would cost consumers an additional $23 billion each year.  Households "have accumulated about $2.6 trillion of 'excess saving' in recent years relative to the pre-pandemic trend, which all else equal could be enough to cover even a sustained 50% surge in oil and natural gas prices for many years to come."  U.S. consumer price data due to be released later on Thursday is expected to show the pace of annual price increases jumped to 7.9% last month from 7.5% in January. Even that won't reflect the brunt of commodity price increases in the two weeks since Russia invaded its neighbor.  The full effect will depend on how long the war lasts, how deeply commodity markets are disrupted, and how forcefully the Federal Reserve responds to inflation that was accelerating for reasons beyond oil prices.  The United States and its Western allies responded to the Feb. 24 invasion by imposing punishing sanctions on Russia, the world's largest exporter of oil and oil products combined, adding to the updraft in oil prices. The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude briefly hit $130 a barrel, from around $92 before the conflict, and ended at around $110 on Wednesday.  The average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline has hit a record $4.25 a gallon, though that is about $1 a gallon below the inflation-adjusted peak.  While that indicates inflation likely has further to climb, it's less clear what it will mean both for the Fed, as it debates how fast to raise interest rates, and for the U.S. economy as it emerges from the pandemic.  Some prior oil shocks, such as the one in the 1970s, were associated with more persistent inflation that prompted the U.S. central bank to react with aggressive rate increases. Others, such as the brief spike during the Gulf War in the early 1990s, came alongside Fed rate cuts because underlying inflation was expected to ease.  SIGNS OF SUBSTITUTION, NOT PULLBACK  The U.S. economy may have some room to give. Growth entering the year was strong, and even if high oil prices slow things, the outcome for the year is still likely to be solid - not the weak growth and rising prices of a true "stagflation."  "The U.S. has become less sensitive to energy shocks," with a steady decline in the share of income spent on energy, Bank of America economists wrote in a note. "With Omicron cases fading, the reopening of the service sector has resumed ... Excess savings built up over the last two years can fund this rebound."  Reuters Graphics  Research on past oil shocks offers a sense of what to expect. Even as gas prices rise, fuel consumption and driving tend to remain steady, partly out of necessity - the daily commute, driving on the job, or family chores - as well as choice.  Household budgets then adapt. One 2008 study of periods when gas prices were high found increased bargain shopping at grocery stores and substitution into cheaper brands.  One possible bellwether of such a move: Shares of discount retail chain Dollar General Corp (DG.N) have risen about 10% since the Ukraine war began, outpacing the broader market.  Nik Modi, a tobacco and household products analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said there was already evidence in late February before the invasion that smokers were trading down to cheaper cigarettes, a trend he expects to continue as gas prices rise. Pump prices had risen nearly 30 cents a gallon from the start of the year to when Russia invaded. They're up another 70 cents since.  Yet high frequency restaurant and travel data so far shows little evidence of consumers pulling back.  PANDEMIC BEHAVIOR CHANGES  Corporate officials who might otherwise expect fallout from higher gas prices said they were hopeful consumer spending will hold up.  Some studies have found rising gas prices cause families to at least delay larger purchases, but "the effect of that might be somewhat more muted in this environment than maybe it has historically," David Denton, the chief financial officer of home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc's (LOW.N), said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail conference on Wednesday.  "In the past, when gas prices have gone up, demand in this sector has kind of gone down a little bit," Denton said, but working from home in particular may have insulated consumers who previously commuted to work.  Other pandemic dynamics may also play out. Public transit use remains depressed but could be an acceptable option for former riders as COVID-19 infections decrease. Credit card balances are lower, giving financial space to consumers intent on spending now that social life has resumed more fully.  In addition, economists and officials have noted that higher oil prices now have some potential upside in the United States, with the hit to consumers offset by rising employment and investment in domestic energy production.  "Oil prices would need to rise much further from here to seriously threaten the consumer recovery," wrote Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "For the broader economy, any hit to consumption should be mostly offset by greater investment in shale production."  Pearce said there may even be some unintended benefits for the Fed. If rising gas prices do curb consumer demand for some goods and services, it could ease inflation by bringing demand closer in line with available supply.  Rate hikes in part work by discouraging consumption, and the oil shock may accomplish some of that job for the Fed, which is widely expected to raise borrowing costs at the end of its policy meeting next week.  "To the extent this means domestic demand is weaker, we should be seeing less upward pressure on wages and services prices," Pearce said.

Gathering in France's opulent Versailles palace, the 27 national EU leaders will also look at shoring up their defences and economies. But they are set to disappoint Ukraine's dramatic appeal for quick membership as it battles Russian invasion.  "It will take time," French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune told France Inter radio, adding that Ukraine's accession to the EU was "not for tomorrow".  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Russia's Feb. 24 military invasion shattered Europe's security order that emerged from the ashes of World War Two and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said Europe was facing its Sept. 11 moment, a reference to the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States that triggered a Washington-led invasion of Afghanistan and years of a so-called international "war on terror".  "We are not taking part but it is on our doorstep," de Croo told the Le Soir daily, referring to Russia's assault on Ukraine. "September 11 was a decisive moment in the United States. This war in Ukraine is Europe's 9/11."  The EU has slapped sanctions of unprecedented severity on Russia for invading its neighbour, including cutting seven Russian banks from the SWIFT transaction system, targeting Moscow ally Belarus and blacklisting Russian state officials and billionaire oligarchs close to the Kremlin.  'TECTONIC SHIFT'  "Russia's war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history," EU leaders were expected to say in a joint statement, adding the invasion confronted them with "growing instability, strategic competition and security threats".  The EU still pays hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars every day to Russia, its biggest energy supplier, for more than 40% of its natural gas, more than a quarter of oil imports and almost half of its coal.  While the United States has already cut Russian oil imports, the case for the EU is more complicated, expensive and politically sensitive as it fears further big jumps in energy and food prices.  EU leaders disagree on a deadline for jettisoning Russian energy sources because national dependency differs, with Germany, Italy, Hungary, Austria the most exposed. read more  Russia hawks in the EU including Poland and Lithuania - both once under Soviet domination from Moscow - want to punish Putin harder and say the West should be ready to bear the price of retaliation. But Germany, France and some western EU states want to keep on doing business.  EU nations are just as split on letting Ukraine join their affluent union, with France and the Netherlands leading the reluctant camp against a group of strong supporters including Poland and other eastern EU neighbours of Ukraine.  Both sanctions and enlargement - a process that normally takes years to satisfy strict criteria ranging from economic stability to rooting out corruption to respecting liberal human rights - require unanimity in the EU.  Ukraine is a former Soviet republic that now wants to join the EU and NATO. That is anathema to Moscow where Putin launched what he calls a "special military operation" to derail Ukraine's drive for deeper integration with Western democracies.  Russian forces have bombarded Ukrainian cities and sent two million refugees fleeing into the EU. Kyiv has appealed for more Western help beyond economic sanctions and some arms supplies.  But, wary of the economic hit as well as being dragged directly into the war, the EU is more likely to offer words of moral support to Ukraine as it looks inwards to get ready for years of worsening confrontation with Russia.

Roni Rekomaa/Lehtikuva/via REUTERS  STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Reuters) - Sweden's defence needs to be increased significantly as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen the security situation in Europe deteriorate, the government said on Thursday, vowing to raise military spending to 2% of GDP as soon as possible.  "Today, we present a new initiative with a clear message to the Swedish people and to the world around us. Sweden's defence capability must be greatly strengthened," Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference.  Sweden's military spending has increased in recent years following decades of cuts after the Cold War ended. The budget this year is 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 0.9% in 2015, but far from around 3% in the early 1980s.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Finance Minister Mikael Damberg told the news conference that this year's budget of about 70 billion Swedish crowns ($7.18 billion) was 42 billion short of 2% of GDP.  Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation" to demilitarize Ukraine.  NATO, which Sweden is not a member of but has close cooperation with, has a requirement of 2% defence spending for its members.  Sweden has long history of neutrality and remaining outside military alliances but the war in Ukraine has shifted public opinion in favour of NATO membership. read more  Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said it was too early to say how long it would take to get to 2% and that it depended on several factors, including how fast the armed forces could grow.  "We want to implement this in a systematic, realistic and feasible way. We must get the most out of every crown we spend on defense," he said.  Hultqvist also said Sweden would increase security cooperation with several partners, including NATO, but also bilaterally with Finland, Britain and the United States. read more  ($1 = 9.7509 Swedish crowns)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Johan Ahlander, Editing by Helena Soderpalm, Robert Birsel  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

European stocks fell 1.7%, with indexes in Germany (.GDAXI) and Britain (.FTSE) losing 1.9% and 0.9% respectively, a reversal after futures gauges had suggested slim gains in early trade. Automakers (.SXEP) suffered the most, falling 0.9%.

Analysts said the gains in Asia, which came after European stocks had their best day in almost two years on Wednesday, were always susceptible to a sharp reversal.  "The prospect of peace, an imminent de-escalation, really is pie in the sky," said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.  "As with any sort of bear market you always get face-ripping rallies in them, because people are reluctant to be aggressively pessimistic."

REUTERS/David Gray  Summary  Summary Companies Wheat exports hampered by truck, port limits  Coal producers at full tilt have no extra volume  LNG exports head for decline as ageing fields dry up  MELBOURNE/WELLINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Phones are ringing off the hook in Australia as buyers hunt for supplies of coal, gas and wheat to replace cargoes from Russia and war-torn Ukraine, but local producers are being hampered by infrastructural and labour constraints.  With shipping disrupted out of the Black Sea and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil as well as sanctions on Russian banks hitting trade finance, supply shortages are looming for coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) globally.  Wheat, coal and LNG prices have soared to record highs as Russia and Ukraine together account for about 30% of the world's wheat trade, while Russia is the world's third-largest exporter of coal used in power generation, and fourth-largest exporter of LNG.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Australian commodity exporters eye up profitable trade potential as global prices spike  In wheat, as the world's sixth largest exporter, Australia is set to ship a record 25.3 million tonnes this year, but trucking, rail, port and staffing constraints mean it won't be able to fill supply gaps at least in the near term.  All the shipping slots are booked up for the next few months on the east and west coast, following a second straight year of a record wheat crop, which has kept a lid on Australian wheat prices compared to the Chicago Board of Trade prices.  "We simply can't get as much out of the country in time to benefit from the global prices at the moment," said Rabobank agricultural analyst Dennis Voznesenski.  He said Asian buyers who typically only place orders a month or two in advance are already tapping Australia merchants for grain in June and July, when they would typically rely on supplies from the Black Sea.  "Everyone's pretty much scrambling now," said Graeme Cooney, founder of Mobile Conveying Services, which operates mobile ship loaders for the grains and coal industries.  His company is facing calls from wheat growers and coal miners who need loaders to get their products to port and onto ships as fast as possible, but there is a shortage of equipment to do the job.  Amid a global shipping crunch, the lead times for acquiring loaders from overseas has blown out to 12 or 13 months.  "So, yes, there is a bottleneck now," Cooney said.  Trucking company Riordan Grains said even if it were to buy more trucks to handle the bumper crop, there are no drivers available.  "We all know that unemployment is at record lows, so trying to find additional people to do additional work in Australia, even if we had more ports, is pretty much impossible," Managing Director Jim Riordan said.  CONTRACTS BOOKED  Coal producers, too, have been bombarded with calls for supply over the past two weeks from countries like Poland which have been reliant on Russian supply.  "New Hope Group's high quality coals are in high demand in existing markets, however, we are examining opportunities to supply European markets," a New Hope Corp (NHC.AX) spokesperson said.  Australia export volumes & value of coal, LNG, wheat and nickel  However Australia's coal and LNG producers sell most of their volumes in term contracts, so cannot divert supplies from those customers.  "Australian miners are running flat out. We should see a slight uptick in coal production and exports once the wet weather up and down the east coast of Australia subsides," said Barrenjoey analyst Glyn Lawcock.  While they won't be able to hike output, coal producers will be able to reap the benefits of soaring prices.  In its December quarterly outlook, ahead of the Ukraine conflict, the government forecast Australia's thermal coal exports would rise to 208 million tonnes in the year to June 2022 from 192 million tonnes a year earlier, but the value would more than double to A$35 billion ($26 billion).  For LNG producers, there is no extra gas available to be able to boost output. In fact, LNG exports are expected to be flat or lower versus last year's record 80.6 million tonnes, which ranked Australia as the world's largest LNG exporter.  Production at the country's two oldest LNG projects, North West Shelf LNG and Darwin LNG, is falling as their founding gas fields dry up.  At the same time, the Prelude floating LNG plant, run by Shell (SHEL.L), is off line, following a massive power failure in December, and the company has not given a time frame for restarting the 3.6 million tonnes a year facility.  Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX), operator of two of Australia's LNG plants, said it expects most of its uncommitted cargoes to be sold in Asia, as the Asia-Pacific market is short of product.  Thanks to soaring oil-linked contract prices, the value of Australia's LNG exports in the year to June 2022 is expected to more than double to A$63 billion from the previous year, according to the government's December forecast.  Value of Australian coal, LNG, wheat and nickel exports since 2005  Nickel could be a stand out, on the back of an unprecedented surge in prices. Australia's exports are forecast to jump by 42% to 257,000 tonnes in the year to June 2022 from a year earlier, valued at A$5.2 billion.

REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee  NEW DELHI, March 10 (Reuters) - An upstart political party that rules India's capital has swept an election in Punjab state, a Thursday vote-count showed, bolstering its hopes of becoming the main challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, was leading in 91 out of 117 seats in the northern state and looked set to beat the state's incumbent Congress party, the BJP and a regional party by a wide margin, according to Election Commission data.  "Now there will be a national alternative to the BJP and Congress," the party's spokesman, Saurabh Bharadwaj, told Reuters.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The party - its name in Hindi means "common man" - emerged in 2012 out of an anti-corruption movement and soon went on to win power in the capital, home to 20 million people.  Its appeal stems from Kejriwal's reputation as a incorruptible leader with a track record of delivering public services, analysts say.  "He's got a super clean image and he is seen as having done a very good job in Delhi," Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research think-tank, said of the 53-year-old former bureaucrat.  Modi and his party are looking strong in the run-up to India's next general election, due by 2024. The BJP has deep pockets, formidable electoral machinery and its Hindu nationalist agenda is a proven vote-winner.  Opposition to Modi has failed to coalesce around the Congress party, which ruled India for decades but has been unable to stem a slide in its popularity over recent years.  That raises the possibility that the AAP could grow and breathe new life into an anti-Modi bloc, said Sircar.  "Over time, it's hard not to see Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party emerge as a serious opposition," he said.  'DELHI MODEL'  The AAP would now focus on building support in the northern states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, and the western state of Gujarat, Modi's home state, to show voters the BJP was not their only choice, said Bharadwaj.  "In national politics, the BJP survives on the fact that there is no national alternative - the only alternative that is suggested is Congress, which is a weak alternative," he said.  Aman Arora, a lawmaker in Punjab who was inspired by Kejriwal to join the party in 2016, said voters in the breadbasket state of more than 27 million people had been won over by the AAP's performance in Delhi and the party had to build on that.  "Our biggest strength and driving force is the governance model of the last five years in Delhi," said Arora, pointing especially to improvements in education and health that the AAP has show-cased as the "Delhi model".  Bharadwaj acknowledged that taking on the BJP was a big challenge but he said he had faith his party could use Punjab to show the rest of India just what it could do.  "We cannot compete with the BJP in terms of resources," he said.  "But when we start performing in Punjab, there will be many reasons for people to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party."

AAP Image/Bianca De Marchi via REUTERS  SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - Thousands of Australians returned to their homes on Thursday after torrential rains eased and floodwaters receded as authorities ramped up clean-up efforts and unveiled new support packages for residents who lost their homes.  Relentless rains since late last month burst river banks across Australia's southeast, submerging homes, farms and bridges, and cutting off entire towns. Twenty-one people have been killed so far.  "We know it has been a devastating time up here, probably moving through the initial shock for many people and the trauma that is associated with that," New South Wales state Premier Dominic Perrottet said from the worst-hit Northern Rivers area.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Many people are now coming back to their homes in very difficult conditions, many are not habitable," Perrottet said as he unveiled a A$551 million ($403 million) aid package for flood-hit residents providing up to 16 weeks of rental support.  More than 1,200 people remained in emergency accommodation in the Northern Rivers region while around 3,000 homes were deemed uninhabitable, authorities said.  Rescue teams, including defence force personnel, took advantage of eased conditions to clear debris and deliver essential supplies but anger swelled among many residents, with no access to power and internet for several days.  Amid criticism over slow relief, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, behind in polls in an election year, on Wednesday declared the floods a national emergency and designated catastrophe zones in flood-stricken towns. read more  A Climate Council of Australia report published on Thursday described the recent flood events as one of the most extreme disasters in Australian history and said the devastation was "wide ranging". Total damages have been estimated at A$1.77 billion ($1.30 billion), the Insurance Council of Australia said.  Meanwhile, skies cleared in Sydney after nearly two weeks but major flooding continued in the city's western suburbs of North Richmond and Windsor as water continued to flow from overloaded dams and rivers. Floodwaters could continue at the current levels over the next 24 hours, emergency services said.

Most prices were down on profit taking and correcting after a sharp rise earlier in the week, traders said.  Analysts at Engie EnergyScan said factors such as more European nations asking for a temporary energy price cap, the first signs of demand destruction with Yara cutting ammonia output, the continuation of Russian gas flows and profit taking were all bearish.  Norway's Yara, one of the world's largest fertiliser makers, is curtailing its ammonia and urea output in Italy and France due to the surge in natural gas prices, it said on Wednesday.  "However, any escalation in Ukraine/Russia conflict will reflect on soaring UK gas price, which remains to be the major bullish risk," said Refinitiv gas analysts.  The head of Ukraine’s gas transit operator said on Thursday there was a danger to gas transit flows to Europe because of the presence of Russian troops on the territory of gas compressor stations in Ukraine. read more  The operator did not say how many stations were affected or where they were.

REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko  Summary SA eyes maize export markets for bumper crop  No wheat imported from Russia and Ukraine this year  March 8 (Reuters) - South Africa will feel the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on food prices but is also primed to benefit from it through maize exports, experts said on Tuesday.  Commodity prices, including wheat and corn, have surged since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia and Ukraine account for about 29% and 19% of global wheat and maize exports, respectively.  With Ukraine's ports closed and much of Russian grain supply frozen by Western sanctions, there are fears tightening supplies will lead to shortages in importing countries.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  South Africa, a net exporter of maize, another name for corn, imports about 40% of its wheat, but Agriculture Business Chamber Chief Economist Wandile Sihlobo said shortages were unlikely.  "In South Africa, the near-term impact of this war is through price transmission and not the limitation on the commodities' availability," Sihlobo said in a weekly note.  Last year, the country harvested 16.315 million tonnes of maize, its second-biggest crop on record. Official data released last week forecasts an 11% decline in output this year, but the projected 14.528 million tonnes is still in excess of domestic consumption.  For wheat, data from Grain SA shows South Africa had imported 40% of its import requirements by Feb. 25 and none of it came from Russia or Ukraine.  South Africa imported wheat from Lithuania, Argentina, Poland, Australia, Latvia and the United States.  "The conflict has an impact on the international wheat prices which ultimately reflect in the SA wheat prices as well," Grain SA economist Luan van der Walt told Reuters in an emailed response.  He said South Africa could benefit from maize exports if supplies from Ukraine remain curtailed.  "In many cases, SA has to compete with especially Ukraine in terms of maize exports. Therefore, it could present even more maize export opportunities for SA," van der Walt said.

Booker finished with 23 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, while Phoenix also got 21 points from Mikal Bridges and 19 points and 10 rebounds from Deandre Ayton. JaVale McGee added 11 points and a season-high 15 rebounds off the bench.  The game was a matchup between the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference (Miami) and the squad that leads the Western Conference (Phoenix).

Kyle Lowry added five points and a game-high 10 assists.  Raptors 119, Spurs 104  Fred VanVleet poured in 26 points in his return after a five-game absence because of injury and Scottie Barnes added 20 points, 18 of them in the second half, as visiting Toronto rolled to a win over San Antonio.  The loss kept Spurs coach Gregg Popovich tied with Don Nelson at 1,335 atop the list of career regular-season NBA coaching wins.  Pascal Siakam also scored 20 points for the Raptors, with Gary Trent Jr. hitting for 17 and Precious Achiuwa adding 13 points as Toronto snapped a three-game losing streak.

Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Reper-USA TODAY Sports  March 8 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods, who inspired a generation of players with his otherworldly talent, charisma and staggering success, took his place among the game's greats on Wednesday as he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.  During a ceremony at PGA Tour headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, Woods delivered a speech about his career and those who helped him along the way after his 14-year-old daughter Sam introduced him for induction.  Woods, 46, got emotional as he recounted the time his parents took out a second mortgage on their house - one that he would later pay off - so that he, at the age of 14, could compete on the American Junior Golf Association circuit.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "You have to understand I got to this position because of my upbringing, having two unbelievable parents," said Woods. "I know that golf is an individual sport, we do things on our own a lot, for hours on end, but in my case I didn't get here alone.  "I have unbelievable parents, mentors and friends who ... supported me in the toughest of times, darkest of times and celebrated the highest of times."  A handful of fellow PGA Tour players who are all competing in The Players Championship starting on Thursday were in attendance, including Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth.  Ever since Woods appeared on television's Mike Douglas Show at the age of two displaying his raw putting skills alongside Bob Hope, he has been expected to produce the remarkable.  The American, whose career is on hold as he recovers from serious leg injuries suffered in a February 2021 car crash, exceeded the hype and has ultimately become one of the world's most celebrated sports figures.  'BURNING DESIRE'  After a successful junior, college and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 and won in only his fifth PGA Tour start, redefining a game that had never been dominated by a Black golfer, and raised the bar on golfers' athleticism.  "Playing at some of these golf courses I was not allowed in the clubhouses where all the other juniors were, the color of my skin dictated that, and as I got older that drove me even more," said Woods.  Woods was a ratings hit the moment he burst onto the scene as a professional and as the sport's popularity grew, so did the prize money paid out at PGA Tour events.  He has won 93 worldwide events, including a record-tying 82 on the PGA Tour, and his 15 major championships trails only the 18 won by Jack Nicklaus.  Woods is also the only modern pro to win all four major golf titles in succession, taking the U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship in 2000 and the Masters in 2001, a feat that became known a the Tiger Slam.  He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom following his 2019 Masters victory which came after years of surgeries and personal problems that convinced many the best golfer of his generation was finished.  "What drove me was the passion to play the game of golf. I was never going to be denied to play. I love it," said Woods.  "One of the things Dad instilled in me, he grew up in the same era of Charlie Sifford where you had to be twice as good to be given half the chance."  Woods was inducted alongside 11-time LPGA winner Susie Maxwell Berning, former PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem and the late Marion Hollins, who broke barriers as one of the few female developers of golf courses in the sport's history.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in the biggest assault on a European state since 1945. Russia calls the action a "special military operation".  "My message is always the same - I want peace in all of the world," world number one Medvedev told reporters on the eve of the first round of ATP action in the Southern California desert.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I think every tennis player is going to say the same."  Indeed, support for the Ukrainian people has been pouring out from the tennis community.  Former world number ones Maria Sharapova and Andy Murray have pledged to support relief funds for children affected by the invasion.  Two million people - mostly women and children - have now fled Ukraine.  Poland's Iga Swiatek encouraged people to support humanitarian organizations and said she was proud that her country has taken in refugees.  She will wear a small ribbon in the colors of the Ukrainian flag when she competes at the tournament and hoped others might do the same.  "If other players feel able to support Ukraine with this symbolic gesture, we prepared more of these ribbons and can give you some," she wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.  Sabalenka, whose home country has served as a staging ground for Russia's invasion, told reporters she would be willing to wear the Ukraine ribbon.  "I feel really sad and really bad about the Ukrainian citizens who lost their homes during the war," said Sabalenka, who like Medvedev is the top seed at the tournament.  "I'm really worried about it but unfortunately it is not under my control.  "I just hope for peace."  While Russians and Belarusian players will not be identified by their nation's symbols, Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who fled the violence with her younger sister, came out for her first round match on Wednesday night draped in her country's blue and yellow flag.  Yastremska, who has won three WTA titles, pledged to donate her prize money from reaching the Lyon Open final last weekend to Ukrainian aid efforts.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko  March 9 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian government is preparing for the potential need to move its data and servers abroad if Russia's invading forces push deeper into the country, a senior cybersecurity official told Reuters on Wednesday.  Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, emphasized his department was planning for a contingency, but that it is being considered at all suggests Ukrainians want to be ready for any Russian threat to seize sensitive government documents.  "We are preparing the ground," Zhora said. Plan A was to protect IT infrastructure within Ukraine. Removing it to a another country would only be a "Plan B or C".  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The move could only happen after regulatory changes approved by Ukrainian lawmakers, Zhora said.  Government officials have already been shipping equipment and backups to more secure areas of Ukraine beyond the reach of Russian forces, who invaded on Feb. 24 and are laying siege to several cities. read more  Last month Zhora told Politico there were plans to move critical data out of the capital Kyiv should it be threatened, but preparations for potentially moving data abroad go a step further.  Ukraine has received offers to host data from a variety of countries, Zhora said, declining to identify them. For reasons of proximity "a European location will be preferred," he said.  "There are a lot options," he said. "All the proposals are highly welcome and worth considering."  Zhora gave few details of how such a move might be executed, but he said past efforts to keep government data out of Russia's grasp involved either the physical transport of servers and removable storage devices or the digital migration of data from one service or server to another.  PROTOCOL  Even if lawmakers agreed to lift the restriction on sending Ukrainian data abroad and a protocol for the removal of IT assets were established, it would not necessarily mean that all or even most of the government's data or network equipment would immediately be sent out of the country, Zhora said.  Government agencies would have to decide on a case by case basis whether to keep their operations running inside the country or evacuate them.  What to do in wartime with piles of data gathered by governments became a topic of international concern following the Taliban's lightning offensive in Afghanistan last August that took city after city as U.S. and other foreign forces withdrew.  The Taliban conquest of Kabul meant that their forces were in a position to inherit sensitive data - such as payroll information for Afghan government employees and soldiers - which they could potentially mine for leads on how to arrest or eliminate domestic opponents.  Similar concerns are at play in Ukraine. Russia possessing Ukrainian government databases and intelligence files could be helpful if Russia wanted to control Ukraine.  Pavol Jakubec, a historian at Sweden's University of Gothenburg, said Ukraine was not necessarily planning for a potential government in exile, usually a last resort.  "It may be that they want to forestall potential Russian efforts to block their operations, analogue and digital," he said.  In 1940 Norway physically sent the bulk of its Foreign Ministry archives to the north of the country and then eventually to Britain as German forces invaded, Jakubec said.  Beyond trying to protect citizens under occupation, Ukrainian officials would want to deny Russian forces the opportunity to possess documents "which could otherwise be doctored by the enemy and used for propaganda purposes," Jakubec said.

REUTERS/Edgar Su/  March 10 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency evangelists are on the defensive amid warnings from U.S. and European lawmakers that digital asset companies are not up to the task of complying with Western sanctions imposed on Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine.  The criticism has seen the crypto industry scrambling to regain control of the narrative, with many executives frustrated that the compliance regimes in place at leading exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, are being called into question.  At the same time, the increased scrutiny could be a pivotal moment for the sector to prove that it is not the "Wild West" of finance that regulators have painted it to be.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "It's an opportunity for the industry to show that it is mature and that it knows how to properly manage risk," said Matt Homer, an executive in residence at venture capital firm Nyca Partners.  The crypto community was largely caught flat-footed as the United States and its allies moved to impose sweeping sanctions against Russia's banks, elites and other state firms.  Unlike other payment companies, crypto exchanges have rejected calls to cut off all Russian users, saying that goes against the industry's libertarian values, sparking concerns among European officials and U.S. lawmakers that digital assets could be used to circumvent the sanctions. read more  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has alleged that many crypto exchanges and wallets have lax compliance controls and are not collecting data on customers' identities. read more  But executives at exchanges including Kraken, FTX, Coinbase and Gemini, as well as industry trade groups, say that's not the case.  "This rhetoric is inaccurate," said Elena Hughes, chief compliance officer at Gemini, adding that the company screens clients like any other financial firm. "We've dedicated a lot of resources to ensure that we have the right controls (and) that we've gotten things right."  On Monday, Coinbase issued a lengthy blog detailing its controls, noting that it had blocked more than 25,000 addresses connected with Russian individuals or entities believed to be engaging in illegal activity.  FTX US, a Chicago-based crypto exchange, said it operates multiple regulated licenses and continues to "rigorously implement and comply" with all sanctions.  "For the most part, most of these companies have very robust systems in place already, and it's very easy for them to comply with sanctions, just like any other financial institution," said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.  'EXISTENTIAL' RISK  From its inception, the cryptocurrency community touted digital assets as vehicles for anonymous transactions, and a slew of federal enforcement actions for fraud, money laundering and unregistered coin offerings has only reinforced the perception that crypto companies are prone to flouting the law.  But as the value of all cryptocurrencies surged past $3 trillion last year and more Americans invest in the asset class, the industry has been trying to shed its unsavory image by burnishing its overall compliance credentials. read more  While lawmakers worry about crypto sanctions evasion, Biden administration officials have said they do not believe digital assets could be used to circumvent all the curbs.  The U.S. Treasury Department has reached out to several crypto exchanges and trade groups to explain its expectations for sanctions compliance and to create a line of communication in case of questions, a person familiar with the matter said.  This person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that officials were impressed by the majority of firms' compliance controls.  For many exchanges, the risk of not being in compliance with the rules as they stand is "existential," said Charles Delingpole, chief executive officer at ComplyAdvantage, an anti-money laundering technology company that works with several prominent crypto firms, including Binance and Gemini.  "Not only in terms of being fined (and) having dollar clearing access removed," he said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street's watchdog voted to unveil a rule on Wednesday that aims to enhance how public companies disclose when they experience a breach, and how soon.  Under the proposed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) measures, a company would have to spell out when it experiences a risk and what strategies it has employed to address and manage such risks in current report filings, including Form 8-K.  The rule changes, which are subject to public consultation, would also require an analysis of how the cyber risks are likely to affect the company's financials. This would allow investors to assess these risks more effectively, and to locate them more readily, the SEC said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The 3-1 vote by the commission to issue changes comes at a time of growing regulatory concern about how cyber security issues could affect markets and investors. Regulators have warned, for example, of cyber attacks from Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions. read more  President Joe Biden's administration has also ratcheted up its focus on the issue after a recent series of high-profile cyber attacks on U.S.-based companies.  "The interconnectedness of our networks, the use of predictive data analytics and the insatiable desire for data are only accelerating, putting our financial accounts, investments, private information at risk," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday.  "They're like honeypots sitting inside of companies and investors want to know more about how issuers are managing those growing risks."  Wednesday's measure would also require updates in periodic reports to give investors more complete information on previously disclosed, material cybersecurity incidents, the agency said.  The proposals would build on existing SEC cyber risk guidance, which is set to remain in effect, even under the SEC's new rules, an agency official told reporters.  "How a company might think about the impact (of a breach) to management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions ... should still be taken into consideration," the official added.  The SEC has long warned companies that materiality of a cyber breach should not be limited to the quantitative impact on revenue or assets, but should consider qualitative factors that a reasonable investor would consider in making decisions.  Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, who dissented on the proposal, said the move goes beyond the agency's mission.  "This proposal flirts with casting us as the nation's Cybersecurity Command Center -- a role Congress didn't give us," she said.  Tom Quaadman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said he welcomes attention to the matter of cybersecurity risk management, but urged that the SEC liaise with other federal cyber experts to help "ensure policies are supportive, not duplicative."  "The SEC, as a disclosure agency, should be mindful to not get in the way of national security priorities and focus on robust coordination."

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  March 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is launching an initiative to raise awareness about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies as the digital asset moves from the fringes of the financial system to the mainstream, a top official said.  The Treasury’s Financial Literacy Education Commission will create educational materials and organize outreach to inform the public about how crypto assets work and how they differ from other forms of payment.  Populations that have limited access to mainstream financial services is a key group the Treasury will look to reach, Nellie Liang, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, said in an interview.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  “We’re hearing more and more about investors and households who are purchasing crypto assets, and we recognize the complexity of how some of these assets operate,” Liang said.  "It felt like this is an area also where more education (and) more awareness could be helpful."  The initiative underscores growing concerns among regulators that crypto assets could pose risks to the financial system as they grow in popularity.  The value of cryptocurrencies surged past $3 trillion last year, with approximately 14% of Americans invested in digital assets as of 2021, according to University of Chicago research.  Companies like Crypto.com and FTX are helping to drive mainstream adoption with flashy marketing campaigns featuring celebrities and athletes, including at this year's Super Bowl. read more  The Treasury's education unit comprises 20 different agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Its chair, Gary Gensler, last year called the crypto industry the “wild west” of finance “rife with fraud, scams and abuse.” While the Biden administration and many lawmakers believe a regulatory framework is needed for digital assets, they have yet to agree on one.  While crypto does present risks, the Treasury is also conscious it could offer benefits, such as improving cross-border payments or bolstering financial inclusion, said Liang.  “We're just trying to raise awareness without trying to stamp out new technology and new innovation,” she said.

March 9 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian man charged last year with conducting one of the most severe ransomware attacks against U.S. targets has been extradited to the United States and made a court appearance on Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department said.  According to an August 2021 indictment, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, accessed the internal computer networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to encrypt the data on their computers, the Justice Department said in a statement.  Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2021 ransomware attack against Florida software provider Kaseya, the department said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reuters could not reach a representative of Vasinskyi. Kaseya did not immediately return a message seeking comment.  The Ukrainian national was accused in the indictment of breaking into Kaseya over the July 4 weekend last year, and simultaneously distributing with accomplices REvil ransomware to as many as 1,500 Kaseya customers, encrypting their data and forcing some to shut down for days, the Justice Department said.  While most of the 1,500 businesses paralyzed as a result across the globe faced limited concerns, the disruption was felt keenly in places like Sweden, where hundreds of supermarkets had to close because their cash registers were inoperative, or New Zealand, where schools and kindergartens were knocked offline.  Vasinskyi was charged in the indictment with breaking into the victim companies and installing encryption software, developed by the core REvil ransomware hacking group. REvil directly handled the ransom negotiations and split the profits with affiliates like Vasinskyi. This model allowed the notorious ransomware gang to extort numerous companies for cryptocurrency.  Vasinskyi was arrested in Poland in October, and charged late last year along with a Russian by the Justice Department. read more  Vasinskyi was transported to Dallas by U.S. law enforcement authorities where he arrived on March 3, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.

Enterprise Holdings/Handout via REUTERS  March 9 (Reuters) - The $100 billion Western rental car industry, flush with cash from a profitable pandemic, is gradually getting its electric show on the road, and Chinese-made vehicles are poised to play a starring role.  The electric transition could see car fleets, long dominated by famed marques from the United States and Europe, increasingly switch towards Asian automakers, according to a European executive.  "Historically, European and American manufacturers had an edge, but the shift towards electric is reshuffling the cards," said Olivier Baldassari, group chief countries and operations officer at rental giant Europcar (EUCAR.PA).  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  He said electric cars from Chinese and Asian makers were comparable to Western models in terms of quality, citing Great Wall Motor's (601633.SS) Ora line, but generally cost less.  Even small savings are significant in the vast rental industry, which buys millions of new cars a year - a tenth of all new cars in the United States alone - and provides a leading indicator of wider auto trends in society.  Companies in the sector have long resisted a rush to electrify because of weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs) among customers worried about being stranded out of power.  Yet several analysts said now is the best time to start as companies have fortified their coffers with bumper profits during a pandemic that emptied public transit and airports, and led to more holidaying within driving distance.  In the United States, rental car companies received record monthly revenue of $1,320 per vehicle in 2021, according to the American Car Rental Association. That compares to around $1,000 pre-pandemic.  "In the past, companies have kind of stuck their head in the sand," said Nick Mountfield, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, which advises rental car companies, said about electrification. "We're now starting to see people say that they'll have to do something about and put in place plans."  Reuters Graphics  Graphic on U.S. rental fleet: https://tmsnrt.rs/34PGDVK  Reuters Graphics  Graphic on U.S. rental car revenue: https://tmsnrt.rs/3JHCORx  WATCH YOUR SPEED  Hertz (HTZ.O) was an early mover last October when it announced the planned purchase of 100,000 vehicles from U.S. trailblazer Tesla (TSLA.O), upping the pressure on rivals to spell out transition plans.  French-based Europcar, meanwhile, pledged to make 20% of its fleet electric or low-emission hybrid by 2024, from 3% now, which means it will need to buy up to 70,000 cleaner vehicles in the coming two years if it restocks its fleet to the 350,000 vehicles it owned pre-pandemic.  Rental companies sold off their fleets as demand plummeted at the start of the pandemic and have struggled to regain volumes amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has hampered vehicle production.  Baldassari said Europcar was increasingly sourcing EVs from Great Wall Motors, SAIC Motor (600104.SS) and Polestar , which is owned by China's Geely [RIC:RIC:GEELY.UL] and Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), though it was also buying from traditional partners, including Renault (RENA.PA) and Stellantis (STLA.MI).  The company's China strategy might shift, however, if German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) manages to close its offer to buy the company in the second quarter.  Industry players are running at different speeds, with each making their own calculations based on their markets.  In the United States, where many customers prefer SUV and pickup models that have yet to be electrified and public charging infrastructure lags much of Asia and Europe, Enterprise Holdings is striking a more cautious tone.  Electrifying just a quarter of Enterprise's fleet at Orlando airport - its largest consumer rental location - would require the same amount of daily electricity as is needed to power more than 1,000 homes, said Enterprise's assistant vice president of innovation, Chris Haffenreffer.  Haffenreffer said the group currently had several thousand EVs in North America, including from Tesla, Nissan , Hyundai (005380.KS), Kia and Polestar. While the company said it has conversations with all global automakers, it has no immediate plans to boost that share.  "At a high level, we want to let our consumers guide us in terms of what they're looking for," he added. "Many car rental companies have historically taken that wait-and-see approach because we are still in the early phases of the transition."  Reuters Graphics  Graphic on U.S. industry vehicle purchases: https://tmsnrt.rs/3gXAVnj  FOOTHOLD IN THE WEST  The varied pace of change, and the timeline for vast fleet overhauls means gasoline-powered vehicles are expected to remain the bulk of purchases for some years to come. Global automakers' transition plans as a whole would see electric vehicles make up at least 40% of their sales by 2040.  Yet eventually the shift could prove far-reaching for the fortunes of Chinese in carmakers in Europe, a crowded, competitive auto market dominated by storied brands that has proved elusive for them to crack in the past.  In years gone by, they have contended with a perception that China, associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Yet such arguments are challenged in a new reality that sees top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla now produce cars in the country, which is a technology powerhouse and the world's biggest auto market.  Great Wall Motor, one of Europcar's suppliers, is expected to launch its Ora Cat compact electric car in Europe this year priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,260) with a range of around 250 miles (400 km), joining a growing number of Chinese EV makers trying their luck on the continent. read more  Chinese manufacturers using the rental channel to establish brand awareness and increase sales volumes would follow a playbook Kia and Hyundai used in the 1990s to gain a foothold in Western markets, said Mountfield at OC&C Strategy.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly  ORLANDO, Fla., March 9 (Reuters) - A flattening yield curve and slumping consumer confidence have been warning for months that U.S. recession risks are rising, but the alarm bells are suddenly being amplified by a rare quirk in the interest rate futures market.  In technical terms, the June 2023-December 2023 Eurodollar curve has inverted. In plain English, traders are beginning to price in Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the second half of next year, before the tightening cycle has even started.  This inversion had previously been seen further out the curve, into 2024. But that was before war in Europe, eye-watering surges in oil, gas, and commodities prices, and cratering global markets radically shifted the dial.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  To be sure, the Eurodollar curve is not a pure snapshot of the Fed's expected policy path. It can be distorted by perceived credit risk and strong hedging demand from a wide range of players, including overseas sovereigns.  But as Joseph Wang, a former trader on the Fed's trading desk points out, it is unusual, and merits attention.  "This is rare, but we have rare events going on. There is a huge amount of uncertainty," Wang said. "The core of the financial system, banks, will be fine. But there is definitely concern about contagion and there could be reverberations that people are not familiar with."  Chart  FCI, 6-YEAR HIGH  Could the U.S. economy fall into recession next year, or even this year? Economists are lowering their 2022 growth forecasts closer to 3% from 4% at the start of the year, with risks still to the downside in large part due to oil. Average gas prices at U.S. pumps are now the highest ever.  Annual growth of 3% would be nowhere near contraction. But global geopolitical and financial developments are unfolding so quickly there is precious little visibility for the coming weeks, never mind the rest of the year and beyond.  Global financial conditions are now the tightest in six years, according to Goldman Sachs's Global Financial Conditions Index. Higher long rates, wider credit spreads, lower equities have all contributed to the rapid tightening this year.  The U.S. economy's direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe is small. The euro zone, for example, will be hit much harder by the raging conflict and energy prices.  But U.S. consumer confidence has plummeted to a 10-year low, and the 10-year Treasury yield is only 20 basis points away from going below the two-year yield. Every U.S. recession in the past 40 years has been preceded by a big fall in consumer confidence and an inversion of the yield curve.  GS global financial conditions  Chart  Chart  BEAR MARKET  While high and rising inflation was on everyone's radar at the start of the year, no one had recession in their 2022 play book.  "Markets should focus on the growth outlook and the rhythm of its deceleration rather than on inflation risk, which is already priced into the bond and commodities markets," Unigestion's Guilhem Savry wrote on Tuesday.  A rosy growth outlook at the turn of the year was one of the pillars on which the equally bullish and broad-based 2022 equity market consensus was built.  A cursory look back through Wall Street banks' 2022 outlooks shows the 'R' word was hardly mentioned. Yes, earnings growth might slow and valuations looked a bit rich, but as long as the economy avoided recession Wall Street would climb another 10% or so.  Bank of America research highlights the extent of investors' economic optimism and market bullishness back in January: the gap between bullish equities and bearish bonds sentiment was historically wide, only 7% of investors expected recession this year, and less than a third expected a bear market this year.  More astonishing of all, BofA found that a record $949 billion flowed into global equity funds last year, more than the past 20 years combined.  Even assuming some of that flow naturally evaporates as Wall Street heads lower - the Nasdaq became a bear market this week - and most of it stays invested, there is still potential for huge relative value shifts or reallocation into safer assets.  "We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price," Morgan Stanley's equity strategists wrote on Monday, adding: "As such, we recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal."

Market participants have been trying to figure out what the loss of grain exports out of Ukraine and Russia will mean in the short- and long-term, and it was uncertain what USDA would do with those numbers this month, if anything.  USDA cut 12% or 7 million tonnes total from Ukraine and Russia wheat exports in the current 2021-22 year, reducing their combined export share to a still massive 26% from 29%. Most of those losses went into the countries’ respective stocks.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Stocks-to-use among global wheat exporters had been set for an all-time low of 12.7%, but the Black Sea adjustments put that supply-versus-demand ratio at 14%. That is down from last year’s 15% and the second-lowest all-time after 13% in 2007-08, the last time wheat prices were as high as current levels.  India and Australia picked up some of those lost exports, but overall global exports were pegged down from last month. However, they are still above the predictions from a few months ago when grain prices were near recent minimums, demonstrating how steep prices have not exactly killed off demand, particularly versus initial expectations.  USDA took Ukraine corn exports down by 6 million tonnes (18%) and added nearly 2 million worth of business to the United States, but shipment predictions for Argentina and Brazil were left unchanged.  U.S. corn export sales for 2021-22 are not necessarily behind the needed pace for the export bump, but they cannot falter in the coming months and could use a boost. They have been a bit lighter than normal in recent weeks, which may not be too bad considering the high prices.  USDA’s global 2021-22 corn stocks-to-use was unchanged from last month in Wednesday’s update, still at eight-year lows and down slightly from last year. However, that same ratio for soybeans shrank a bit further, keeping both the projection for eight-year lows and the pressure on the upcoming U.S. crop.  That is despite a huge demand reduction from top buyer China, which USDA sees importing 94 million tonnes of soybeans this year versus 97 million last month and 100 million in January. The agency’s Brazil crop peg landed below trade ideas at 127 million tonnes versus 134 million in February and 139 million in January.  Aside from sharp losses out of top supplier Brazil, China’s lower soybean demand goes along with its recent idea of notably cutting soybean and meal use going forward. But Chinese buyers are clearly concerned enough to have aggressively booked new-crop U.S. soybeans in recent weeks instead of waiting for their normal buying period, July and August, when prices could potentially be lower.  USDA reduced combined Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay soybean exports by about 6.6 million tonnes (6.7%), and U.S. exporters were assigned just over 1 million tonnes' worth of business, a 2% increase. Many analysts had expected such a change to U.S. exports last month and recent sales have been abnormally strong.  U.S. soy ending stocks for 2021-22 came in at 285 million bushels, the lowest estimate since September and down from 325 million last month. That is above last year’s 257 million, but it reduces wiggle room for the next U.S. harvest, where soybeans may be fiercely competing with corn for acres.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan  LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 10 (Reuters) - The skyrocketing price of crude oil and natural gas in Europe in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is grabbing the bulk of headlines, but their gains look modest compared to those of thermal coal.  While coal may be exiting the electricity sector in Europe and North America, it remains the most vital source of power generation for much of Asia.  Seaborne thermal coal prices have soared to record highs in recent sessions, with the market spooked by the potential loss of Russian cargoes, flood-related supply disruptions in Australia and the threat of another Indonesian export ban.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Futures linked to the Australian benchmark Newcastle index ended at $415 a tonne on Wednesday, down from the recent record high of $440 on March 2.  The contract has spiked 145% since the end of last year, with much of the gain coming since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, with the price closing at $237.70 a tonne the day prior.  To put coal's gain into perspective, benchmark Brent crude futures closed at $112.51 a barrel on Wednesday, up 45% from the end of last year, while Dutch natural gas ended at 148 euros per megawatt hour, a gain of 115% from the last trading day in 2021.  And it's not just paper coal markets that are on fire, the gains have been matched by some physical trades as well, with globalCOAL reporting the sale of Newcastle coal for April at a premium of $38 a tonne to the index, and for June at a premium of $48.  South African coal, which can arbitrage between European and Asian destinations, saw a March cargo trade at a premium of $30 a tonne to the index price at the country's Richards Bay port, according to globalCOAL.  While these prices look unsustainably high, it's worth noting that relatively small volumes are transacted on a spot basis in the coal market.  Far more common are short- and medium-term contracts, with utilities in major seaborne buyers such as Japan and South Korea preferring to negotiate prices with miners well ahead of delivery times.  However, the surging price of spot coal will eventually be reflected in these types of contracts as well, leading to significant inflation in energy costs for countries that rely on imported fuel.  While cargoes currently being loaded and sailing will have been bought at prices well below the present level, it's likely that from April onwards the market will have to bear the full extent of spike caused by the Ukraine crisis.  DEMAND DROP COMING?  As yet, there is little sign of major demand destruction, although price sensitive buyers such as India, the world's second-biggest coal importer, are starting to see import volumes decline.  India brought in 7.33 million tonnes of thermal coal, used for power generation, in February, up slightly from 7.08 million in January, which was the weakest month since June 2020, according to data and analytics company Kpler.  India's thermal coal imports are more usually in a range between 10 and 15 million tonnes a month, with Indonesia, South Africa and Australia the biggest suppliers.  China's imports of thermal coal also weakened in the first two months of 2022, with Kpler showing volumes of 10.38 million tonnes in February and 10.11 million in January, down from 19.35 million in December.  Indonesia's short-lived export ban in January would explain much of the decline in China's imports, but Beijing has also been working hard to get domestic miners to ramp up production in order to secure energy supplies.  The question for Asia's seaborne coal market is how quickly the current unprecedented prices will translate into demand destruction.  It's very likely that buyers such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan will avoid buying coal as their utilities will be massively loss-making if they paid the current price, or even half of what is right now.  Utilities in Japan and South Korea have less choice, given that the alternative of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is even more expensive on a spot basis, and the surge in crude prices will filter through to oil-linked contracts in coming months as well.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Reuters) - Pixar Studios' latest film "Turning Red" wants to break a taboo by addressing what a girl goes through during puberty, but with an analogy.  Meilin Lee, voiced by Rosalie Chiang, is an overly confident student excelling in every field. But one night, she goes to bed and wakes up as a giant red panda.  In this form, Meilin experiences many of the things pubescent teenagers go through: appearance of new hair, body dysmorphia, embarrassment about sexual feelings and heightened emotions.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "It's taboo for whatever reason because people don't talk about it," director and co-writer Domee Shi told Reuters.  "It's like the self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact that this is so shocking to be the first film to really talk about it is probably the very reason that we don't talk about it," producer Lindsey Collins added.  "Killing Eve" actress Sandra Oh voices Meilin's overprotective mother, Ming. She says it's important for children to understand what happens during puberty rather than leaving them suffering in silence.  "A friend of mine who saw this film with their 10-year-old son suddenly had to have a conversation about sexuality and what is it that girls go through," she said.  "Girls go through this and then boys will go through this, so it opens up a conversation."  Oh says the film wouldn't have existed without a push in Hollywood to add female voices to productions.  "The fact that it exists and that's the primary focus is how you can feel that things have changed," she said.  Last month, Walt Disney Pictures (DIS.N) said they were pausing theatrical releases in Russia because of the crisis in Ukraine. They cited "Turning Red" as the first film they wouldn't be releasing there.  "We found out when everybody found out and I think there was a question 'Oh, are you guys OK with that decision?' and we were like 'No we're 100% OK with that decision'," Collins said.  "Turning Red" will be released globally on Disney+ on March 11, with the movie also screening in cinemas in some countries.

The Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra also performed an excerpt from Beethoven's "Ode to Joy", on which the European Union's anthem is based - a nod to the Ukraine government's desire to move closer to Europe and away from Russia's orbit.  Dozens of people gathered to watch on the central Maidan Square, some waving Ukrainian flags. They applauded when the national anthem was finished and a woman cried out "To Ukraine!"  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The lyrics of the anthem include the lines, "Ukraine has not yet perished.... our enemies will vanish like dew in the sun."  Conductor Herman Makarenko told reporters that the concert was a call for peace.  "We would like to support our president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who called, calls and will call to all governments of the world (to) stop the war in Ukraine."  He said he managed to gather around 20 musicians for the performance, instead of 65-70 who normally make up the ensemble.  Tens of thousands of people, worried about being cut off by enemy troops, have left the capital for the relative safety of western Ukraine.  1/5 Conductor Herman Makarenko performs during an open-air concert named "Free Sky" at the Independence Square in central Kyiv, Ukraine March 9, 2022. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Read More  Russian forces are advancing on Kyiv from several directions, although heavy fighting on the outskirts has slowed their progress.  Air raid sirens wailed in Kyiv on Wednesday and soldiers searched cars at checkpoints on main thoroughfares, reminders that the city of 3.4 million is on a war footing.  Thousands of civilians have joined local defence units to support Ukraine's armed forces and civilians in some areas under Russian control have gathered on streets to protest.  Moscow launched what it calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine on Feb. 24 to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and remove what it says are dangerous nationalists in Kyiv.  Ukraine and its allies call Russia's actions a brutal invasion that has killed hundreds of civilians and forced millions to flee abroad.  Kyiv has mostly been spared the heavy shelling that devastated parts of other urban centres including Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy, but Ukrainian forces are bolstering defences in anticipation of a full assault.  Wednesday's concert was held on the vast square where thousands of Ukrainian protesters set up a tent city in 2013 and 2014 to oppose then-President Viktor Yanukovich's shock decision to suspend talks with the EU and revive ties with Moscow.  More than 100 protesters were killed in clashes with security forces, and in 2014 Yanukovich was toppled and forced to flee the country.  A decade earlier, the square had been a major focal point for participants in the so-called "Orange Revolution", which overturned a disputed election won by Yanukovich and led to the pro-Western leader Viktor Yushchenko taking his place.

Twin males Tsar and Jamil, born in January 2021, were due to be transferred to Belgium in May after the Ukrainian authorities seized them from private owners who had mistreated them.  However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant the transfer had to happen immediately, with shelling of Kyiv, where they were held, causing them stress and injury as they jumped against their cages.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Frederik Thoelen, a biologist who has worked at the Belgian shelter since 2007, recounted the lions' tough five-day journey from Kyiv on Feb. 26 to Poland's Poznan zoo, beginning with an encounter with Russian military outside the Ukrainian capital.  1/6 A lion, who was in an animal shelter in Kyiv, is seen in a cage at "Natuurhulpcentrum" nature centre after its planned transfer procedures were accelerated following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Oudsbergen, Belgium March 9, 2022. REUTERS/Clement Rossignol Read More  "The Russian army, they pointed their guns at the carers. They threatened to kill the animals. The carers said 'no those are our animals. If you touch the animals you first have to touch us'," Thoelen told Reuters on Wednesday.  "So they risked literally their lives to save the animals. Eventually the Russian army let them through. Then they had a long, long way to the Polish border. They had to drive through different small routes to avoid the traffic jams," he continued.  Russia denies it has targeted civilians.  The lions arrived at the Natuurhulpcentrum shelter, one of few able to provide immediate care to wild animals, late on Tuesday. The shelter will hold them in quarantine for three months and nurse them back to health before starting to look for permanent homes, such as sanctuaries in Africa.  The shelter said the lion twins were abnormally small when rescued, lacking essential elements such as calcium and malnourished after being fed expired meat, while X-rays revealed bone fractures.

Picture taken March 8, 2022. REUTERS/Oleksandr Lapshyn  KHARKIV, Ukraine, March 9 (Reuters) - As Russian forces pound the city with artillery and air strikes, staff at the main museum in Kharkiv raced to get priceless artworks to safety, many of them by Russian artists.  The ornate, imposing building is still standing, unlike some others in Kharkiv, but the windows have been blown in by the blasts, plaster and dust cover the floors and the surrounding streets are covered in debris.  "There are over 25,000 items in our collection," said Maryna Filatova, head of the foreign art department at the Kharkiv Art Museum, adding that it was one of the biggest and most valuable in the country.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "It is simply irony of fate that we should be saving Russian artists, paintings by Russian artists from their own nation. This is simply barbarism," she told Reuters on Wednesday.  Across Ukraine, millions of people have fled the fighting while many more are staying to repel the advancing Russian forces. As well as lives and infrastructure, some are trying to save Ukraine's culture and history.  In Odessa on the southern coast, a monument to Duc de Richelieu, a governor of the city in the early 19th century, has been protected by sandbags piled around the plinth and statue up to its shoulders.  Moscow launched what it calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine on Feb. 24 to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and remove what it says are dangerous nationalists in Kyiv. It denies targeting civilians.  Ukraine and its allies call Russia's actions a brutal invasion that has killed hundreds of civilians and forced millions to flee abroad.  One of the most prized works at the Kharkiv museum is a version of the imposing work by renowned Russian painter Ilya Repin called "Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks", which has been taken down from the wall ready to be stored away.  "Basically, it should not be moved," said Filatova of the painting. "Any movement should be avoided. We treat it with great care."  She spoke among the empty, cold galleries where some pictures still hung and others were propped against walls, waiting to be stowed away.  Filatova and her colleagues were relieved that the collection, which includes works by German painter and printmaker Albrecht Duerer and Dutch masters, remained intact.  But with the windows shattered, it was impossible to control the temperature and humidity inside the gallery.  "The real damage we will only be able to assess in peaceful times, when it is calm.  "Workers, women that are still in town, we will work and do our best to save it all. We are taking the paintings down and will hide them," Filatova said, without specifying where. "We are doing our best to preserve them."

REUTERS/Iryna Nazarchuk  ODESSA, Ukraine, March 8 (Reuters) - (This March 8 story has been refiled to correct typographical error in byline)  From behind sandbags and anti-tank barriers in front of Odessa’s Opera and Ballet Theatre, a familiar if unexpected melody drifted across the near-deserted streets of Ukraine’s main Black Sea port on Tuesday: "Don’t Worry, Be Happy."  Odessa has so far escaped shelling but its one million people are nervously waiting to see if their historic city will be next to suffer the heavy Russian bombardment after Kyiv and Mariupol to the north and east.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The defiance is written in the giant blue and yellow banner "Odessa-Ukraine" draped atop the sandbags in the near-deserted city centre, and even music has been pressed into the national cause of raising morale.  "We did not surrender Odessa to Hitler, and we will not surrender it to anyone else," said Galyna Zitser, director of the Odessa Philharmonic, which on Tuesday put on its first performance since the crisis began, at the request of a local company seeking to celebrate a holiday.  And in similar vein a handful of navy musicians in uniform put on an impromptu rendition of the national anthem, and Bobby McFerrin's 1980's chart hit about overcoming tribulations.  "I can’t say that I’m not scared, I am very scared, especially when we see this news, broken cities, dead soldiers," Zitser told Reuters.  "We pray for the president, for our military, that God would give them the strength and health to protect us."  The orchestra's website strikes a similar tone, informing its audiences that concerts are postponed "due to the imposition of martial law in Ukraine" and urging them to stay calm and trust only "reliable official sources" before signing off: "Glory to Ukraine!"  The sea is central to Odessa's status as an important trading, industrial and transportation hub.  High among people's fears is the threat of attack from the water, across which lies the Crimean peninsula invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014.  Locals have been filling bags with sand on the beach and taking part in weapons training. And on Monday Ukraine’s navy said its forces defending the Odessa region hit a Russian vessel in the Black Sea with gunfire.  That threat means that Vasyl Miloserdnyi, 61, and his wife have not gone on their usual long sea walk since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.  Miloserdnyi said that from time to time they hear the distant sound of explosions and they, like their neighbours, have sealed their apartment windows with adhesive tape as a precaution.  But there has been no panic, he said - the shops have food, there is cash available, for now, and farmers from surrounding villages bring milk, meat and eggs to the markets.  “Odessites did not panic, they did not pull the last pieces of food off the shelves," he said. "We hope that all this will be resolved soon, it will end."  A spokeswoman for the mayor said they had no statistics on how many residents had left the city. She said there were many at the railway station from different towns around the Odessa and Kherson regions, mostly waiting for evacuation trains going mainly to Lviv in the west.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Iryna Nazarchuk in Odessa and Natalia Zinets in Lviv.

Robert Pattinson's pitch-black superhero adventure "The Batman" collected a mighty $128.5 million in its box office debut, marking the best opening weekend of 2022 by a landslide. But what is more impressive: it's only the second pandemic-era movie to cross the $100 million mark in a single weekend, a feat first achieved by "Spider-Man: No Way Home," which launched last December to a historic $260 million.  Thanks to positive reviews, strong reception from ticket buyers and high levels of intrigue to see Pattinson's moody take on the Caped Crusader, "The Batman" is shaping up to be a commercial winner for Warner Bros. That's good news because the studio shelled out a hefty $200 million to produce the film and spent many millions more in marking and distribution costs. Bringing Batman to the big screen doesn't come cheap, and achieving profitability won't be easy.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The Batman" also likely benefitted because the comic book adaptation is playing exclusively in theaters. For Warner Bros., which opted to debut its entire 2021 theatrical film slate simultaneously on HBO Max, "The Batman" marks a deviation as the studio's first movie in over a year that's only available to watch in cinemas. "The Batman" lands on HBO Max in 45 days.  It's impossible to know the box office impact of putting movies day-and-date on streaming, but "The Batman" has generated more money in its opening weekend than any other Warner Bros. pandemic movies grossed in their entire theatrical runs. Prior to "The Batman," the studio's highest grossing movies since March 2020 were "Godzilla vs. Kong" ($100 million in North America) and "Dune" ($109 million in North America).  Of course, it helps that "The Batman" has the glittery promise of a former "Twilight" heartthrob playing one of the most famous comic book characters in history. But there were plenty of factors that could have worked against a different, less-embraced version of "The Batman." For one, it clocks in at three hours, which is a long sit for even the biggest movie-lover. Not to mention, the logistics of its lengthy running time meant that theater operators had to limit the number of screenings per day.  Since "The Batman," directed by Matt Reeves, notched a PG-13 rating rather than R, the film was able to capture the key demographic of younger males, who have been fueling the domestic box office's wobbly recovery.  In addition to Pattinson, "The Batman" stars Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Andy Serkis as Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth, and Colin Farrell as a crime lord known as Penguin. By focusing on Bruce Wayne's alter ego as "the world's greatest detective," the movie feels more like a gritty noir than an escapist superhero adventure. Reviews seemed to be fond of that approach, since "The Batman" has been praised for feeling notably distinct from past adventures centered on Gotham's ferocious defender, like director Christopher Nolan's revered "The Dark Knight" trilogy or Ben Affleck's brooding, middle-aged take on the character in "Batman v. Superman.  Prior to this weekend, Tom Holland's video game adaptation "Uncharted" held the title for the biggest opening weekend of the year with $44 million in initial sales. "The Batman," based on a far more ubiquitous property, beat that benchmark after earning $57 million on opening day alone. Yet "Uncharted," which is still playing in theaters, managed to bring in solid business despite the outsized attention for "The Batman." In second place, the film pocketed $10 million from 3,875 theaters between Friday and Sunday, pushing "Uncharted" past $100 million at the domestic box office.  Channing Tatum's canine adventure "Dog" landed at No. 3 with $6 million from 3,507 theaters. The road-trip buddy comedy continues to surprise, crossing $40 million in North America over the weekend. In COVID-19 times, it's a promising result for a $15 million-budgeted film.  "Spider-Man: No Way Home" and "Death on the Nile" took spots four and five on domestic box office charts.  The third Spidey installment with Holland at the helm brought in $4.3 million over the weekend, boosting its domestic tally to a towering $786 million. It's the third weekend in a row that Holland has been in two of the top four movies at the weekend box office. In an especially rare feat, "No Way Home" has managed to stay within the top five on domestic rankings since the film premiered in December.  Disney and 20th Century's murder mystery "Death on the Nile" grossed $2.6 million between Friday and Sunday. After four weekends on the big screen, the movie has earned a so-so $37 million in North America. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who stars in the movie alongside Armie Hammer, Gal Gadot and Letitia Wright, "Death on the Nile" cost $90 million to produce.

Horobets and her husband had fled their home in the eastern city of Kramatorsk as Ukrainian troops fought Russian invaders.  But after a difficult journey west on a packed train they finally decided to let their pet go, concluding that setting up a new life hundreds of miles from home would be hard enough without a hyperactive cat to care for.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Our trip by train lasted for 40 hours," Natalia Horobets said in Lviv, which along with the rest of Ukraine's west has so far been largely untouched by the conflict. "There were many people and we were afraid that he would be trampled."  Rasma Krecia, a Latvian volunteer, is the rescuer hoping to take Charly and dozens of other pets across the border into Poland until the war is over.  "We’re going to try to take as many animals as we can out, back to Latvia, back to Europe, back to safety," Krecia said at the Home for Rescued Animals in Lviv, where she was loading up three vans with the first batch of dogs and cats.  1/4 A little cat waits for its evacuation at an animal shelter, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Lviv, Ukraine, March 7, 2022.

"If I have an opportunity, if I have a large van, if I can bring food here and take some animals back to safety, I can’t stay at home."  The Lviv sanctuary previously dealt with wild animals and strays, but since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 it has taken in more animals from people fleeing the violence.

As Krecia prepared to fit cages to her vans, the Horobets family said their final farewells to their cat.  “Charly, my little one, you will come back home, but you need to stay in a different place for now, you will be good there,” said Natalia Horobets.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

I remember a bright, crisp winter day. Photographs tell me the sky was the more usual Moscow grey, with puddles on the pavement suggesting it might have been raining shortly before. Where memory and pictures agree is that a crowd of thousands of patient Muscovites had come early that morning to Pushkin Square, one of the most iconic places in the Russian capital, to get a taste of a McDonald’s (MCD.N) burger.  It was Jan. 31, 1990. Russian journalists, foreign correspondents like me, and even a few diplomats had joined the impatient crowd, not wanting to miss the opening of the first ever McDonald’s restaurant in what was still the Soviet Union. A few dozen policemen had been dispatched in case the crowd got out of control.  Reporters gathered around George Cohon, the 52-year-old Canadian who had taken the initiative to bring American fast food to Russia. The rumour was that McDonald’s had avoided the country for political reasons, preferring to let the operator of its franchises north of the U.S. border take the first step. Cohon explained how he had toured Soviet farms – which were still mostly inefficient, and all under state ownership – to find suitable cows to turn into beefburgers. He also imported a special variety of potato, to be grown in Russian fields, which would make the right kind of French fries.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporters feverishly scribbling down these details knew they had a significance beyond ordinary Russians’ appetite for all things American, or their eagerness to devour burgers and Big Macs when the restaurant opened at 10 a.m.  For locals and foreigners alike, the opening was the first physical confirmation, just two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev was serious, if incoherent at times, about economic and political reform. The golden arches signalled that democratisation and liberalisation were irreversible. The proof was in the eating of a Big Mac.  More than three decades later, history has gone into reverse. McDonald’s said this week it would close its 850 restaurants in Russia read more , arguing it could not ignore the “needless human suffering” caused by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Chicago-based company said the closure was temporary, though this seems more of an expression of hope than a plan. McDonald’s said it would still pay its 62,000 Russian employees but acknowledged that it was “impossible to predict when (the restaurants) might be able to reopen.”  McDonald’s no longer has the same scarcity value. Russian diners could until recently get their fast food from a range of outlets including KFC, pizza purveyor Papa John’s , and Burger King, among others. Several of those have now halted their operations or stopped investing in Russia, while coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) has also shut its doors.  Yet for those with longer memories McDonald’s still has symbolic relevance. It was the first major international brand to set up shop in Moscow. Pizza Hut followed a few months later. At the time the USSR had less than two years to live, but it was still hard to imagine that Russia would enter a wild decade of unruly privatisations, that a new caste of oligarchs would take over the country’s mineral resources, or that foreign investors would flock to the Russian capital in search of hefty returns.  In 1990, most Russians were forbidden from holding foreign currencies, so McDonald’s priced its burgers in the non-convertible rouble. The downside was that a Big Mac cost between 2% and 3% of the average Russian’s monthly salary. The equivalent bill in the United States today would be $60.  The price wasn’t a deterrent, though, and McDonald’s served more than 30,000 meals that first day. The Big Mac was not just an exotic food but a taste of the United States, whose brands had been a subject of fascination and envy, and of active black-market trading, in the grim years of the Soviet Union.  The fast-food chain signalled that Russia was joining the globalising world economy, where Russians were at last allowed to travel. A few months before the opening, citizens had congregated in Pushkin Square to use their new-found freedom to demonstrate and express their impatience at the slow pace of reform. Opening a McDonald’s could almost be seen as Gorbachev’s reply to the protesters: See how real all this is.  Today the rapid departure from Russia of Western brands from Apple (AAPL.O) to Zara, combined with the domestic clampdown on citizens’ remaining liberties, shows that none of it was irreversible. These days Pushkin Square is one of the places that the Russian police clears of demonstrators protesting the war in Ukraine. Memories of 1990 are rapidly growing fuzzier.

FFI touts a plethora of potential partnerships, most recently with Airbus(AIR.PA), to produce green hydrogen.  It could take years for many of them to generate revenue, however. For now FFI, will rely on 10% of its parent’s net income to fund roughly $600 million a year of planned outlays. Using Refinitiv estimates, that’ll last three years at best. It could run out sooner if Fortescue Chair Andrew Forrest, who argues the Russian war in Ukraine should accelerate the energy transition, demands more spending.

Now that U.S. President Joe Biden has banned read more imports of Russian oil, one of his problems is how to replace it. One possible source is Venezuela. But the regime of President Nicolás Maduro has been under U.S. sanctions since 2017. Softening them would amount to accepting the lesser of two evils, with Venezuelans as pawns.  U.S. officials visited Caracas read more last weekend, the first such encounter in years, and discussed easing oil-related sanctions. Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-controlled energy giant, has the world’s largest crude reserves. Even though PDVSA’s output has dwindled, it could fairly easily replace the 245 million barrels of crude oil and related products that America sourced from Russia in 2021. That was 8% of total U.S. imports according to Energy Information Administration data.  The talks made little headway, according to Reuters. Still, in one hint of a thaw in relations, the White House said on Tuesday that two Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were returning to the United States. Yet the idea of dealing with Maduro is fraught with political and moral tension, in addition to the irony that America's imports of Russian crude largely replaced what came from Venezuela until sanctions kicked in.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Maduro, a socialist who succeeded Hugo Chávez, has presided over the evaporation of three-quarters of Venezuela’s economic output since 2014 as well as the exodus of nearly a fifth of the population, which now numbers nearly 30 million. The United States recognizes opposition leader Juan Guaidó, not Maduro, as Venezuela’s legitimate president. And U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Monday that purchasing Venezuelan oil could perpetuate the humanitarian crisis there. “We should not breathe new life into [Maduro's] reign of torture and murder,” Menendez said in a statement.  Replacing Russian oil is, however, vital to limit the surge in U.S. gasoline prices, another political concern for Biden. Alternatives to Venezuela include Iran, which is under international sanctions for its nuclear ambitions and therefore raises similar concerns. The easiest option might be Saudi Arabia, if the kingdom will play ball. Either way, the imperative of taking on Russian President Vladimir Putin is proving a lesson in realpolitik.

The 120 billion euro French group refuses to clarify the fate of its 19% stake in Novatek (NVTK.MM), the Russian oil firm it has partnered with since 2011. If the French president wants to retain his credibility as a strong advocate of sanctions against Russia, he needs his country’s only oil major to play ball.  Rivals BP and Shell (SHEL.L) announced their intention to exit Russia shortly after President Vladimir Putin launched his attack on Ukraine. Arguing that selling the stake now would realise a major loss is hardly convincing. Total’s stake, valued at $11 billion in October, is already worthless. Novatek was a penny stock before trading in its instruments was suspended.  Total has a long history in Russia. Current Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné read more is enthusiastic about Arctic oil and gas reserves. And good taste in the choice of business partners is not a commercial requirement. Novatek is owned by two Russian oligarchs, one of whom, Gennady Timchenko, was hit by recent European Union sanctions due to his close ties to Putin.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Pouyanné’s predecessor, Christophe de Margerie, who initiated the Novatek partnership in 2011, was among the cheerleading Western CEOs who saw Russia as a great place to do business. He died in a 2014 plane accident in Moscow hours after dining with then Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev – and just a few months after Russia had annexed Crimea.  The French government isn’t known for shying away from making its opinions known – and prevailing – in major corporate matters. Although its explicit legal options are limited, it has multiple ways to convince or pressure Total to retreat before its, and France’s, reputation takes too big a hit.  loading  As a company hailing from a hostile country, staying in Russia would also leave Total exposed to the Kremlin’s whims. Ultimately, Moscow will decide whether Total stays or goes, and if the latter, to whom and for how much it sells out. Believing that Total’s Russian past guarantees its future with Putin is a dangerous delusion.  Follow @pirrebri on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Whether it is the move away from an economic system reliant upon hydrocarbons, vanquishing the Covid-19 plague or central banks ending the free-money era, extraordinary shifts are occurring across the planet that will shape markets, corporate finance, politics and economies well beyond the coming year. These are the themes that inform Reuters Breakingviews’ annual book of predictions and prescriptions: “A World in Transition”.  Read PDF  Read online (for mobile)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The extraordinary actions required to drive these epochal trends are being taken now, even if it will be years or even decades before achievements can be meaningfully measured. Inevitable transitions, like the one toward renewable energy, are better embraced than resisted. Investors and entrepreneurs who can adapt to change and its concomitant upheaval will reap the greatest rewards. But they must be prepared to make sacrifices along the way. Without social inclusion, these transformations may lead to violence.  Efforts by governments and companies to reduce carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050 or sooner to limit planetary frying to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will continue to dominate the financial and business landscape in 2022. Switching away from coal, gas and oil is a priority. But every sector, including heavy industries like steel and cement, transportation, agriculture and banking, will soon need to make huge commitments to meet the lofty ambitions of the next generation. Our columnists explore all of these.  At the same time, inflation is less quiescent than in the past couple of decades. Central banks will have to start pulling away the punchbowl, which has broad implications for the cost of capital (it goes up!) and the price of money. Speaking of which, money itself will go through a transformational period as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities try to keep up with the emerging dynamics of crypto and digital currencies.  A third year of the pandemic, with the persistent threat of new, more virulent strains, continues to dramatically accelerate the shift to digital-everything. The winners and losers of this transition will become more evident in 2022. Quasi-monopolies - like Amazon.com in delivery and web-services; Meta (FB.O), the company formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in advertising; and Microsoft (MSFT.O) in workflow – were given extraordinary boosts by state-mandated shutdowns. Governments face a make-or-break year to regulate these multi-trillion-dollar behemoths. Microsoft under Satya Nadella is our pick to manage these headwinds best.  And even as people trickle back to offices, post-pandemic dynamics in communications, training, travel and social interaction are permanently reshaping the workplace and productivity. This has implications for the nature of labour, property, urban planning and beyond. It also poses new challenges to leaders, none of whom were trained at Harvard Business School or INSEAD to run sprawling organisations of employees working individually from home. That’s why we’re predicting predicting high CEO turnover, robot investment bankers and a return to offshore jobs.  The increasingly chilly war between the United States and China will dominate international trade and geopolitics. The kerfuffle over U.S. nuclear-submarine sales to Australia and America’s shambolic retreat from Afghanistan offered glimpses into the fractious nature of the Western alliance. With Xi Jinping set for a third term (if not life) as China’s president, U.S. President Joe Biden has a chance to reach détente of some sort to cooperate on climate change, the pandemic and other priorities. But with Biden’s own party facing a trouncing in November's congressional elections, his hands may be tied. On the plus side, European leadership will have a chance to consolidate as French President Emmanuel Macron likely wins a second term in May, Germany welcomes a new chancellor after 16 years with Angela Merkel at the helm, and Italy chooses its next president.  Success will require extraordinary social inclusion. Governments, companies and taxpayers (especially the richest) have to proactively prepare for the sacrifices that are needed to prevent the earth from scorching, while delivering greater equity, financial inclusion and social justice. Failure to do so will lead to civil unrest or worse. In addition to being terrible for business, that would torpedo more existential goals like limiting global warming, whose deleterious effects will be disproportionately borne by the world’s poor. Here’s hoping the business world and financial markets help guide the way to a fairer, greener and more just society in the year ahead.

Sputnik/Sergey Guneev/Kremlin via REUTERS  MUMBAI, March 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Brexit, trade wars between the United States and China, and Covid-19 have dealt successive knocks to globalisation, and the war in Ukraine is doing fresh damage. The unprecedented speed and severity with which American, European and Russian officials have derailed supply chains is a warning to nations that have just barely emerged from the pandemic.  President Vladimir Putin’s threat read more to cut Europe’s energy supplies and his decree banning exports of certain products and raw materials in response to sanctions is a potent illustration read more of the pitfalls of trusting in free trade. Russian companies can no longer buy semiconductors from the world’s top supplier TSMC and Russian people can’t use their Visa (V.N) and Mastercard overseas. Had Russia not invaded Ukraine, restrictions would not have been applied, and they would be partially wound down if Moscow agrees to withdraw. But for governments worried about being subjected to similar treatment someday, or those simply stuck in the cross-fire, the sight of the West wrecking a G20 economy over the course of just a few weeks gives food for protectionist thought.  During the pandemic, officials facing shortages of key medical equipment or electronics components rushed to onshore or re-route crucial supply chains as much as they could, with mixed success. Now, with Moscow warning of $300 per barrel oil prices and farmers panicking that lack of fertiliser will halve crop yields, this decoupling trend is now likely to accelerate.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Countries cannot quickly reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, so this may spur green transitions as governments ramp up efforts to wean themselves off imported fossil fuels. That’s a good thing, but they are also more likely to slap higher taxes on imported goods to spur local production, roll out more policy favouring domestic champions and scrutinise or halt cross-border deals and investment.  Self-sufficiency also implies more global inefficiency as countries duplicate goods and services better imported, and will further increase the price of key commodities. China’s push for self-reliance, for example, has led to massive overcapacity which it shovels into export markets, a tension that led to the trade war in the first place. If everyone moves in the same direction, they could quickly run out of export customers. Politicians' desire to insulate their economies from overseas ructions is perfectly understandable, and worrying.  Follow @ugalani on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Some, like PayPal (PYPL.O), Exxon Mobil(XOM.N), and LVMH (LVMH.PA) have decided to pull out in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's read more invasion of Ukraine. Others, including Uniqlo, seem to be staying put, for now. There can be reasons to stay in Russia, but they need to be good.  Companies that benefit Moscow's coffers or play to the elite class have the most explicit moral reasons to leave. Exxon and LVMH read more fall into that category, as does Shell (SHEL.L), which issued an apology on Tuesday for buying Russian oil last week. Companies that facilitate transactions, like, Visa (V.N), Mastercard , American Express (AXP.N) and PayPal had little choice but to suspend their businesses.  For some, the latest financial incentives make that outcome easier to live with. A raft of sanctions imposed by Europe, the United States and others may mean directly affected activities grind to a near halt anyway. Longer term, the impact of excluding Russia from big parts of the global economy is surely a blow to the outlook for every Russian business.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The trickier situations arise when ordinary Russians could suffer. Nissan Motor , which sold 53,000 cars in Russia last year, decided to stop exports to the country, per Reuters. So did General Motors (GM.N), though it sells far fewer cars. The Big Four accounting firms – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – said they would leave too. All these companies employ thousands of Russian citizens – KPMG’s decision, for example, will affect some 4,500 partners and staff in Russia and Belarus, Reuters says.  There’s a case for businesses that provide essential mass-market goods to stick around, lest they punish citizens who have no influence over Putin’s actions. Clothing retailer Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing (9983.T), for example, says it wants to continue to give Russian citizens access to cheap clothing.  Yogurt maker Danone's (DANO.PA) products will still be available, too, though the company will not make new investments. Japan Tobacco (2914.T) read more also plans to keep stocking the shelves in Russia. Its tax payments accounted for 1.4% of the Kremlin's budget in 2020, according to Reuters. JT also employs 4,500 people there. McDonald’s, however, said on Tuesday that it will temporarily close restaurants and pause operations in Russia despite having 62,000 employees in the country.  There are few black-and-white cases, and many foreign businesses choosing to remain can make a reasonable argument for their choice. They need to keep updating their thinking, though, or they may find their decision looks less ideal as time goes on.  Follow @thereallsl on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

The European Commission has a plan to replace over 70% of Russian gas imports this year by ramping up liquefied natural gas purchases, green energy and gas storage. But energy freedom will likely come at a cost.  President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been a tragic wake-up call. The 27-nation bloc imported 155 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas from Russia last year, including LNG. That’s equivalent to nearly 40% of its annual gas consumption.  Replacing most Russian gas by next winter will be complicated. The Commission wants to cut 112 bcm of it this year alone, a draft seen by Breakingviews shows. The biggest chunk of the so-called RepowerEU plan, 50 bcm, involves boosting LNG imports.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The EU has more than 200 bcm of capacity to turn LNG into usable gas per year, including UK terminals. Yet Spain and France are not well connected with the rest. And to ensure a European destination for LNG cargoes, which often ship to wherever prices are highest, consumers might have to pay in line with inflated gas prices that have already risen 10-fold in a year. A 20 bcm hike to LNG imports is more realistic, the International Energy Agency suggests.  Other measures are similarly eye-catching. The Commission assumes a 14 bcm saving of gas largely by EU citizens turning down their thermostats by 1 degree Celsius. And its aspiration to replace 20 bcm of gas with accelerated wind and solar projects is three times what the IEA pencils in.  Still, replacing 10 bcm of Russian pipeline gas by importing more fuel from places like Algeria looks doable. And a proposal to ensure that the EU fills up 90% of its gas storages before the winter is a legislative no-brainer. These facilities supply up to 30% of EU gas in winter, but some are controlled by Russian gas giant Gazprom .  RepowerEU will be a stretch, but nations could use state subsidies to limit the impact. Or they could tax windfall profits from energy companies, which the IEA says could raise 200 billion euros this year. But as with Covid-19, the shock will hit EU countries unevenly. The bloc showed unity in the pandemic by pooling resources to fund a 750 billion euro stimulus plan to help badly hit countries. Doing so to deal with an epic energy crisis is a logical next step.

CONTEXT NEWS  - The European Commission is set to unveil on March 8 a plan to drastically reduce European Union dependency on Russian gas.  - The plan envisages replacing 112 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas by year-end, through higher liquefied natural gas purchases, greater usage of wind and solar energy, efficiency measures, and the use of biomethane and other measures, according to a draft seen by Breakingviews. The planned reduction is equivalent to 72% of the EU annual import of Russian pipeline gas, which last year amounted to 155 bcm, including LNG imports, International Energy Agency figures show.  - Other EU measures would ensure a complete elimination of Russian gas usage by 2030, according to the draft.  - Under the Commission proposal, EU states would have to fill up their gas storage facilities by 90% at the beginning of each winter. Storage data shows that these facilities are currently 27% full.  - The Commission is also proposing to suspend some state aid rules to allow member states to compensate citizens and companies for the increase in energy costs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Japanese conglomerate, which abruptly changed chief executives amid a controversial restructuring, wants memory-chip maker Kioxia and controlling owner Bain Capital to revive plans for an initial public offering, but only has so much say with a 41% stake. At least the buyout shop will prioritise maximising value.  Since Kioxia was spun out in 2018 and subsequently yanked a highly anticipated market debut, its fate has largely been eclipsed by the larger Toshiba mess. That may not be the case for much longer: Shimada, who took over from Satoshi Tsunakawa on March 1, is sticking with a breakup plan read more that includes returning up to $2.6 billion to shareholders over the next two years, including from offloading non-core assets such as Kioxia.  Toshiba has conceded the timing for a Kioxia share sale is up to Bain, which led the $19 billion buyout. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has roiled markets, but the chipmaker’s financial performance has improved since U.S. sanctions against Huawei, a major Kioxia customer, disrupted business. In the three months to December, Kioxia swung to a profit from a net loss in the same quarter in 2019.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Moreover, the outlook for NAND memory chip prices, which have been falling since mid-2021, is brightening. Rival Micron (MU.O) said in December it expects demand to rise 30% in 2022 and shipment growth to be stronger over the next six months.  The U.S. company and other peers trade on average at less than 9 times operating profit for the last 12 months, per Refintiv. Applying that multiple to Kioxia's 2021 adjusted operating profit, a roughly comparable figure, implies an enterprise value of nearly $21 billion. Back out Kioxia's net debt as of June 2020 and the equity would be worth around $9 billion. At that valuation, half of Toshiba’s stake would generate $1.9 billion of pre-tax proceeds, potentially helping Shimada exceed the shareholder return target.  Even that may not be enough, given the widespread displeasure over Toshiba’s plan to split and the preference by some that it pursue a potential sale to private equity. Although Toshiba can only await a decision on Kioxia, it is also comfortably safe knowing that Bain’s aim is to make as much money as possible. Toshiba’s shareholders can’t necessarily feel the same about Shimada.  Follow @mak_robyn on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)  CONTEXT NEWS  - Toshiba said on March 1 that Taro Shimada would become chief executive, taking over immediately for Satoshi Tsunkawa, who resigned from the role on the same day. Shimada joined the company in 2018 from Siemens.  - On Feb. 7, the Japanese conglomerate said it would split into two parts instead of the originally planned three and increase shareholder returns to 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) over the next two years, from an earlier target of 100 billion yen, including proceeds from selling non-core assets.  - Toshiba also said it would "monetize shares in Kioxia Holdings Corporation while maximizing shareholders value and return the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practicable". The company, which owns a 40.6% stake in Kioxia, has formally asked the chipmaker to conduct an initial public offering as early as possible. Investment funds controlled by private equity firm Bain Capital own a majority stake in Kioxia.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/  LONDON, March 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As its name implies, Rusal (RUAL.MM) is heavily Russian and heavily into aluminium. Trying to keep in with Western investors by carving out its non-Russian bits, as parent company En+ is contemplating read more , looks like a challenge. Its chairman, former British cabinet minister Greg Barker, quit on Monday, perhaps with a view to lead the new offshoot.  The spinoff plan, according to the Times, appears to be to create a clean break with En+’s 44% owner Oleg Deripaska and any Russian assets. Rusal’s non-Russian bauxite mines contain an impressive 1.3 billion tonnes of reserves and boast ore-processing plants in countries including Ukraine, Jamaica and Ireland. The problem is that most of its profit comes from smelting aluminium, and most of that is done on Russian soil. Assuming non-Russian assets account for nearly 10% of EBITDA, in line with the 2020 results, and the international offshoot might generate $320 million of EBITDA this year. On a 4 times multiple, akin to big miners, the enterprise would be worth just $1.3 billion. Even then, investors may still be wary of any business that was once so closely linked to Russia.

Just the prospect of a ban on Western imports of Russian oil catapulted the price of a barrel of Brent crude to $139 on Monday, its highest since 2008. Surging energy and commodity costs mean high inflation is inevitable. Economic stagnation or recession, the other half of the "stagflation" spectre, is more avoidable.  The euro zone is particularly dependent on Russian energy and is therefore the most exposed to stagflation risks, though the United States isn't immune. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate a sustained $20 rise in oil prices would erode euro zone GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points this year. If Russian natural gas stopped flowing, an additional 2.2 percentage points would be lopped off, they say. That would put paid to most of the economic expansion expected by the European Commission, which in February forecast growth of 4% for 2022.  Such an outcome wouldn’t be as bad as the pandemic-driven economic collapse in 2020. And governments can mitigate the shock, just as they did then. They can shield the poorest in society from surging food and heating costs by increasing payouts to the unemployed and to low-income households. Finance ministers can reduce taxes on energy and food products or on a range of consumer goods. They also have the option to defer tax hikes, like the one that’s planned in April by Britain’s Rishi Sunak.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  That said, governments face different challenges this time. First, high inflation means central banks are, for now, going to be raising interest rates to tighten financial conditions rather than easing them. Second, the public sector is already burdened with borrowing from Covid-19 measures. General government debt in advanced economies hit 122.7% of GDP in 2020, up nearly a fifth from the previous year, and has only retreated slightly since, according to the International Monetary Fund.  There’s also a cost to doing nothing: lower growth and rising unemployment would mean more people in economic distress and higher welfare outlays. Meanwhile, governments would pay a political price in forthcoming elections for high fuel prices if they do nothing, though more borrowing may also be unwelcome. Resisting economic stagnation means accepting yet more Big Government.  Follow @swahapattanaik on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)  Crises past and present  CONTEXT NEWS  - Oil prices on March 7 surged to their highest levels since 2008 as the United States and its European allies considered banning Russian oil imports.

The repercussions of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are winding the clock back in a matter of weeks. It’s a real-time test of how a nation copes when Western technology, capital and consumer goods are suddenly cut off.  The speed with which Russia has unplugged from the developed world is breathtaking. Economic sanctions and public outrage are compelling big companies like Apple (AAPL.O), Nike and Ikea to halt Russian sales read more . Shipping groups have suspended container traffic while international air travel has stopped. Oil giants and global accounting firms are pulling out. Moody’s, which last week deemed Russian government debt worthy of an investment grade rating, now says the country is at risk of default read more .  The rupture is deliberate. Financial sanctions imposed by America, Europe and Japan exposed big weaknesses in Putin’s economic defences, disabling as much as half the country’s $630 billion stash of foreign exchange reserves and triggering a run on the rouble read more . Restrictions on exports of computers, telecoms kit and aircraft parts will hobble Russian industry, which has been increasingly enmeshed into global supply chains. Putin and his officials have responded by preventing capital from leaving the country, abruptly severing intricate financial links.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Ambiguity over the reach of sanctions – and the possibility of further measures – have magnified their disruptive impact. Technology suppliers have stopped fulfilling orders while their lawyers work out what’s permitted. And though Western countries are currently still allowed to buy Russian oil and gas, buyers risk a backlash, as Shell (SHEL.L) found after picking up a discounted cargo of crude on Friday read more . Banks and payments providers are wary of transferring cash, even if sanctions do not apply.  Putin has ways to limit the damage. Russia’s need for foreign capital is limited as exports have exceeded imports every year since 1998 due to overseas sales of energy, which the International Monetary Fund reckons contributed roughly 11% of GDP last year. While the United States is now discussing an oil embargo and Europe plans to rapidly kick its Russian gas habit, China and India may over time prove more willing buyers of Russian hydrocarbons. And the People’s Republic – already Russia’s largest trade partner – can supply some of the electronics and machinery that the West will no longer deliver. Such a pivot will take years, however.  This is not the only example of globalisation going backwards. The United States has in recent years become more hostile to Chinese investment, while the People’s Republic wants to depend less on U.S. technology. This has prompted suggestions that the two economies could decouple entirely. Meanwhile, the global pandemic has forced governments to reconsider their reliance on distant suppliers for everything from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors. Pariah states like Iran have operated under various types of U.S.-led sanctions for decades, while North Korea has been pursuing self-sufficiency since the 1950s. But no large country has completely exited the global trade and financial system that emerged after the Cold War.  The consequences of Russia’s reverse globalisation are therefore hard to predict. In the short term, life will get worse. Putin’s government can ramp up domestic production of some goods, but others are impossible to replace in the short term. Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N), which have stopped delivering spare parts and servicing aircraft in Russia, supplied all but nine of flag carrier Aeroflot’s (AFLT.MM) 186-strong fleet. Russia struggles to make its own semiconductors, so products from cars to mobile phone equipment will become scarce. Businesses that use software provided by the likes of SAP (SAPG.DE) and Oracle (ORCL.N), which have both halted sales and support, will have to rethink their systems.  Increasing isolation will widen an economic gap that 30 years of globalisation has failed to close. Russian citizens on average produced about three times as much economic output in real terms in 2020 as three decades earlier, but wealthier Western economies did at least as well, according to World Bank data. In 1990, America’s output per head of population was almost seven times Russia’s; in 2020, the ratio was still over six times.  Many Russians will therefore barely register the disappearance of BMW , Netflix or Johnnie Walker. Nevertheless, they have become unwilling participants in a real-time test of what happens when a country tries to rewind globalisation at warp speed. Whether Russians are willing to accept the consequences will help determine whether Putin continues his deadly assault on Ukraine, or whether he is eventually forced to back down.

A decision by Singapore to sanction certain Russia banks and transactions, despite no binding resolution from the U.N. Security Council, is a bold move for the typically neutral financial centre. It spotlights Moscow’s shrinking economic ground in Asia.  The small city-state has little to lose as it stands up against what its foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan calls “might is right” geopolitics. The direct financial relationship with Russia is tiny. Nor will siding with the West on Ukraine immediately irk China, Singapore’s top trading partner. President Xi Jinping is busy minimising the fallout read more from Putin’s actions, which Beijing refuses to condemn, on China’s Belt and Road infrastructure projects in eastern European countries.  Yet the sanctions, targeting four Russian banks and including an export ban on electronics, computers and military items, is a blow to Moscow’s effort to turn its decade-long pivot to Asia into something that goes beyond just China. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, bilateral trade with the People’s Republic has grown by more than 50%; last year’s figure hit a record $147 billion, per Chinese customs data. Notably, no other major Asian nation features in Russia’s top five trading partners.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Moscow’s unease with its growing reliance on China is matched by persistent efforts to nurture relationships elsewhere. As recently as December, Russia was cheering progress towards a free trade agreement between Singapore and the Eurasian Economic Union. As a gateway to Southeast Asia, the city state was poised to serve as a valuable hub for Russian exports, including food grains. That’s likely to go on pause.  Singapore joins Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to announce sanctions in the region. But even in Asian countries that haven’t taken sides read more , the rising influence of U.S.-led alliances like the Quad and the Indo-Pacific is curbing Russia’s market opportunity for non-energy exports. Take India, for example. Russian exporters have long supported its efforts to build nuclear power plants and a weapons arsenal. The United States, however, is increasingly cooperating with New Delhi in these areas too. As sanctions bite, Asia will not make for an easy Russian fallback.

"An aerial bomb on a maternity hospital is the conclusive evidence that what is happening is a genocide of Ukrainians," he said in his nightly video address.  The airstrike on the hospital left three people dead, including a child, and more than a dozen injured.  "There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless," U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted. He said the country is "exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes."  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba Wednesday about additional security and humanitarian assistance the U.S. could provide Ukraine in the face of Russia's "unconscionable attacks harming population centers," a State Department spokesperson said.

China has remained largely supportive of Russia amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine, but that support has a breaking point, according to one expert.  "China has been cheerleading, and enabling … and protecting the Russians," James Carafano, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital.  But if China faced harsh penalties in the form of tariffs, that would change.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I think the Chinese would totally throw the Russians under the bus," Carafano said. "Second, it creates a pain point for China."  Putin's error  Experts have said that Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the resistance his military would receive from Ukraine, which led to a drawn-out invasion now entering its third week.  UN PASSES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE; CHINA ABSTAINS  Just this week, China’s foreign minister touted the country’s relationship with Russia as its "most important strategic partner."  "No matter how perilous the international landscape, we will maintain our strategic focus and promote the development of a comprehensive China-Russia partnership in the new era ," Wang Yi told reporters Monday at a news conference of the annual meeting of China’s ceremonial parliament.  "The friendship between the two peoples is ironclad."  ‘Clear indication’ where CCP stands  Heino Klinck, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital this week that China’s comment is a "pretty clear indication" as to "where the Chinese Communist Party stands."  CHINA REMAINS ‘ALL IN FOR PUTIN,’ CHINESE-RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICIES ARE ‘HIGHLY COORDINATED,’ GORDON CHANG SAYS  "The Chinese do have a strategic partnership and are unified by the fact that they're both opposed to a world in which America maintains a key, if not the pivotal, leadership role," he said.  Klinck said China is caught between not leaving Russia "in a lurch," while also protecting itself from "being painted with the same brush as North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus."  The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last week condemning Russia’s invasion, with 141 nations voting in support of the resolution. China was among the 35 nations that abstained from voting, while Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria voted against the resolution.  PUTIN'S MISCALCULATION: RUSSIA UNDERESTIMATED THE UKRAINIANS' RESOLVE AND WESTERN BACKLASH, EXPERTS SAY  Eyes on Taiwan?  Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, speculation has mounted about whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will take the opportunity to invade Taiwan.  China views Taiwan, which sits off the coast of mainland China, as a breakaway province that will one day be a part of the country. Taiwan operates as an independent country.  As Xi likely weighs whether to invade Taiwan, the strength of his military will also come into play.  Russia is grappling with a fledgling invasion as the Ukrainians continue battling their foe, leaving an estimated 3,000 Russian soldiers dead. Carafano said Russia is showing that "no matter how incompetent [the Russian military is], they're really good at killing civilians."  "It doesn't matter that they can't end wars. They've demonstrated that they're willing to start them ... lots of destruction and death, lots of refugees," he said, noting no one should view the war as proof the Russian miliary is not a problem.  CHINA TOUTS 'FRIENDSHIP' WITH RUSSIA: 'MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER'  Carafano said China has a similar issue with its military. It hasn't gotten into any wars to demonstrate its aptitude.  "The Chinese military has similar problems to the Russians in that they actually haven't fought wars. And if you actually look at the Chinese operations on the border with India, they're not terribly impressive. The Chinese haven't actually demonstrated the capacity to do large-scale military operations," Carafano said.  Nations sometimes need to be "more thoughtful about deterring reckless, incompetent people than deterring competent enemies," Carafano said.  Since Russia launched its Ukraine invasion, more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, according to the U.N.

The office estimated the real figures are actually higher.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez refused to respond when asked what she would say to Americans who are facing record prices at the gas pump. In a video obtained by Fox News, the second-term congresswoman walked away when asked if she supported expanding U.S. energy production to help alleviate record-high gas prices.  In the video, Ocasio-Cortez ignored questions requesting her perspective on President Biden's sanctions against Russia, his administration's ban on Russian oil, as well the high cost of gasoline. Ocasio-Cortez continued on to her dinner at Bullfeathers, a restaurant just across the street from the U.S. Capitol building, with her colleague Rep. Mondaire Jones.

The Ukraine crisis may be a story of Russian aggression, but the preamble is the Biden administration’s total failure to strengthen America industrially and economically, rally the West, bolster NATO, and deter Vladimir Putin.  Weeks of sanction threats didn’t stop Putin. Rather, President Biden’s teleprompter sermons provided time for the amassing of offensive forces on the Ukraine border.  I attended the Munich Security Conference in late February, along with a bipartisan array of my House and Senate colleagues. The administration was there, too, but provided nothing close to definitive policy. The clearest statements they made publicly or privately were that if you are an American citizen in Ukraine and find yourself trapped in a war zone, well, you’re on your own.  BIDEN'S FAILURES BY THE NUMBERS – ENERGY COSTS, POLL NUMBERS TELL THE STORY  The culmination of this White House’s missteps: A 65-minute phone call between Biden and Putin. Less than two weeks later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and the killing began.  Biden’s response? A lot of words. Some at high volume. Others at a low whisper. But the out-loud contemplation of sanctions is a poor substitute for leading the nation and world.  Many thought the State of the Union Address would be different. It wasn’t. It was empty cheerleading. Take Biden’s full-throated assurance that Putin "will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people."  We know he meant to say "Ukrainian" people. But the statement makes no more sense with the correction. Who can possibly think at this point that Putin is trying to win the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people? He’s trying to take their country and their freedom.  I’ve attended 17 State of the Union addresses. I’ve never seen one that was followed by less action from a White House. It’s now been seven days since Biden’s national address. No legislation. No Cabinet-level Hill consultation. No bipartisan White House gathering.  The Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine.  This brings us to Tuesday’s announcement by President Biden to restrict Russian energy imports weeks after my colleagues and I urged him to do so. The policy move is fine, but his remarks were defensive, divisive and, quite frankly, dishonest.  He did not in any way advance the national interest or our international standing. And it is simply not true – as he said – that this administration is doing all it can to lessen the pain that Americans are feeling at the pump, from their utility bills, and in their inflation-battered pocketbooks.  It’s dishonest for the White House to link the inflation its policies skyrocketed – and the gas prices it drove up just as fast – to the crisis in Ukraine. This is a naked attempt to offload its failures onto what it hopes will be a sharing of blame with others.  The truth is, the Biden administration had already plunged this country into an energy crisis before Putin mobilized soldiers for this invasion of Ukraine. From his first days in office, President Biden stopped energy infrastructure and sent an unmistakable message to the energy industry: no to pipelines, no to drilling, no to the financing of oil and gas projects. This was a stunning reversal of the energy independence policies that were working when he took office as oil production exceeded consumption for most of 2019 and 2020.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER  Has the White House looked to our country for a solution? Just the opposite. It is beseeching OPEC and Venezuela to produce more crude. Is Iran next? The administration repeatedly suggests the use of renewables that have no capacity to help us right now and for struggling consumers to buy the electric cars they can’t afford.  It's a shame that this White House is so captive to its progressive base and invested in its Green New Deal promises to turn to the best of America.  The Congress stands ready to support real measures. But the only administration source heading to the Hill this week is the State Department’s undersecretary for political affairs.

Enough. There is no substitute for presidential action, and Biden has been a bystander long enough. Here’s hoping President Biden will address the nation soon with depth, insight and solutions. He certainly hasn’t done it yet.

Journalists, pundits and liberal celebrities alike have offered an onslaught of energy takes as the Russia-Ukraine crisis unfolds and surging gas prices cause pain at the pump for average Americans.  Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2007-09 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon – the highest average to date, according to AAA. To combat the shocking price increase, many have echoed White House talking points lecturing Americans to buy more electric cars. Other liberal pundits have insisted Americans should simply eliminate oil dependence altogether without offering a viable alternative.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  As a result, NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck said "few stories will do a better job of exposing the almost impenetrable bubble of the far-left and their celebrity pals" than coverage of gas prices and energy costs that is currently dominating the news cycle.  "It's not just tone deaf, but demeaning and insulting for them to almost celebrate the lack of adequate oil supply and sky-high prices at the pump," Houck told Fox News Digital. "Contrary to their worldview, working men and women aren't able to have the funds to foot the bill for a Telsa or electric car or accountant to find them the massive tax breaks. No matter what they say, viewers will see right through these smug pleas to 'go green.'"  TOM COTTON: JOE BIDEN’S POLICY ON OIL AND GAS IS ‘ALMOST A FARCE’  ‘A lot of talk’  On Tuesday, MSNBC’s Katy Tur responded to President Biden banning Russian oil by pondering aloud why we simply don’t "go green" and ditch the need to foreign oil to truly hurt the Kremlin.  "We only use about 8%. Again, our allies would need to get involved, because so much of Europe is dependent on Russian oil," Tur responded. "It’s also something that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut brought up today was this just exposes how insane it is that we rely — we rely on energy from authoritarian leaders, and we are not self-reliant on our own energy. A lot of talk about why we don’t go green."  WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE'  On the same episode of "Katy Tur Reports," NPR’s Roben Farzad suggested this crisis was in part due to Americans not learning any "lessons" from the high gas prices of 2008, by continuing to buy large trucks instead of electric vehicles.  "Look around you, Katy. Everybody is driving a big pickup truck, SUVs, gigantic SUVs are back in vogue. We talk a big game, but this happens time and time again to the U.S. consumer," he griped, adding that he didn't want to come across as "some blue checkmark lecturing people in a time of pain."  Farzad also faulted consumers for complaining about gas prices.  "Time and time again, the United States consumer is saying, ‘Well, I'm in pain. What can we do?' And we seemingly take the easy answer out every time," he told Tur.  "Time and time again, the United States consumer is saying, ‘Well, I'm in pain. What can we do?' And we seemingly take the easy answer out every time." — Roben Farzad, NPR  The conversations on MSNBC came the day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday said the American people stand to benefit from having more electric vehicles on the road but failed to elaborate on how they could become more affordable. While touting the benefits of clean transportation, Buttigieg remarked that Americans from "rural to suburban to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings of driving an EV."  Although the cost of electric vehicles has come down in recent years, they still remain out of reach for millions of Americans, with an average price hovering around $50,000.  Colbert slammed as ‘elitist’  CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert apparently got Buttigieg’s memo, but was widely slammed for remarks made Tuesday on "The Late Show."  "Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high over $4 per gallon. OK, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla," Colbert said.  His comments were criticized as "elitist" coming from a comedian earning $15 million a year.  Last week, ABC News’ "The View" touched on the subject when co-host Sunny Hostin called for Americans to "uptick our oil supply" despite climate issues because of the ongoing humanitarian crisis. However, co-host Sara Haines declared we need to eliminate oil dependence altogether.  "We have to take away our dependence on oil. This is one thing that when we talk about getting clean energy in this country everyone says, ‘Oh, here go the environmentalists again,’ This is why we have to get off. It's not sustainable," Haines said.  "It makes us dependent on the Middle East. It makes us dependent on places like Russia," she continued. "If people don’t get serious about the fact that's not an environmental issue, it’s an economic issue, it’s a national security issue."  MSNBC GUEST: HIGH GAS PRICES WILL FORCE AMERICANS TO ACCEPT ‘THE TRUTH’ OF GREEN ENERGY  CNN: ‘OK with paying higher prices’  CNN’s Vanessa Yurkevich said on Tuesday that Americans are "OK" with spending more at the pump if it "holds Russia accountable" for invading Ukraine.  "If you look at it globally, if the European Union decides to do something similar as to what President Biden is going to be doing in his announcement," she said prior to Biden’s official announcement.  "Stopping all Russian imports and energy into the country. That could have a significant ripple effect on the global energy market, then pushing prices here at home at the pump a lot higher," Yurkevich said. "People we’ve spoken to over the last couple weeks, they’re OK with paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for what they are doing in Ukraine."  When Biden announced the ban on Russian oil, he also defended his environmental policies and regulations that obstructed domestic oil production.  "It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production, that’s simply not true," Biden stated.  STEPHEN COLBERT KNOCKED FOR DOWNPLAYING GAS PRICES: ‘A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IS WORTH A BUCK OR TWO’  In live coverage afterward, "CBS Mornings" co-anchor Gayle King repeated the president’s claim.  "He also made it clear… that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too," King said.  CBS senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang then cited the White House's excuses, blaming oil companies instead of Biden’s policies.  "Right, because that’s what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we can’t just ramp up oil production here. Well, the president just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right," Jiang said.  ‘Wind’ from Bette Midler  Far-left actress Bette Midler tweeted, "Since the Russian invasion, the cost to produce wind energy has gone up $0.00," prompting critics to explain to the privileged actress that cars cannot run on wind.  "Show me the cars and airplanes and trucks and trains that can use wind power. And apparently it does not cost anything to build the windmills and infrastructure to harness the energy," conservative pundit Carmine Sabia responded.  Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson feels the Green agenda is a "danger to our national security" itself.  "Maybe decades from now we will have the technology to replace fossil fuels, but until then it is reckless to leave ourselves vulnerable. The Green agenda also is elitist, ignoring the costs imposed on working class people from higher gasoline and heating sources," Jacobson told Fox News Digital.  ‘Significant, of course’  Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki continued to shield Biden from fuel-related criticism Wednesday as she was grilled on whether Americans simply need to wait until 2030 – the year that Biden has set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – in order to combat gas surges.  "No, that has never been our theory or our belief, I would say that since President Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian border, the price of gas at the pump in America has gone up 75 cents, which is significant, of course," Psaki said during a news briefing.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Psaki said it is widely believed that the buildup of Putin’s troops along the Ukraine border has caused many of the issues that occurred during Biden’s time in the White House.  "The reality, as you know, is that Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer and energy supply disruptions and market volatility are the result of his aggressions," she continued. "We need to ensure the supply meets the demand out there in the marketplace. There's a couple of ways to do that. Obviously, we're engaging with big global oil producers around the world to meet that demand. But there are also, as we've talked about a few times in here, 9,000 unused oil leases that oil companies could certainly tap into. And we've encouraged them to do that."

EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump told Fox News that President Biden is "letting the radical climate extremists run our country while the world burns," as gas prices in the U.S. surge to record highs amid Russia’s war against Ukraine.  "Energy prices are skyrocketing — they are going to infinity, all because of Joe Biden," Trump told Fox News.  Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2007-09 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon — the highest average to date, according to AAA.  Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the "main artery" of Russia's economy amid Putin’s war on Ukraine, but warned that the ban would cost American families.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russian oil exports account for about one-third of Europe’s oil imports, however, Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports.  "This was a war that should have never happened," Trump told Fox News. "There is no way Putin would have done it if I were president."  Bipartisan heat  Biden has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for the high gas prices, which have risen sharply under his administration even before Russia’s invasion. Many have publicly called for him to open up oil and gas drilling in the U.S. to lessen the country’s dependence on foreign oil.  WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE'  "We have the oil under our feet, liquid gold," Trump said. "But instead, we are thinking of buying oil from Venezuela, Iran and others who do not exactly love America."  "We have the oil under our feet, liquid gold. But instead, we are thinking of buying oil from Venezuela, Iran and others who do not exactly love America." — Former President Trump  Trump was reacting to reports that the Biden administration is weighing purchasing petroleum from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  "Joe Biden is letting the radical climate extremists run our country, while the world burns," Trump told Fox News. "Everyone is suffering because our leaders have no idea what they are doing."  Trump added: "Bring back American energy independence and American dominance."  Blaming Putin  The former president’s comments came as the White House is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for the record-high gas prices in the U.S., even coining the surge as the "#PutinPriceHike," and vowing that Biden will do everything he can to shield Americans from "pain at the pump."  On Wednesday, though, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said restarting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was not one of the options on the table.  "If we’re trying to bring about more supply that does not address any problem," Psaki said. "The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism – it’s not an oil field, so it does not provide more supply into the system."  When pressed further on whether restarting the pipeline is something the White House is considering, Psaki said: "There’s no plans for that, and it would not address any of the problems we’re having currently."  GOP criticism  Biden has been facing criticism from Republicans, who have been urging him to lift his executive orders that canceled the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands.  WHITE HOUSE: 'NO PLANS' TO ALLOW KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE, DESPITE SAYING ALL OPTIONS ON TABLE FOR OIL PRICES  Biden, this week, though, said it is "not true" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, warning that gas prices will "go up further" from their current record levels, and reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticizing the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S.  Biden was asked Tuesday if he had a message for the American people on gas prices.  "They’re going to go up," he said.  TRUMP WARNS 'WORLD WAR' COULD BE NEXT AS RUSSIA CONTINUES INVASION IN UKRAINE  When asked what is he going to do about it, Biden replied: "Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible."  Trump's warning  Meanwhile, during a separate interview with Fox News last month just days after Russia launched its multi-front war on Ukraine, Trump said the invasion could lead to "world war."  "Thousands of people, I mean, this can lead to much bigger than this one area," Trump warned. "This could lead to a lot of other countries and can lead to world war."

President Biden and White House officials were quick to claim credit for a dip in gas prices in December, but now that gas prices are soaring to record-high levels, the administration is disclaiming responsibility.  Biden said on Dec. 21, 2021 that he "was able to bring [gas prices] down 12 cents a gallon,"adding they "will come down more, I believe."  At the time, gas prices hovered around $3.30 a gallon (which was still nearly a dollar higher than when Biden took office), according to data from GasBuddy.  BIDEN'S MISLEADING SPIN ABOUT OIL PRODUCTION UNDER HIM VS. TRUMP  Just days before that, White House officials had circulated a memo among reporters touting the president's "aggressive actions" to combat price increases, which they linked to a 10-cent drop in gas prices.  But prices soon resumed climbing. By Feb. 8, the national average had climbed over $3.45, according to AAA.  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine – and Biden's subsequent ban on all Russian energy imports – pushed high gas prices even higher.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The national average now sits at $4.30, and in California it's rapidly approaching $5.60, according to data from GasBuddy.  Unlike in December, the Biden administration isn't taking responsibility for gas prices.  Biden on Tuesday said it is "not true" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, while warning that the United States’ ban of Russian oil imports will "cost" American families.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When asked later on Tuesday about gas prices, Biden acknowledged they're "going to go up."  He added: "Can't do much right now. Russia is responsible."

"We're not getting our gas from here, we're definitely getting it from other countries," a mother named Kay told Fox News.  "We have the tools to provide [oil] for our own country," she continued.  US COULD INCREASE GAS EXPORTS TO HELP EUROPE MOVE AWAY FROM RUSSIAN ENERGY, CEO SAYS  ‘We shouldn’t be dependent'  "We shouldn't be dependent on another country for our gas," another man named William said.  Oil and gas products used by American consumers should be made here in the U.S. instead of Russia, he added.  The U.S. imported nearly 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Russia last year, according to statement the White House.  Another Maryland man said, "We're going to change our way of thinking because right now, you're coming out with your pockets drained."  ‘Why can’t we produce our own oil?'  "This Keystone pipeline, it runs from Canada all the way down through here. Why can't we produce our own oil?" Richie asked. "Why do we have to buy anything?"  "Increase our environmental standards, make sure they're enforced and pump our own oil," Richie continued.  AMERICANS REACT TO RECORD GAS PRICES: 'YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM INFLATION'  The average price of diesel fuel in the United States reached $5 per gallon on Wednesday, according to gas price tracking service GasBuddy.

If he wanted to, he could very well tap it" he said.  The White House already stated that the Strategic Petroleum Reserves have been tapped.  "We should drill our own, but I think we need to just lean away from gas all together with our automobiles," Seitu said. "I mean, with the electric cars and battery-powered cars, I think that's going to be the new way."  Adam Sabes contributed to this report

EXCLUSIVE: In the wake of WNBA star Brittney Griner’s detention in Russia, U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Burgess Owens, R-Utah, have called on the Biden administration to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, letting him know Americans will not be held as political pawns in the midst of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.  Donalds and Burgess, in a letter to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken – and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital – acknowledged Griner may have violated Russian law but wrote that her detention since sometime in February was concerning given the deteriorating geopolitical climate.  "Today, we write to you regarding the unfortunate case of Women's National Basketball Association (W.N.B.A) star Center Brittney Griner who remains in a Russian prison for violating the country's illegal substance laws," the Congress members wrote. "Every American – regardless of their race, gender, or socioeconomic status – must adhere to the rules of every sovereign nation. While we are not here to call balls and strikes on Russian law, we are very concerned about Mrs. Griner’s detention under the current and rapidly deteriorating circumstances in Russia and Eastern Europe.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  ‘Slap in the face’  "While Mrs. Griner made a grave mistake, we condemn the Russian government’s utilization of her as a pawn to further their ruthless and sick goal of fulfilling the reincarnation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). We call upon your administration to look Putin in the eyes and send a clear message to the Kremlin that America will not tolerate Putin using Americans as his pawn during this treacherous and bleak moment in world history. Putin's unprovoked and murderous attack on Ukraine is a slap in the face to the Western world, and it is time that the United States stands up to this bully. Mrs. Griner has proudly represented our country here at home and on the world stage, becoming one of the few W.N.B.A players to win a college championship, W.N.B.A and Euroleague titles, and an Olympic gold medal — and we urge the safe return of Mrs. Griner and any other Americans detained in Putin’s hellhole of a country."

Griner could face up to a decade in prison if she’s convicted.  ‘Freedom must always prevail’  "In closing, it is more apparent than ever that actions have consequences, but no American should fall hostage to a heinous and deranged dictator," they added. "As Ukraine continues to fight for its freedom valiantly, the United States of America must send a message to the world that freedom must always prevail and that no American will be left behind. We pray for Ukraine and the safe return of Brittney Griner."  BRITTNEY GRINER'S ARREST PHOTO SURFACES DAYS AFTER DETENTION REPORT  Donalds serves Florida’s 19th Congressional District and sits on the House Budget Committee, Oversight and Reform Committee and Small Business Committee. He won his congressional election in 2020 with 61.2% of the vote.  Owens, a former NFL player and Super Bowl champion, serves Utah's 4th Congressional District. He sits on the Education and Labor Committee and Judiciary Committee.  WNBA and Olympic champion  Griner is one of the biggest basketball stars in either the men’s or women’s game. She’s a seven-time WNBA All-Star and one-time WNBA champion who is set to play her 10th season for the Phoenix Mercury this summer.  Griner has also won two Olympic gold medals playing for Team USA.

As the war in Ukraine continues, Pastor Andrew Moroz of Lynchburg, Virginia — a Ukrainian American who has family and friends still in Ukraine — told Fox News Digital that a woman named Ana whom he knows sent him a tearful message from a Ukrainian village just a few days ago, saying, "I don’t want to leave [my home]. Please pray. My heart is breaking."  The woman is traveling with her 83-year-old mother and is trying to dodge bombs and bullets.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  She and her family don't feel they are being "liberated" by the Russians — they are being "displaced," she said, from their home country, as Pastor Moroz relayed to Fox News Digital.  "Jesus reserved some of his harshest words for people who bring harm to children."  Moroz also said, "Before the [Russian] invasion, Ana was free to work; she enjoyed her friends and her church. Now ordinary citizens like her are being forced to leave. Russia is creating an international crisis and destroying lives."  UKRAINE REFUGEES POUR ACROSS THE WESTERN BORDER  Moroz added that Ana and her family have been at the Hungarian border for at least the last 24 hours. What is next for them, no one really knows.  He also said he's received messages from people in Ukraine about the rising number of child casualties amid this war.  He told Fox News Digital, "Jesus reserved some of his harshest words for people who bring harm to children — see Matthew 18:6," for example, he said. (In that passage, Jesus says, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.")  LENT'S EMBER DAYS: RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR POINTS TO NEED FOR RECONCILIATION  Pastor Moroz also said simply, "Pray for Ukraine. Pray for those who are grieving loss."  He said a friend in Kyiv "asked us to pray for her daughters and [for all the] women, children and individuals who are handicapped." On Wednesday, they were to be evacuated, "but the heavy shooting has been nonstop. They are [still] waiting in the basement of the church."  ‘Faith communities’ are ‘fighting for what is right’  Rabbi Tuly Weisz, of Beit Shemesh, Israel, spoke to Fox News Digital on Wednesday from the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) Christian Media convention in Nashville, Tennessee, this week.  "In addition to this being an enormous humanitarian crisis," he said, "the Jewish people are very concerned because there's so much history in that region. My grandmother is from Ukraine, originally."  "I live in Israel, where there are literally hundreds of thousands of Israelis from Russia and Ukraine," the rabbi continued. "But in addition to that, there's a very interesting spiritual message [here]. Both Jews and Christians are looking at this [war] from a biblical perspective. A lot of rabbis are saying how this seems to be the war that is described in the end of days."  EVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE GRATEFUL FOR HELP, PRAYERS  Rabbi Weisz said he believes, despite this enormous tragedy, that the one "silver lining" may be that "different faith communities [are] coming into alignment, and together they are fighting for what's right."  He said his organization has raised more than $100,000 for rescue efforts in Ukraine. A team member, he added, is right now at the border of Ukraine and Moldova assisting the displaced.  ‘Complete separation from what is right and good’  Shane Williamson, president and CEO of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, in Kansas City, Missouri, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, "Our thoughts and prayers extend to the entire nation of Ukraine. As the world watches the inconceivable act of aggression in the invasion of Ukraine, may the followers of Jesus commit [themselves] more than ever to the Gospel."  He said that "these types of aggressions spotlight the depravity that humanity can reach when sin has fully grown and gives birth to death (James 1:15)."  He also said, "This is a complete separation from what is right and good, the value of life, and the inalienable right for freedom."  "We are asking God to deliver Ukraine from evil. May he have mercy and heal this land."  Williamson said as well, "We are asking God to deliver Ukraine from evil. May he have mercy and heal this land. May he give Ukraine peace and the chance to develop as a nation that values truth, justice and freedom — rooted in the goodness of God."  ‘Pray for peace … We all need Jesus’  Ed Vitagliano, executive vice president of the American Family Association in Tupelo, Mississippi, shared a message about the "tragedy" that is occurring in Ukraine.  "This tragedy in Europe seems to have awakened many people to the reality of evil," he said Wednesday. "They see that human wickedness can be brutal and causes so much human suffering."  He added, "In response, it is a good thing to see so many Christians in America heartbroken and praying for their brothers and sisters in Ukraine."  Vitagliano said his organization "encourages the church here and abroad to not only pray for peace in Ukraine and for the Ukrainians, but also for the Russian people. We all need Jesus — and the power of the Gospel is the true source of hope."  ‘Focus of our faith is greater than even a mortal shell'  Judge Phil Ginn, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, "All across America and the world, the hearts of people of faith are breaking as the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people continue to unfold."  In addition, he said, "There is certainly an added degree of stress from the fear of the unknown and of certain real economic repercussions that have affected us directly, even in America."  Ginn also said, "At the same time, we at Southern Evangelical Seminary have heard and been encouraged by heroic stories of some of our own graduates who are on the ground lending medical aid and spiritual comfort to those whose world has been torn apart by this senseless act of evil aggression."  "While political leaders look in vain for a credible solution," Ginn added, "Christ followers know that the focus of our faith is greater than even a mortar shell, much less some dollar amount shown on a gas pump in America."

President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24 after recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in the country. He labeled the attack a "special military mission."  Outspoken Russian pop group Pussy Riot has used its stage to protest the war.  Founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova recently dropped a "F--- Putin" at a New York City concert.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I hate war. I love peace. I support Ukraine. F--- Putin. I hope he dies soon," Tolokonnikova said.  Tolokonnikova spoke to The Guardian about the devastation in Ukraine.  "I’m in a panic, I’m crying every day," she told the outlet. "I don’t think it was in any sense necessary. I don’t think it was in any sense logical. It wasn’t something that had to happen. It’s a disaster that will end thousands of people’s lives. I’m freaking out.  ‘You cannot play nice with Putin’  "People underestimate how dangerous dictators are. In 2014, we spoke to the U.K. Parliament, we spoke at the Senate in the U.S., we were asked by a lot of people how they should talk to Putin, how they should frame the conversation, and I always advised that they should be as strict as they could.

Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich were arrested after the group staged a flash mob-style performance in a Moscow cathedral. They performed the song "Close to the Altar" and encouraged the Virgin Mary to "throw Putin out."  "I was traumatized by prison," Tolokonnikova told The Guardian. "I was barely functional when I got released. I suffered from a really severe depression in 2014. I’m still on medication for depression caused by PTSD."

HOLLYWOOD HITS RUSSIA WITH ITS OWN FORM OF SANCTIONS — BARRING CONCERTS, MOVIE FESTIVALS AND MORE  "This is a painful decision as I was looking forward with enormous joy to making music with the exceptionally gifted young Russian artists," Bychkov said. "Yet doing so under the present circumstances would be an unconscionable act of acquiescence."  "I want the spirit of this decision to be unmistakably clear: It is in no way directed at the orchestra or its public. The emotional suffering of ordinary Russian people at this time, the feeling of shame and economic losses they experience are real. So is a sense of helplessness in face of repression inflicted by the regime. Those individuals who dare to oppose this war put their own life in danger. They need us who are free to take a stand and say, ‘The guns must fall silent so that we can celebrate life over death.’"  Russian rapper Oxxxymiron, known formally as Miron Fyodorov, canceled six sold-out shows planned for Moscow and St. Petersburg as part of the antiwar movement.  "I know that most people in Russia are against this war, and I am confident that the more people would talk about their real attitude to it, the faster we can stop this horror," Oxxxymiron said in a video posted to Instagram.

"I never thought that I would be ashamed of Russia. I have always been proud of the talented Russian people, our cultural and sporting achievements," the 30-year-old added. "But now the line is drawn on the before and after.  "It hurts that people are dying, while others are deprived of a roof over their heads or forced to leave their homes.

British ballet dancer Xander Parish revealed he is leaving Russia and the country's prestigious Mariinsky Ballet "until peace comes."  "Dear friends & followers, tonight I was supposed to be performing Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre but instead, due to the awful crisis I have taken the difficult decision to leave Russia, at least until peace comes," Parish wrote .  "My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine, near and far, including @kate_chebykina pictured with me here in @jivoy_dance’s ‘I’m not Scared.'

The House of Representatives voted to approve a $1.5. trillion spending bill that funds the government through Sept. 30 and includes $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine amid the war with Russia.  The defense portion passed by a vote of 361-69, and the domestic portion passed by a vote of 260-171 with one present vote.  The House voted after months of stalling and debate as Congress faced a Friday deadline to approve government funding or risk a shutdown.  In an earlier version of the bill released early Wednesday morning, there was a $15 billion appropriation for pandemic relief. But because of internal friction among Democrats and opposition from Republicans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was forced to push back the expected vote on the package and remove the COVID-19 funds.  TOP LAWMAKERS REACH DEAL ON UKRAINE AID, $1.5T SPENDING  As a result, Democrats missed their planned departure to Philadelphia on Wednesday for a conference retreat. Members told Fox News Digital that delays surrounding the bill had to do with major concerns about coronavirus funding, as well as defense spending levels and the short amount of time to review the contents of the 2,741-page measure just hours before they were expected to approve it.  "It is heartbreaking to remove the COVID funding, and we must continue to fight for urgently needed COVID assistance, but unfortunately that will not be included in this bill," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a Wednesday letter to her fellow Democrats.  "Because of Republican insistence — and the resistance by a number of our Members to making those offsets — we will go back to the Rules Committee to remove COVID funding and accommodate the revised bill. We must proceed with the omnibus today, which includes emergency funding for Ukraine and urgent funding to meet the needs of America’s families."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Some members said they were very upset that states that California and New York were protected from the plan to offset the spending from other states. Republicans insisted that there be spending offsets in the legislation which meant that some COVID-19 spending was to be paid for with cuts to previously approved coronavirus aid to certain states.

If you had told us just four days ago that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on TV. No thanks.  Then, if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the Russian invasion—an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage—if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too preposterous. We will not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could be true. It was too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do we know that? Because we read USA Today, America's newspaper.  Within hours of the Russian invasion , USA Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who were yammering on about secret Ukrainian bio labs. Here was the headline: "Fact check: False claim of US biolabs in Ukraine tied to Russian disinformation campaign."  AMERICAN COUPLE DESPERATE TO FINISH ADOPTING UKRAINE KIDS AS WAR RAGES  So, if you look carefully at the story—and we did because we were interested—you notice that this fact check was sourced to Ukrainian government unnamed officials and then Biden State Department officials. These were not exactly objective sources on this subject, but still the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. "Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of U.S. labs in Ukraine."  OK. USA Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story, but the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same check again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead and we assume they must be QAnon members. We assume that because Foreign Policy Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, QAnon, whatever that is, was frantically disseminating "false claims of U.S. bio warfare labs in Ukraine."  Those labs obviously didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. Then the European Union... weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These are conspiracy theories, the EU told us, they're lies spread by Putin. An EU spokesmen then reminded us that, "the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general, very doubtful and low." That was good to know.  "Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs."  Yeah. We're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. Last thing we want to do on this show is traffic in Russian disinformation spread by QAnon, so we took a pass on that story. And that's where things stood until yesterday when we happened to tune in to a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Toria Nuland was testifying so we were interested. Nuland was one of the people who brought us the Iraq War, never apologized for that and kept getting promoted because that's how DC works. Toria Nuland is now Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State in charge of Ukraine and she knows a lot about Ukraine.  RUSSIAN OLIGARCH RENOUNCES CITIZENSHIP, SAYS IT HAS ‘BECOME A STAMP OF SHAME’  In 2014, Toria Nuland engineered a coup in Ukraine in the name of democracy, of course. So, she is a highly informed source about Ukraine. So, she was having this colloquy with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during her testimony, and at one point, Rubio took a tack that we were not expecting at all. He asked Nuland if Ukraine had biological weapons.  We never imagined Ukraine would have biological weapons. Why would Ukraine have bioweapons? So, it seemed like a pretty strange question, but it wasn't half as shocking as the answer he got. Here's what Toria Nuland said.  SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?  VICTORIA NULAND: Ukraine has a biological research facilities, which, In fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of. So, we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.  Does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ugh, Ukraine has biological research facilities. What? You mean secret bio labs like the secret bio labs that Ukraine definitely doesn't have? Ukraine has those? Yes, it does. And not only does Ukraine have secret bio labs, Toria Nuland said, whatever they're doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, "quite concerned" that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces.  UKRAINE WAR: MORE THAN 1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE FLED UKRAINE SINCE START OF RUSSIAN INVASION  Try not to use profanity on the air to describe our reaction. Our jaws dropped, let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true.  Woah, you don't hear things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian bio labs? Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new Leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it, that there's a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that.  Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine, and why didn't you secure the contents of these bio labs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the "research materials" in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, we've just spent the last two years living with the pathogen that began in another foreign bio lab funded by the United States government secretly.  So, this question is on our mind. It seems fair. Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were U.S. Senators, which were not. Yes, there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important, but Rubio did not ask those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that Vladimir Putin is bad.  SEN. MARCO RUBIO: If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or... attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100%, it would be the Russians that would be behind it?  VICTORIA NULAND: There is no doubt in my mind, senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.  US NUCLEAR EXPERTS ‘MINDFUL BUT NOT FEARFUL’ OF RADIOACTIVE THREAT AMID RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE  OK, just get a pen. It's a classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they are planning to do themselves. That's what Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So, what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if, for example, you were funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are paying for it, in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? It's pretty funny.  What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on the show tonight to tell us what he knows about these bio labs. He declined to come. That invitation remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never played anything like this on the show before because of course, we're Americans and when we want to know what's going on we ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, because it's our country.  We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So, here was the Russian claim.  IGOR KONASHENKOV: During the course of the special military operation, facts were uncovered of the key regime, mopping up traces of military biological program under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry.  OK. So, that apparently—we hadn't seen that until this afternoon we started poking around—that may have been the root of the conspiracy theories that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it: "Military biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry." That's the Russian claim.  Separately, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Ukrainians were working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, we would not take Russia's word for that ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010.  RUSSIA CONFIRMS USE OF THERMOBARIC ‘VACUUM BOMBS’ IN UKRAINE, UK SAYS  "U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level-3 bio-safety lab will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q Fever, as well as other dangerous pathogens."  Oh, OK. Then the National Pulse dug up 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa based laboratory "is responsible for the identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens." So, what we're doing—this is not the first time you've heard this story—we are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study them and prevent people from getting infected with them. Maybe? There are lots of examples of this. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy web page explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this.  Some of the projects include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their web page. How does that work, exactly? They have no right to lie to us.  The web page is archived, thankfully, and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry USA Today, America's newspaper, it's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon is still lying about and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the Pentagon , John Kirby, today.  JOHN KIRBY: The Russian accusations are absurd. They're laughable and, you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda and I wouldn't, if I were you,...I wouldn't give it a drop of ink worth...paying attention to.  REPORTER: Yeah, but can you explain to us what...has there been any relationship between the...?  JOHN KIRBY: We are not, not, developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening.  US REJECTS POLISH PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER MIG-29 PLANES TO UKRAINE, CALLS MOVE ‘HIGH-RISK.’  If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been any relationship between the U.S. Pentagon and a bioweapons facility in Ukraine and if so, what is that relationship? That's Russian disinformation! What's the answer? We're not developing WMD in Ukraine right now! OK, got it, but why are we funding this and what exactly are we funding?  We reached out to the State Department separately and they provided us with this very carefully worded statement: "The U.S. Department of Defense does not own or operate biological laboratories in Ukraine." Not that anyone said they did. Continuing the quote, "Undersecretary Nuland was referring to Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories during her testimony, which are not biological weapons facilities." What's the difference exactly? Continuing the quote, "These institutions counter biological threats throughout the country."  So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So, when you stop lying and telling us what's going on here and why don't you more specifically tell us why you didn't secure these materials? So, yes, we're funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but they are diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats.  OK, if these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, they lied. We're going to the Foreign Ministry of China , a country we despise. Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these facilities in Ukraine right away.  ZHAO LIJIAN: Over the past two decades, the United States has been blocking the establishment of a verification regime to the Biological Weapons Convention and refused to accept the inspection of biological facilities within and outside its borders. The move has further aggravated the concern of the international community. We, once again, urge the U.S. to provide full clarification of its bio militarization activities within and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Oh, they're putting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the screen! Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen and the difference is we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just said. We never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate.  Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war zone. At some point we need to know how that happened, who made those decisions. We have a right to know and let's hope someone in Congress, probably not Marco Rubio, but someone else, will get to the bottom of it, but in the meantime, we pray that somewhere, in the United States government, there as an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately.

Russia has confirmed its use of a thermobaric weapon system, or "vacuum" bombs, during Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.  Vacuum bombs disperse explosive material over a large area that uses surrounding oxygen as fuel when it detonates, creating a blast wave that lasts far longer than conventional explosives. Thermobaric bombs are capable of sucking the air out of person's lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, or causing a person's lungs to rupture or explode.  "The impact of the [TOS-1A] is devastating," the UK Ministry of Defense said in a video. "It can destroy infrastructure and cause significant damage to internal organs and flash burns, resulting in death to those exposed."  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that she discussed Russia's use of vacuum bombs with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday.  "We talked about weapons that Putin is using, weapons prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, including cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, which caused severe suffering," Pelosi told reporters.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, meanwhile, said Wednesday afternoon that he has seen "no indications" that Russia has used thermobaric weapons in Ukraine.  Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, originally told reporters on Feb. 28 after meeting with Congress that Russian forces used a vacuum bomb.  "They should pay, they should pay a heavy price," she said at the time.  WHAT IS A THERMOBARIC BOMB?  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on March 2 that Russia has moved vacuum bombs into Ukraine, accusing Putin of increasing "the brutality of its campaign against" the country.  "We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine," she said in remarks at the UN. "That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs – which are banned under the Geneva Convention."  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  Human Rights Watch explains that vacuum bombs are "prone to indiscriminate use" due to their large blast radius.  "In urban settings it is very difficult to limit the effect of enhanced blast weapons to combatants, and the nature of enhanced blast weapons makes it virtually impossible for civilians to take shelter from their destructive effect," the organization said.  Vacuum bombs, or fuel-air explosives, were developed by the United States in the 1960s for use in Vietnam, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.  RUSSIA'S CLAIM ON US AND UKRAINE BIOLABS 'ABSURD,' 'UNTRUE': US DEFENSE OFFICIAL  Russia used vacuum bombs in Chechnya in the 1990s and more recently during the Syrian civil war.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said last week that if Russia is using vacuum bombs, "it would potentially be a war crime."  International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan is investigating potential war crimes by Russia in Ukraine from 2013 to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. and the U.K. on Wednesday vowed to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin as his forces continue to pummel Ukraine two weeks into the war.  "I'm absolutely convinced that Putin will fail, and Russia will suffer a strategic defeat no matter what short-term tactical gains they may make in Ukraine," Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters from a joint press conference with U.K. Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss.  "You can win a battle, but that doesn't mean you win the war," he continued. "You can take a city, but you can't take the hearts and minds of its people."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russian forces continue to make advances on Ukrainian cities and security officials believe they will attempt to encircle the capital of Kyiv to overthrow the democratically elected government and replace it with a "puppet regime."  The U.S. and NATO have said their forces will not engage with Russia militarily in Ukraine and have instead targeted the Kremlin through severe sanctions and provided Kyiv with defensive aid.  Together the U.S. and the U.K. have provided more than $1.4 billion in security assistance, including through surface-to-air missile defense systems like Javellin, Stinger and MANPAD missiles – which are shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the U.S. and NATO to implement no-fly zones to bar Russian planes from hitting targets in the air.  ZELENSKYY PLEADS WITH US, POLAND TO SEND MIG-29 PLANES, DEFENSE OFFICIALS WARN THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE  Poland on Tuesday issued a surprise announcement that it would send all MiG-29 warplanes to the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany and Ukraine has called for the speedy delivery of these planes.  But U.S. defense officials have warned that deploying warplanes from a U.S. base in a NATO-allied nation could further escalate Russia’s aggression – a concern that was echoed by the British foreign secretary.  "The best way to help protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry," Truss told reporters. "The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia."  The U.K. announced Wednesday that it would send air defense systems to Ukraine to help counter the slurry of missiles Russia has levied at Ukraine.  But both the U.S. and U.K. said their ultimate goal is to continue making Russia’s economic reality increasingly difficult and called on nations like India and those in the Gulf states to follow suit by dropping their Moscow-oil ties.

"We know that if we don't do enough now, other aggressors around the world will be emboldened and we know that if Putin is not stopped in Ukraine, there will be terrible implications for European and global security," she added.

An agonized world watches journalists report from the Ukraine rubble, as the night sky lights up with incoming missiles, as panicked families step over a broken wooden bridge to flee to safety.  What should not be lost amid the inevitable fog is that the media are doing a hell of a good job in conveying not just the military and political strategy surrounding Russia's invasion but the human emotions in a country that is suffering a totally unprovoked attack.  I don’t just mean the journalistic boots on the ground, although they are displaying extraordinary courage in serving as our eyes and ears in a dangerous situation.  I think the media as a whole have risen to the occasion.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Every once in a great while, a story emerges that is so momentous that it doesn’t need to be hyped, teased or trumpeted. It’s a story, generally with life-and-death dimensions, that compels our attention and requires major resources to pursue.  Putin against the world  Ukraine fits those precise descriptions, given that it’s not only the biggest European land war since 1945 but that it pits a seemingly unhinged Vladimir Putin against the world with a horrifying level of suffering that has reached humanitarian crisis levels.  I remember expressing similar sentiments after 9/11, the terrorist attack that so shocked America and the world and felt, even in the opening hours, that it would forever change our way of life. I had the same feeling about Hurricane Katrina and the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, although the virus quickly got caught up in politics as many people felt the press was scaremongering (an accusation that looks very different 950,000 deaths later).  BIDEN BOWS TO DOMESTIC PRESSURE, BANS RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS AFTER DELAY  In ordinary times, the media establishment has a lot of time to fill – cable news hours, column inches, online verticals, social media posts. Everyone is trying to break through the static. So there’s a daily dose of political sniping, charges and countercharges, eye-poking, eye-rolling and garden-variety sensationalism.  All that becomes unnecessary when you’ve got more than 2 million people fleeing a war that includes deliberate bombardment of civilian neighborhoods and supposed escape routes by a country that insists it is not waging a war at all.  ZELENSKYY'S POWERFUL APPEALS DECRY PUTIN'S SHEER BRUTALITY  Tech brings intimacy  Technology has given this conflict an intimate feel, with everyone posting images and videos from TikTok to Twitter, and journalists able to show unspeakable damage and panicked families with a speed and reach that had never been possible.  Now I’m not saying that partisanship has completely vanished from the media landscape. You still have some debates over whether President Biden could have prevented the invasion, whether his Russian oil ban screws American consumers, whether Donald Trump was wrong to tie Ukrainian aid to dirt on Biden.  And there are those voices that are demanding the administration enforce a no-fly zone, which could lead to a direct U.S. military confrontation with Russia, or put Putin himself on the no-survive list, which happens to violate international law.  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES  Close to consensus  But the larger truth is that the country is pretty unified on the Ukraine crisis, and the space between Republicans (some of whom attacked the country as corrupt during the Trump years) and Democrats has visibly narrowed. In a Wall Street Journal poll, 79% of those questioned – including vast majorities in each party – favor the ban on Russian oil and gas, even with the knowledge that it will boost prices here at home. That’s about as close to consensus as we ever come in this country.  We’re also seeing a dramatic drop in the MSNBC and CNN vs. Fox dynamic, a usual prime-time staple. It just feels like an unaffordable luxury when people are trapped and dying and Volodymyr Zelensky is everywhere, pleading for help for his overwhelmed country. The actual reporting and analysis of this brutal war is eating up most of the time that might have been devoted to television towel-snapping.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The coverage hasn’t been perfect. Mistakes have been made. Some journalists have overindulged in emotion. But it reflects the messy, cruel and heartbreaking realities of this war in particular, and as someone who criticizes the press for a living, I’m grateful for however long it lasts.

"This is definitely not the time to pay any taxes to the Russian government," Maryan Zablotskyy , a member of the Ukrainian parliament's finance committee who is spearheading the effort, told FOX Business on Thursday. "These taxes finance guns, ammo and salaries of soldiers who kill Ukrainians. 52 children were killed by the invading forces so far."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "On behalf of the Ukrainian government we will be asking stock exchanges to delist any company which continues to pay taxes in rubles, and investment funds to drop these stocks," Zablotskyy added. "We have also asked US Congress on behalf of the Ukrainian Parliament's Finance Committee to consider banning the trade shares of any company that pay taxes in rubles."  "Our people will be staging protests outside the New York Stock Exchange demanding it delist companies that pay taxes to the Russian government," Zablotskyy told FOX Business.  The Ukrainian Parliament's Committee on Finance, Taxation and Customs Policy sent members of the U.S. Congress a letter Tuesday urging legislators to remove companies that pay taxes to Russia from U.S. stock exchanges.  "Some companies who's [sic] shares are traded on US financial market, continue their operations in Russia and pay taxes to the Russian regime," Danylo Getmantsev, chairman of the parliamentary committee, wrote in the letter provided to FOX Business. "We estimate that these payments are worth billions of dollars. Ultimately, these funds end up paying for the invasion."  "The taxes that these companies pay in Russia finance bombs that kill our military and innocent civilians, including children," Getmantsev added. "We consider it highly immoral to pay any money to Russian government now and believe that these companies should not be listed on the financial markets of the civilized world. Thus, we ask you to consider action of giving these companies a choice: stop paying money to Russian government or get delisted from the US stock market or US-based or US dollar denominated investments."  MCDONALD'S ESTIMATES RUSSIA OPERATION SUSPENSION WILL COST $50M PER MONTH  The letter also asked members of Congress to "sanction and freeze assets of all Russian oligarchs within 48 hours unless they publicly come out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, denounce Vladimir Putin's criminal regime as such and stop any activities that directly or indirectly benefit the regime."  After news of the then-forthcoming letter broke on Monday, McDonald's announced that it would suspend its operations in Russia, joining a host of other companies that had already suspended operations such as BP, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, AT&T, and more. Other companies that suspended Russian operations on Tuesday include Starbucks, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo , YUM! Brands and Papa John's.  Zablotskyy sent FOX Business figures of how much prominent tobacco companies pay the Kremlin in taxes – figures compiled from Russian government tax information and financial reports. The committee calculated that Philip Morris International, Inc. had paid $4.756 billion (USD) in taxes to Russia; that JTI had paid $3.581 billion; that Imperial Tobacco had paid $849 million; that British American Tobacco had paid $371 million; and that the four companies together had paid $9.557 billion.  JTI even brags about its contribution to Russian taxes on its website. "JTI is the biggest investor and the leading tax contributor in the Russian tobacco industry," the website states. "Over the past 20 years its investments in the Russian economy have exceeded $4,6 billion. In 2020, the company's tax payments provided 1,4% of the total revenue of the Russian Federation state budget."

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend energy imports from Russia Wednesday, a day after President Biden signed an executive order enacting a similar ban.  The bill passed 414-17, with only 15 Republicans and two Democrats voting against it.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The House just passed a ban on Russian oil. It’s time to Stick It To Putin At The Pump!" Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., tweeted in celebration of the bill's passage.  "I was proud to take a stand today against Russia and sanction their energy exports for Vladimir Putin's lawless and bloodthirsty invasion of Ukraine," Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the third-ranking House Republican, said in a statement. "However, this bill does not go far enough to make up for the devastating impact of Joe Biden's anti-American energy agenda."  "Joe Biden must do more than swap out one dictator for another dictator's oil," Stefanik added. "Since the beginning, I have been clear that we must fully sanction Russia, punish Vladimir Putin for his aggressive actions, and support the Ukrainian people with the tools they need, short only of U.S. troops on the ground. And I will continue to fight for American energy independence on behalf of families struggling because of skyrocketing gas prices at the pump and our national security in the face of Joe Biden's weak leadership."  Aside from banning the import of Russian oil, the legislation aims to limit Russia's access to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and it reauthorizes legislation that enabled sanctions on human rights abusers. However, it stopped short of an original bipartisan agreement earlier this week that would have suspended normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus.  Earlier on Wednesday, the House passed a $1.5 trillion spending bill that funds the government through Sept. 30 and includes $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine amid the war with Russia. The defense portion passed by a vote of 361-69, and the domestic portion passed by a vote of 260-171 with one present vote.  Russian oil exports account for about one-third of Europe’s oil imports, but they only account for just under 10% of U.S. overall imports.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki vocally condemned a Florida parental rights bill that Democrats have branded a "Don't Say Gay" bill, despite the fact that the bill does not ban the word "gay" in school settings.  Psaki branded the legislation "discriminatory," "horrific," and "a form of bullying" against families and LGBTQ children at a news conference on Wednesday, dodging a question about why President Biden voted for similar legislation when he was a U.S. senator in 1994.  DEMOCRATS CLAIM FLORIDA IS PUSHING ‘DON'T SAY GAY' BILL. HERE'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION ACTUALLY SAYS  The bill, H.B. 1557, requires school districts to adopt procedures that "reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children." It prohibits classroom instruction – not casual discussion – on "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" with children in third grade or younger, "or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."  A reporter asked Psaki about the bill, noting that in 1994, Biden voted for an amendment to an education bill that aimed to "prohibit Federal funds for instructional materials, instruction, counseling, or other services on school grounds, from being used for the promotion of homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative."  "Why did he do that?" the reporter asked. "And can you describe how his thinking has evolved over the years?"  "Well, I think that you have seen the president speak passionately about his view that a bill like this — a bill that would discriminate against families, against kids, put these kids in a position of not getting the support they need at a time where that’s exactly what they need — is discriminatory," Psaki said. "It’s a form of bullying. It is horrific. I mean, the president has spoken to that."  CONSERVATIVES RESPOND AS SPLC CONTINUES TO BRAND THEM ‘HATE GROUPS’ DESPITE TERROR ATTACK, DEFAMATION CLAIMS  Last month, Biden called the legislation a "hateful bill," reassuring "every member of the LGBTQI+ community" that "my Administration will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve."  Psaki referenced Biden's views from 1994, then pivoted immediately to attack the current legislation.  "In terms of his views and comments from 25 years ago, I think the most important question now is: Why are Florida leaders deciding they need to discriminate against kids who are members of the LGBTQI community?" she said. "What prompts them to do that? Is it meanness?"  "Is it wanting to make kids have more difficult times in school, in their communities?" she asked. "I would pose that question to them, and we can talk about it more tomorrow if you get an answer."  Psaki did not clarify how the bill allegedly "discriminates" against certain children and families.  Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis , who is expected to sign the bill, lambasted a WFLA reporter on Monday for saying the "Don’t Say Gay" misnomer during a press conference.  "Does it say that in the bill?" DeSantis asked, adding that "it's why people don't trust people like you because you peddle false narratives."  "And we're going to make sure that parents are able to send their kid to kindergarten without having some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum," the governor said.  Despite critics branding it a "Don't Say Gay" bill, H.B. 1557 does not ban the word "gay" in school settings. Neither does it ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. It does not require schools to notify parents if their child identifies as gay or transgender.  Although the bill requires schools to notify parents of each health care service offered at the school (allowing them to decline any service) and to allow parents to access their children's education and health records, it does not require schools to notify parents about their kids' mental, emotional or physical well-being "if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  DeSantis' office did not respond to an after-hours request for comment on Psaki's accusations.  Fox News' Jessica Chasmar contributed to this report.

A Maryland doctor is dead after a carjacker allegedly stole his car and then fatally struck him as he attempted to get it back, police said.  Dr. Rakesh Patel, 33, a doctor at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, became the victim of a fatal hit-and-run in Silver Spring on Tuesday after he left his car running while he dropped something off at his girlfriend’s house when it was stolen and later rammed him, Fox 5 of Washington, D.C., reported.  Kristine Freoba, a friend of Patel’s girlfriend, told the outlet that the couple was in the process of saying goodnight to one another when they noticed Patel’s Mercedes pulling forward with an unknown individual inside, according to the report.

The New York Times published a "fact check" dismissing GOP criticism of President Biden as gas prices surge across the nation.  As the Russia-Ukraine crisis continues to unfold, there had been mounting pressure for the Biden administration to ban energy imports from Russia and to rely on resources within the U.S. rather than turn to other authoritarian nations like Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia for oil, all while prices at the pump have reached record numbers and were increasing long before the invasion.  BIDEN OFFICIAL ON IF RUSSIA WILL CONVINCE BIDEN TO REEVALUATE KEYSTONE PIPELINE: ‘NO, THAT’S A DISTRACTION'  However, the Times declared Republicans "wrongly blame Biden" for the soaring gas prices.  "As gas prices hit a high this week, top Republican lawmakers took to the airwaves and the floors of Congress with misleading claims that pinned the blame on President Biden and his energy policies," Times fact-check reporter Linda Qiu wrote Wednesday. "While Republican lawmakers supported the ban, they asserted that the pain at the pump long preceded the war in Ukraine. Gas price hikes, they said, were the result of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, the temporary halt on new drilling leases on public lands and the surrendering of 'energy independence' — all incorrect assertions."  Qiu quoted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who accused the Biden administration of wanting to "ramp up energy imports Venezuela and Iran" than "buy from Texas, Alaska and Pennsylvania," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who pointed to Biden canceling construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and halting new oil and gas leases, as well as former Vice President Mike Pence, who touted "energy independence" under the Trump administration and blamed the current administration's actions for the surging gas prices.  MSNBC'S CHUCK TODD: VOTERS WHO BELIEVE PUTIN WOULDN'T HAVE INVADED UKRAINE UNDER TRUMP AREN'T BASED ON ‘LOGIC’  "These claims are misleading," Qiu wrote in bold text. "The primary reason for rising gas prices over the past year is the coronavirus pandemic and its disruptions to global supply and demand." She then cited GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan, who said, "The pandemic brought us to our knees" and pointed to production of U.S. oil which fell in the final months of the Trump presidency. De Haan also told the Times that Biden's actions on U.S. energy played a "very, very small role pushing gas prices up."  Energy Intelligence oil market researcher Abhiram Rajendran knocked the Biden administration for the "pretty stark miscalculation" of U.S. supply to maintain affordable energy prices but similarly said Biden and all presidents have "very little impact on short-term supply."  After writing global demand outpaced supply "mostly attributable" to OPEC's decision to limit increases in production and that the Russia-Ukraine conflict "has only compounded the issues," Qiu summarized, "These factors are largely out of Mr. Biden’s control, experts agreed, though they said he had not exactly sent positive signals to the oil and gas industry and its investors by vowing to reduce emissions and fossil fuel reliance."  BIDEN CLAIMS ‘NOT TRUE’ HE IS HOLDING BACK US ENERGY, WARNS RUSSIAN OIL BAN WILL COST AMERICANS  Qiu touted the Biden administration's "urging" of American companies to ramp up energy production, citing comments in December from Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who told oil companies to "please take advantage of the leases that you have, hire workers, get your rig count up." She later highlighted that the Biden administration approved "34 percent" more energy permits than the Trump administration in its first year, according to the Center of Biological Diversity.  The Times fact-checker also dismissed claims U.S. had "energy independence" under Trump, pointing to Energy Information Administration's projection before he took office that the U.S. would become net energy exporter in the 2020s. She then pointed to the estimated 7.9 million barrels of crude oil imported into the U.S. per day.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  On the subject of the Keystone XL pipeline, Qiu suggested even if Biden had reversed its decision, it would take several years for it to be operational and that supply chain issues and labor shortages would further delay production.

The global head of Eastern Orthodoxy offered a rare public criticism when he condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying "the whole world is against Russia."  During an interview with CNN TÜRK, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople said he maintained "a very good relationship" with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while he described how Russia's recent military actions have strained the country's relationship with the rest of the world.  "We are entering a new era of Cold War," said Patriarch Bartholomew, according to a report. "The distance between Russia and not only Ukraine but the whole Western world, Russia and the Western world is getting bigger. It means that we are entering a new Cold War period."  ZELENSKYY ACCUSES RUSSIA OF 'GENOCIDE' IN UKRAINIAN MATERNITY HOSPITAL BOMBING: LIVE UPDATES  "Anyone who thinks right and acts right does not want this situation, this new Cold War period. As a religious institution, our Patriarchate, has always been in favor of peace and unity, and we continue to do so. We have especially strengthened our prayers these days," he added.  The patriarch of Constantinople serves as the first among equals of the decentralized Eastern Orthodox communion. He presides over any council of Orthodox primates, and he serves as a spokesperson for the Orthodox communion.  When Ukraine gained its independence from the former Soviet Union, the Ecumenical Patriarch said the Orthodox church also granted the country its own independent Orthodox Church. In 2019, a Ukrainian Orthodox Church based in Kyiv formally separated from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that looks to Moscow for leadership. Both churches, however, have garnered criticism from Russia's Orthodox Church.  RUSSIAN VICTORY IN UKRAINE WOULD BE 'COMPLETE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CATASTROPHE,' HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER WARNS  The head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has voiced support for Putin and even went as far as to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war against sinful living and in response to the "extermination" of Donbas separatists.  "We have entered into a struggle that has not a physical, but a metaphysical significance," Kirill said during a church sermon on Sunday, before the start of Lent.  He also said the Donbas citizens are suffering for their "fundamental rejection of the so-called values that are offered today by those who claim world power."  The ongoing struggle, then, was a "test for the loyalty" of those who peddle their own ideas of freedom and "excess consumption."  HUNDREDS OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY URGE TO 'STOP THE WAR' IN UKRAINE  The controversial comments have split Ukrainian Orthodoxy as some are still loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church, despite Putin's militaristic invasion.  Several bishops from Ukraine's independent church have sent a letter critical of Kirill's comments.  "And the reason is obvious. The treacherous open invasion of Ukraine is a huge mistake of Russia," wrote Rev. Mykola Danilevich, who also noted that "many of our priests have stopped commemorating the Moscow Patriarch for worship services."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "People did not hear from the patriarch a clear assessment of this war and his call to stop this madness," Danilevich added.  A 2018 survey found that about 67.3% of Ukraine's population identifies as one or another strand of Orthodox Christianity, with 28.7% part of the Kyiv-based Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), 23.4% simply "Orthodox," and 12.8% Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate.

In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland dated Wednesday, five lawmakers on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee said the tech company engaged in a pattern of misleading conduct "to influence, obstruct, or impede the Committee’s investigation and inquiry."  It was signed by Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., Ken Buck, R-Colo., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.  HOW TECH COULD BENEFIT THE INSURGENCY TO CONFRONT PUTIN  The question is whether the e-commerce giant uses third-party seller data to create its own products and if it gives preference to its own products over those from its competitors in search results.  "Amazon lied," he told Fox News. "They presented documents and testimony that indicated they did not copy third-party sellers' products and there is ample evidence that they did," Buck told Fox News. "  Buck noted that lying about its discriminatory business practices would backfire on Amazon because its alleged lies and coverups to Congress can be brought against them each time the company faces a lawsuit.  In a statement to Fox News, an Amazon spokesperson said there's "no factual basis" for lawmakers' allegations, "as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we've provided over several years of good faith cooperation with this investigation."  In October, the lawmakers asked Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to provide "exculpatory evidence" to corroborate prior committee testimony that Amazon did not use third-party seller data to develop its own products and that it favored its own brands over others.  Amazon executives have denied the practice.  The lawmakers referenced "credible investigative reporting" from The Wall Street Journal and The Markup that published separate investigations on Amazon that they argue say otherwise. The Journal piece alleged that Amazon uses the information it collects on its website from third-party sellers despite previous denials. The lawmakers cited interviews by the Journal with 20 former Amazon employees.  The committee uncovered similar evidence from former and current Amazon employees, as well former sellers, it said.  In July 2020, Bezos, then the CEO of Amazon, testified before the committee in an antitrust hearing that the company had a policy against using seller-specific data to make competing products, a practice he said he was against. A subsequent Reuters report said the company has engaged in such tactics.  The Markup story said Amazon placed products from its house brands ahead of those from competitors. Despite what Amazon says, the legislators accused the company of failing to comply with its requests.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "After Amazon was caught in a lie and repeated misrepresentations, it stonewalled the Committee’s efforts to uncover the truth," the lawmakers wrote. "Without producing any evidence to the contrary, Amazon has left standing what appear to be false and misleading statements to the Committee. It has refused to turn over business documents or communications that would either corroborate its claims or correct the record."  Last year, Cicilline introduced the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which would prohibit giant online platforms from engaging in discriminatory behavior, such as giving preference to their own products. The proposal would give the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission another tool to go after the "self-preferencing conduct that we found with Amazon," Buck said.  A Senate version of the bill was introduced in October by Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIAN OLIGARCH ROMAN ABRAMOVICH SET TO SELL CHELSEA AS PRESSURE MOUNTS  Abramovich said last week he would sell Chelsea as he began to receive some scrutiny over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine.  Abramovich statement  Abramovich released a lengthy statement giving his reasoning. While he hasn’t called on Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, he said the proceeds from the sale would go to benefit war victims.  "I would like to address the speculation in media over the past few days in relation to my ownership of Chelsea FC," he said in a statement. "As I have stated before, I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners.  "The sale of the Club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club. Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery."

The Toyota Highlander Hybrid is the biggest family car that gets 35 mpg, the Toyota Sienna hybrid minivan as rated 36 mpg, and the new Ford Maverick Hybrid pickup is rated at 37 mpg.  Even at $4.25 per gallon, the average driver will need to spend just $150 or so each month to drive them and $5 gasoline would push that to $180.  A compact car like the Toyota Corolla Hybrid costs just $105 monthly to drive, thanks to its 52 mpg rating, and the 56 mpg Toyota Prius brings that below $100. However, despite the Prius' reputation as the granddaddy of hybrids it's not even the most fuel efficient vehicle.  That title belongs to the Hyundai Ioniq, which is a four-door hatchback like the Prius, but has a fuel economy rating of 59 mpg, the most of any car ever sold in the U.S. that doesn't get plugged in.

MINNEAPOLIS – The war in Ukraine has left many people caught in the crossfire, including children in orphanages. Hundreds of American families adopt children from Ukraine, but the process is stalled since the Ukraine government is under attack.  Nikki and Paul Hynek of Iowa have been in the middle of the adoption process for over four years. They have hosted 10-year-old Viktor multiple times over winter and summer break. All the paperwork was ready for Viktor to come to America and then COVID-19 hit.  Fast-forward two years and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is preventing the family from finally being together.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "He has a very loud personality," Paul said about Viktor.  Viktor has two siblings who will come over to America with him. His 12-year-old brother Vadim has already been to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to meet the Hyneks too. The two were last there just months ago during Christmas. His 16-year-old sister Slova originally didn’t want to come to America until the war broke out. Now all three are eager to make it to Iowa.  "He lights up a whole room when he walks into it," Nikki said. "Whenever he comes here, we just have the best time with him. He just keeps us on our toes. It’s just like the world is his oyster and he goes after it."  Stuck in the middle  While his room sits ready for him in America, Viktor and his siblings are stuck in the middle of the war in Ukraine.  "When they were traveling on the train, they saw a ton of bombing and missiles as they described it to us.

Help for American families  CCAI Adoption Services in Colorado is trying to help 45 American families adopt more than 80 children from Ukraine.  "There isn’t a way to move forward with adoptions right now because the offices that would do this, the courts are not open in Ukraine. So, paperwork can’t be sent over. Processes can’t continue as is," Julie Winger, CCAI's director of adoptions, said.  It’s been difficult to keep in touch directly with the orphanages to let families know how the kids are doing, she added.  "I think that they all know there’s will be long-term consequences for all the people of Ukraine and the trauma that they’re going through," Winger said.  For families like the Hyneks, their biggest fear is that Russia will take over Ukraine.  "If I dream about it, and they’re overrun by Russia, obviously it’s going to be very sad. It would be like losing a child and that will just be gut-wrenching pain," Paul Hynek said.

"These kids are children, and they have parents and futures, especially here in America with parents that they know and love," Nikki Hynek said.  The family says they have Facetime conversations every day and the kids always ask when they will be allowed to come to America.

Jesse Watters voiced concern over Russia's malign actions toward sensitive Ukrainian infrastructure like maternity hospitals and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on "Jesse Watters Primetime."  Discussing the topic with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the lawmaker pointed to testimony from Biden Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland about the risks from the Ukrainian biolab, and said Russian President Vladimir Putin was guilty of "war crimes."  Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Ukraine does have labs, and that the United States was helping them keep Russia from taking them over.  "While I was at that hearing, I was pretty surprised to hear what Secretary Nuland had to tell us," Johnson said Wednesday.  "I think you've described it pretty well," he said. "I certainly was concerned what our activity was in the Wuhan lab — I've been trying to get, for example, the State Department report on the Wuhan lab — and the State Department is not being transparent with me."  "But what I can say is I'm concerned about what Russia's doing in Ukraine because of these types of facilities … look at how reckless they are with the nuclear facilities now being bombed."  Johnson said he hopes Putin's military commanders who are engaging in this risky behavior are brought up on international charges after the war.  "I'm highly concerned about the carelessness, not to mention the atrocities now being committed by Russia in their unprovoked and aggressive war toward Ukraine," he said.  Watters asked why there would even be such a biolab in a geopolitically tense country like Ukraine.  CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I don't trust Putin with bio. It's just it's too nuts. After what happened in Wuhan, we can't have that happen again."  "Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach," Nuland said.  Nuland said this in response to a question from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., about whether Ukraine had chemical or biological weapons.  Nuland said that if there is any biological or chemical attack in Ukraine, "there is no doubt in my mind" that it would be carried out by Russia, and that it is "classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they’re planning to do themselves."

U.S. nuclear experts on Wednesday said people should be aware of the chance for nuclear disaster amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but that one isn't necessarily likely, even as Chernobyl lost power and the Zaporizhzhia plant is also under Russian control.  "People should be mindful but not fearful," Oregon State nuclear science and engineering professor Kathryn A. Higley told reporters at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.  "I mean, we don't have any release going on," Higley continued. "And folks also need to be aware that after Chernobyl, the European Union created a pretty robust data monitoring and sharing network to be able to address radioactive releases from any facilities across Europe."  UKRAINE'S CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DISCONNECTED FROM POWER GRID, SPARKING FEAR OF RADIATION LEAKS  Higley made the comments at a press conference organized by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a group that promotes the use and expansion of nuclear energy globally, but particularly in the U.S. She was joined by NEI president and CEO Maria Korsnick and senior vice president for policy development and public affairs John Kotek.  Kotek and Korsnick emphasized that the design of Ukraine's several nuclear power plants is much safer than the design of Chernobyl. A reactor explosion at the Chernobyl plant in 1986 caused the worst nuclear disaster in world history.  Among the plants with a safer design is Zaporizhzhia, which is currently under control of Russian soldiers while it continues to be run by Ukrainian specialists. The plant was shelled by Russians last week.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Korsnick said there's information indicating Russian soldiers are allowing Ukrainian operators to change shifts at the plant, which is a "healthy" sign.  The NEI experts also said it's unlikely the power loss at Chernobyl will present a near-term threat because the fuel there is so old it may not be hot enough to cause significant problems.  "At Chernobyl… the last reactor was shut down in the year 2000. So the spent fuel that's on site there has had 20 plus years to cool," Kotek said. "I can point to a statement from the IAEA related to this just earlier today. They said that heat load of spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is sufficient for effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply."  The loss of power at Chernobyl is the third major incident that caused international nuclear fears to spike during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The first was the initial fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces at Chernobyl and the second was the shelling of Zaporizhzhia.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday the loss of power to Chernobyl may make "radiation leaks imminent," despite the reassurances from the NEI and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts.  International leaders strongly rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin for flirting with such potential nuclear disasters, in addition to condemning him for the invasion of Ukraine in and of itself.  Russian forces Wednesday continued to attack Ukrainian civilians, including by bombing a children's hospital in Mariupol. More than 2 million refugees are estimated to have fled the country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  U.S. officials estimate more than 3,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine so far.  Fox News' Stephanie Pagones and Andrew Murray contributed to this report.

More than one million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since the start of the Russian invasion nearly two weeks ago, according to the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday.  At least 37 children have been killed and 50 were injured in the weeks since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24., UNICEF's Catherine Russell said in a statement.  Russell said she was "horrified" by the reported attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on Wednesday that wounded more than a dozen people, including women near childbirth, Ukrainian officials said, according to the Associated Press.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  "I am horrified by the reported attack today on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine – an attack which reportedly left young children and women in labor buried beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings," Russell said.  "This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine’s children and families," she added. "In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries."  Attacks from Russian forces on residential buildings and hospitals have forced families and medical patients, including expectant mothers, to take shelter underground and receive medical services in makeshift shelters.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared video of what he described as the "direct strike of Russian troops" on the maternity hospital in Mariupol. He once again demanded the skies be closed over Ukraine.  "People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!" Zelenskyy tweeted. "How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity."  More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin approved a "special military operation" in the country last month, according to a tracker from the United Nations refugee agency.  Reuters reported that those who fled are mostly women and children because the Kyiv government has ordered able-bodied men to stay in the country and fight.  But many of the children fleeing are either unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members, UNICEF says. The agency warned that children without parental care are at a "heightened risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation."

On February 23 I presented the first part of my Ph.D. study, dedicated to ultra-marathon running, at my university. After that, I packed my bags and checked-in online for the flight to Barcelona that was planned for February 24.  I had just finished a very hard training cycle with peak volume of more than 140 miles per week and was ready to start a 6h race at Ultra Running Barcelona on February 27. Prepared to fly to Spain the next day, my girlfriend and I fell asleep.  We woke up at 5 a.m. because of the sound of explosions. We checked news and find out that there was attack on Boryspil airport and a lot of other objects all around Ukraine. The war had started.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Our decision was to get to Zhytomyr – 80 miles from Kyiv. This is my girlfriend’s hometown. Her parents live there and also my car was there. To get to my car to become more mobile, stay together and then make a decision about next steps – was our choice.  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  The problem was that the way to Zhytomyr already was jammed with traffic. Almost without any movement. Thousands of cars tried to escape in panic. So, we decided to wait a day until first wave of panic would stop. At that time our friends from Irpin (town just near Kyiv) welcomed us to stay the night with them, suggesting that it would be easier to travel from this town in the morning.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: PHOTOS SHOW UKRAINIANS TRAVERSING BROKEN BRIDGES TO FLEE AS THOSE AT HOME BURY THEIR DEAD  Just when we got to our friends’ house, the fight for Hostomel airport, which neighbors on Irpin, started. From February 25 to 26 we spent the night in the basement of a private house. It was a small dusty place where 5 adults, a 5-month-old baby, a dog and a cat slept on the floor. Actually, we did not really sleep because of the explosions that continued all night. In the morning we all got into our friend’s car and left the town.  You feel shaking walls, think that this is the end.  The traffic on the road to Zhytomyr was very hard. It took us about 5 hours to get to the city (usually it’s 3 times faster). When we arrived, we found out that bridge to Kyiv was destroyed so it is not possible anymore to return the same way. Also, we heard news about fights near Kyiv from other sides of the capital of Ukraine.  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  We decided not to run away and stay in Zhytomyr. This is a big city – it’s in the center of Zhytomyr region, which is borders Belarussia. So, it is not the safest place. But it is a place where I thought I could do something to help fight against enemies. For now, to join Ukrainian army or local defense force you have to have appropriate experience, which I don’t have.  So, me and my girlfriend just started to do what we could. So now we buy and deliver water and snacks to soldiers on block posts, we help with building fortifications and do other volunteer work. It’s not much but it’s important for our victory.  JEWISH-AMERICAN IMMIGRANT FROM UKRAINE REFLECTS ON PARENTS' DECISION TO COME TO US  Today Zhytomyr lives under war conditions – there are a lot of block posts, many people in ammunition and with guns. But mostly living here is comfortable. Food shops are working. We can buy most of what we need. There is a deficit with regards to fuel, socks and underwear.  Also, it is forbidden to sell alcohol. Public transport is restricted, but it works. Everything is alright with electricity, phone connection and internet. There is no panic, just preparation to meet Russians if they will try to get there.  As in other big Ukrainian cities, Zhytomyr suffers from Russian bombs and missiles. First time I was really scared when Russian missiles hit residential area just a few hundred meters from our home.  The noise of approaching missiles or jets is terrifying. You feel shaking walls, think that this is the end. Those days Russians killed 4 civilians in the city. Dozens of houses were totally destroyed. The next day a bomb hit the school, then an oil base.  Just when I am writing this essay, I could hear jets and explosions. Now I understand that noise – it is not very close to me, rather another side of the city.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Our news is telling that this was bombing of local factory that produce some stuff for construction. And destroyed apartment building – not military objects at all. No information about victims.  I am trying to stay positive and strong, but sometimes feel helpless. Before the war I was a coach for local running club. I organized group training and wrote training plans for those, who want to run a marathon or trail.  Now it is not an option, so I have lost all my incomes. I left my home in Kyiv and don`t know if it still stands.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Life became too uncertain. But I don’t think myself as a victim. There are thousands of people in Ukraine who are in more danger than me, who lost much more.  I just wish this war will end soon, we will rebuild our country and I will be able to run another 100 miles.

Why hasn’t cyber figured more prominently in Russia’s war on Ukraine? Russia is, after all, a powerhouse in this area having successfully cyber-attacked Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2015-2016. Add to that an unexpectedly difficult start to the current, long-planned campaign against Ukraine and the question becomes even more perplexing. Analysts have many and varied views on the matter and recent reporting has laid out almost a dozen different potential explanations. Some suggest there is no need to go there, and that the possible downside outweighs any upsides. Others suggest that Putin may still go there - just not yet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The latter explanation is compelling if only because it requires us not to let down our guard and to continue marching forward on plans to expand and deepen America’s own cyber resilience posture and abilities to withstand cyber and electronic warfare. The good news is that certain key sectors that represent critical infrastructure and support vital national functions have been enhancing their defenses for years. Think financial services and energy for example.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  The bad news is that other equally important sectors are nowhere near as prepared. Think water - which is working to up its game but is nowhere near where it needs to be as the recent spate of ransomware has made clear. And this is the state of play among the big dogs. Yet the U.S. is an incredibly target-rich environment for any adversary because of the sprawling decentralized nature of both its public and private sector. Put differently: Small and medium size enterprises are not outside the crosshairs.  JAMES JAY CARAFANO: WHAT CHINA IS LEARNING FROM PUTIN'S UKRAINE INVASION  Officials have been working hard to raise awareness and offer assistance to both public and private entities that may not have the resources or ability to properly protect themselves on their own in the current climate that is so rife with potential cyber threats. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (better known as CISA) has been doing yeoman’s work in this area. But the scope of the challenge is enormous.  So where should we go from here? We must better marshal our efforts so that the piecemeal and uneven progress that has been made to date becomes a more streamlined national effort that makes it far harder for any adversary to achieve its ends. Having a National Cyber Director (NCD) to act as coordinator and definitively take point on the all-important task of prioritizing our game plans and facilitating their execution in a way that ensures that they will be more than just the sum of their parts is a true step forward.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  But the NCD will not be able to go it alone. Public and private efforts must cohere and partnerships must be more meaningful than ever before. It’s a tall order but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) under CISA auspices is a powerful tool that could rise to the challenge if all stakeholders determinedly make that their mission. Among its payoffs could be better situational awareness than the nation has ever had - and coordinated operations that give bad actors a serious run for their money.      We may not yet be where we need to be, but we can’t take our eyes off the ball. So far the conflict in Ukraine may not have unfolded exactly as Russia thought it would; but these are still early days in what is likely to be a long and punishing war. Longtime expert Putin-watchers underscore that he may lash out further should he feel cornered. He has already made an implied threat concerning the use of nuclear weapons. And now Russian forces claim to have taken over a nuclear plant in Ukraine - the largest such plant in Europe.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    What comes next is anybody’s guess.

Vladimir Putin’s shameful invasion of Ukraine has an undeniable geopolitical and economic ripple effect around the world. In addition to supporting Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and holding Russia accountable through economy-crippling sanctions, we must take practical action to mitigate the impact this attack has on the global supply of energy and agriculture commodities.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The impact on energy has garnered significant international attention, and understandably so. Russia is a major supplier of natural gas across Europe, and because of recent domestic energy production policies, Russia is the United States’ fourth-largest supplier of crude oil. The need to unleash America’s energy resources is clearer than ever, but another important consideration, which many have not considered, is Ukraine’s role as "the Breadbasket of Europe."  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  According to Commerzbank AG, Russia and Ukraine together account for almost a third of the world’s wheat exports and almost 20% of its corn exports. Just like energy, food touches everything and is something everyone needs to survive. The unfortunate reality, however, is the food sector is already being extremely disrupted by Putin’s war on Ukraine. Just this week the UN Global Food and Agriculture Organization reported global food prices have hit an all-time high.  The unfortunate reality, however, is the food sector is already being extremely disrupted by Putin’s war on Ukraine.  As we move into the spring planting season – if we effectively address our current supply chain, regulatory, and inflation challenges – producers in the United States are in a strong position to help alleviate potentially devastating shortages and ensuing hunger around the world.  For American farmers to be able to do what they do best – feed, fuel, and fiber the globe – the American government must do its part by focusing on alleviating supply chain challenges, which will go a long way in decreasing input costs and getting food to consumers around the world.  According to the February "Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer," 30% of crop producers in the United States expressed some difficulty purchasing 2022 crop inputs from suppliers. The survey also underscores farmers’ concerns with inflation, highlighting higher input costs as their number one concern for the last six months. Take fertilizer for example: Many farmers are easily spending triple to fertilize their land, and fertilizer prices could soar even higher as the situation in Ukraine worsens.  COLIN REED: BIDEN'S FAILURES BY THE NUMBERS - THE ENERGY COSTS, POLL NUMBERS TELL THE STORY  One of Congress’s top priorities to ease the pressure being felt by the agricultural community should be to address the delays and bottlenecks which are making it difficult to get the supplies needed for planting season. Similarly, these supply chain disruptions also cause uncertainty on where and how agricultural goods can be moved efficiently to consumers.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  A great example of this can be found at U.S. ports. These bottlenecks and delays are disproportionately impacting agricultural exports as foreign ocean carriers are leaving ports completely empty rather than shipping American food to our global markets. Last week the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on legislation passed by the House of Representatives, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. This bill, cosponsored by both of us, would update federal regulations for the global ocean shipping industry and make it more difficult for ocean carriers to refuse service to American exporters. This is a great first step.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  We should also address inflation by cutting red tape and removing overly burdensome barriers to domestic energy production. The Biden administration’s energy agenda has been a self-inflicted wound to the American economy and the environment. We should be tapping into our resources to become energy independent. We can reduce emissions by producing cleaner American energy and exporting it to the world. Increasing production would also lower costs for American consumers like farmers and ranchers who are seeing their fuel costs skyrocket.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  North Dakotans and Nebraskans already know farmers and ranchers are some of our most resilient neighbors. Through natural disasters and humanitarian crises – in times of war and in peace – they carry on and show up for our country and world. It’s time for the Biden administration to halt its assault on American energy, and show up for farmers, ranchers, and producers by addressing our supply chain crisis.

The Duke, 39, and Duchess, 40, of Cambridge met with members of the Ukrainian community and their volunteers in hopes of learning about services being offered at the center as well as the challenges they continue to face.  The duo wore matching blue and yellow Ukrainian flag pins on their clothing during their visit. They also brought along homemade brownies and granola bars from Kensington Palace for the volunteers, which was documented on Twitter.  QUEEN ELIZABETH RECEIVES INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY TRIBUTE FROM MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY  "Over the past two weeks, communities and organisations here in the UK have come together to provide vital support to Ukrainians here in Britain and across Europe," the couple tweeted from their joint account.  "The Ukrainian Cultural Centre in London has become one of many hubs organising donations, material aid and supporting Ukrainians living locally. The work volunteers here are doing to ensure that help gets to where it is most needed is inspiring," they added.  "So too is the incredible generosity of the British public. The Disasters Emergency Committee has already received over £132 million in donations, and continues to raise funds to support the essential humanitarian effort."  PRINCE CHARLES CONDEMNS RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE: ‘BRUTAL AGGRESSION’  Their surprise visit comes after Middleton and Prince William have been outspoken in support of the war-torn country.  "In October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine's future," a previous statement from the couple said. "Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future."

Zelenskyy shared that he and his wife, Olena, "are grateful to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge @RoyalFamily that at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia's invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens."

On Wednesday, a Russian airstrike devastated a maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol amid growing warnings from the West that Moscow’s invasion is about to take a more brutal and indiscriminate turn. Ukrainian officials said at least 17 people were wounded in the attack.  The Associated Press contributed to this report

More than three years after Jussie Smollett told police he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack on a dark, cold Chicago street, all the questions swirling around the actor – from whether he staged a fake attack to why he would do such a thing – now boil down to two: Will he admit he lied to police and will he be sent to prison?  On Thursday, three months after a jury found him guilty of lying to police, those questions will be answered when Smollett, a onetime star of the television show "Empire," returns for sentencing to the courtroom where he was found guilty of lying to police about an attack prosecutors say he orchestrated himself.  Smollett was convicted of five of six felony counts of disorderly conduct – for lying to police. He was acquitted on a sixth count. He faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison per count.  Cook County Judge James Linn can order the maximum sentence, a much shorter sentence or put Smollett on probation, meaning he won’t have to spend time behind bars. And he can order a fine and restitution – the amount of which could reach tens of thousands of dollars.  KARDASHIANS REVEAL WHAT'S COMING TO NEW HULU SHOW  Defendants convicted of lying to police, one of the least serious felonies in Illinois, rarely go to prison. But this is a rare case.  Prosecutors showed Smollett, who is Black and gay, went to extraordinary lengths in January 2019 to stage a hate crime. He hired and paid two brothers to carry out the attack, prosecutors said, told them what racist and homophobic slurs to shout, and to yell that Smollett was in "MAGA Country," a reference to the campaign slogan of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.  The brothers testified that Smollett gave them money to buy the rope they were to fashion into a noose around his neck and the ski masks to hide their faces. He then pointed them to where he wanted the scene to play out in the hopes it would be captured by a surveillance camera.  In doing so, he sparked already raw emotions over issues such as race and sexual identity in the country, and triggered a massive investigation in a city involving dozens of officers in what Smollett has maintained was a very real attack by two men he did not recognize.  PIERS MORGAN ANNOUNCES NEW LIVE PRIME-TIME SHOW ‘UNCENSORED’  During the hearing, prosecutors and Smollett's attorneys will get a chance to present witnesses and allow Smollett to make a statement. And unlike the trial, Linn has agreed to let photographers and a television camera inside court for the hearing – meaning the public will for the first time get to see and hear Smollett speak in court.  A key question is whether Special Prosecutor Dan Webb will ask Linn to sentence Smollett to jail or prison. Webb, in an interview with The Associated Press, would not say.  "I think this will probably be a point that I make in sentencing," Webb said, "that not only did Mr. Smollett lie to the police and wreak havoc here in the city for weeks on end for no reason whatsoever, but then he compounded the problem by lying under oath."  To drive home that point, some legal experts say they expect Webb to call law enforcement officials to testify.  "Somebody from the CPD (Chicago Police Department) can testify how this crime directly impacted the police department, diverted resources away from actual crimes and the cost the city incurred," said Joe McMahon, who as a special prosecutor won a murder conviction for Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke in the 2014 fatal shooting of Black teenager Laquan McDonald.  McMahon and others also said Webb might call witnesses to testify about the impact that Smollett’s scheme may have had on legitimate victims of racist and homophobic attacks.  "They could say that his (Smollett’s) false report made it less likely that real victims will come forward and will continue to suffer in silence," McMahion said.  ENNIFER ANISTON APPLAUDS UKRAINIAN WOMEN DEFENDING THEIR COUNTRY: ‘YOU’RE INCREDIBLE  Experts say it is almost certain that Smollett will speak. He could cover the same ground as he did during the trial in which he testified about his extensive involvement in charity organizations, including a group that fights AIDS in the Black community. He might again speak of how he's already been punished, that his career has been devastated.  And Smollett, who made daily appearances outside the courtroom of supporters who vouched for his character, has already received the support of dozens of people, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the president of the NAACP.  Reminding the judge of the actor's extensive volunteer work and donations to charitable causes, the supporters have sent letters to Linn asking for leniency: probation or community service instead of a prison sentence.  Smollett could admit he staged the attack and then lied repeatedly about it – including on the witness stand under oath. But his lead attorney, Nenye Uche, proclaimed his client innocent after the trial and vowed an appeal, and has said nothing since to suggest he will reverse course.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  In fact, Uche plans to present a motion to dismiss the conviction, but judges rarely grant such motions.  What all of it will add up to is unknown. But several experts say they don't think the judge will impose the maximum sentence or that Smollett will see the inside of a prison. But, they say, there is a good chance he lands in county jail for several months.  "What he did was bad and lying about it was bad," said Terry Ekl, a prominent Chicago-area defense attorney who is not involved with the case. "And the fact that you are dividing a community along racial and political lines that is already deeply divided, I think that moves this case out of the probation category."

A restaurant in France has reportedly received threats over its signature dish, poutine, because some people have been incorrectly associating the dish with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  La Maison de la Poutine, which has locations in Paris and Toulouse, posted a statement on social media last week saying that it has received "calls of insults and even threats" over its name, according to a translation of the French statement.  Though the name may sound similar to the Russian president, poutine has no actual connection Putin. Poutine, which originated in Canada, is made of French fries, cheese curds and gravy.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  In its statement, La Maison de la Poutine clarified that it "is not linked to the Russian regime and its leader."  "Our dish was born in Quebec in the 1950s," the restaurant said. "And the stories to tell its origin are numerous. But one thing is certain: the poutine was created by passionate cooks who wanted to bring joy and comfort to their customers."  CANADIAN DINER REMOVES POUTINE FROM NAME BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE PUTIN  La Maison de la Poutine went on to say that it offers "its most sincere support to the Ukrainian people who fight courageously for their freedom, against the tyrannical Russian regime."  HOW AMERICAN CITIES ARE HELPING THEIR UKRAINIAN SISTER CITIES  This isn’t the first time someone has made the connection that poutine sounds like Putin.  Fox News Digial previously reported that a diner in Drummondville, Quebec, Le Roy Jucep, decided to take the word "poutine" out of its trademark to show solidarity with Ukraine after Russia invaded the country – and to make people smile.  Le Roy Jucep, which claims to have invented poutine, posted its decision to remove the word "poutine" from its name, though the dish is still available on its menu.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The business's Facebook page still lists it as the inventor of "poutine," although the name has been changed to say "The Inventor of Fries, Cheese and Gravy."  Though Le Roy Jucep reportedly received some hateful replies and phone calls for the change, it also got plenty of love.  In a post on Facebook, the restaurant wrote: "Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that's already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts."

Europe's green energy policies empowered Russian President Vladimir Putin and stripped Western countries of their ability to sanction Moscow effectively, according to the best-selling author of "Apocalypse Never."  "You're not really an independent nation if you depend on foreign countries so heavily for your energy supplies," Michael Shellenberger told Fox News. He said European nations have become increasingly dependent on Russia for energy in recent years as they have adopted green policy initiatives.  The continent imports nearly 40% of its gas from Russia, according to the Associated Press. It consumes nearly five times as much oil as it produces, and Russia produces nearly four times as much oil as it consumes, according to British Petroleum.  Europe's dependency on Russian energy limits its ability to take actions such as imposing economic sanctions against Russia in response to the conflict in Ukraine, according to Shellenberger.  UKRAINE CONFLICT ‘HEIGHTENS THE RISK’ OF CHINESE-AMERICAN WAR, PROFESSOR SAYS  "Fifteen years ago, Europe produced more natural gas than Russia," Shellenberger said. "Today, Russia exports three times more natural gas to Europe than Europe produces."  "That's due both to the fact that Russia increased its natural gas production and Europe reduced it," he added.  "Europe decided not to frack in large part in response to climate activists," Shellenberger told Fox News. "We now think there is strong evidence suggesting [the climate activists] were supported directly through financing from Russia."  Moscow intelligence agencies, for example, secretly supported European environmental groups in campaigns against fracking in order to keep the European Union dependent on Russian exports, according to a 2018 congressional report.  But environmental activist groups do not disclose their donors, so any benefactors of Russia’s donations remain unknown, according to Shellenberger.  Additionally, Europeans became more reliant on Russian energy because of nuclear energy policies.  Putin "expanded nuclear power at home so that he could export more natural gas abroad rather than use it for electricity production," Shellenberger said. "Europe shut down its nuclear plants and declined to build new ones."  Russia's nuclear power capacity has increased by 33% since 2002, according to the World Nuclear Association. Germany's nuclear capacity has decreased by over 80% in that time period.  "That has proven to be catastrophic as the continent became increasingly dependent on Russia for energy imports," Shellenberger told Fox News.  Shellenberger described rising oil costs and foreign dependencies as "the worst energy crisis since 1973."  "I think the chances are very high that it's going to result in a global recession," Shellenberger told Fox News. "When oil prices reach these levels, they tend to trigger recessions."  DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas recently told Barron's: "History shows that a 100% increase in oil prices over a year usually triggers a recession (1990, 2000, 2008). We’re not quite there yet, but we are getting closer by the day.  Crude oil reached $130 per barrel Sunday evening, according to CNBC. A year ago, it was $63.81.  Shellenberger said oil prices could hit $200 per barrel.  European reliance on Russian energy leaves Western countries with little leverage against Putin in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, according to Shellenberger.  President Biden announced on Tuesday a ban on U.S. imports of Russia oil. Last year, the U.S. imported 7% of its petroleum from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  "Our hearts are with the Ukrainians," Shellenberger said. "We would love to be able to punish the Russians and stop importing their energy, but efforts to do that will make energy more expensive."  "It was always predictable," Shellenberger said of the energy crisis and European dependence on Russian energy. "This was all very apparent to people that were rational thinkers on energy."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Prosperity, sovereignty and energy independence are all interconnected, according to Shellenberger.  "There is no low-energy rich nation, just as there is no high-energy poor nation," he said.  "I hope it’s a wake-up call," Shellenberger told Fox News. "At best, we can hope to avoid a global recession, but that's going to require a significant expansion of energy supplies in the United States and Europe as quickly as we can."

The Republic of Georgia's acting ambassador to the U.S., whose home is partially occupied by Russian forces, criticized Vladimir Putin's intimidation tactics in the region and called for more sanctions against the authoritarian regime.  "The lessons that the world has learned based on the Georgian tragic experience [is] that once you have a bully inside the room, there is no other way of dealing with this bully than giving [him] an adequate response," Giorgi Tsikolia said of the Russian president.  "This is what we've been pushing hard as a message here as well, pushing for additional sanctions against Russia," Tsikolia told Fox News.  After publication, Tsikolia and his team clarified that he was calling for sanctions over Russia's occupation of Georgia. They repeatedly avoided saying whether Georgia supported sanctioning Moscow over the Ukraine invasion.  "We are looking at sanctions as an ongoing daily process, closely examining each new measure together with our Western partners," an embassy spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News after publication. "As of today, we have joined all measures in international fora and finance sector, condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine."  Georgia has refused to sanction or call for sanctions against Russia, with Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili saying they "would only damage our country and populace more." Tens of thousands of Georgians have since protested and called for Garibashvili's resignation, according to The Guardian.  Russian forces invaded Ukraine nearly two weeks ago after amassing troops on its border for months.  BIDEN ANNOUNCES BAN ON US IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, GAS: LIVE UPDATES  In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia, a former Soviet satellite state. Russia seized Abkhazia and South Ossetia during the conflict.

"We understand firsthand the threats that the Russian military and military aggression presents."  Tsikolia, who spoke with Fox News from the Georgian embassy in downtown Washington, is the highest-ranking Georgian diplomat in the U.S. after former Ambassador David Bakradze’s term ended just days into Russia's war against Ukraine.  "In our struggle to build a European nation and become part of the West, we've been in this fight against Russian military aggression since [the] beginning of [the] '90s," Tsikolia said.  "Democracy, market economy and the rule of law will at the end prevail," he continued.  US COULD INCREASE GAS EXPORTS TO HELP EUROPE MOVE AWAY FROM RUSSIAN ENERGY, CEO SAYS  President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas.  Tsikolia told Fox News that maintaining stability in Georgia should remain a top priority for the West, especially given the energy resources that flow thorough Georgia to the rest of Europe.  "With what we see right now in the news and with the West trying to divest from the Russian energy supply, Caspian Energy is the only alternative source of supply of energy to Europe, and all those pipelines go through Georgia," Tsikolia said. "Russian troops are stationed three, four miles away from those pipelines, so [we] have to be very vigilant to make sure that Georgia is stable."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Still, Tsikolia expressed sympathy for the Russian people.  "The people of Russia, to the large extent, have been suffering the policies of the government for years," Tsikolia said. "It is tragic from the historical perspective of looking at what is happening to Russia right now and the ideals that existed in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union."  "All those ideals today have been shattered," he continued. "Our hope of people who believe in the free world and believe in democracies is that one day we will see a light coming out of Russia, and hopefully that day will come soon."  EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been updated to include additional details and a statement Tsikolia and his team provided after publication, though they repeatedly refused to clarify whether Georgia supports unilateral sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

"You can run, but you never will escape yourself," Prokhorenko said.  Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two weeks ago. Prokhorenko said he's been inspired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership. Zelenskyy has also vowed to stay in Kyiv.  Zelenskyy filmed a video Monday from his Kyiv office saying "I'm not hiding" and "not afraid of anyone." In a speech Tuesday, Zelenskyy said, "we will fight till the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost."  "Today I had only six volunteers" and "we delivered 25 portions of packed food to old people who are alone," the restaurateur said.  FORMER UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR ON PUTIN'S KILL LIST CALLS ON BIDEN, AMERICA ‘TO BE LEADER OF THE WORLD’  He said he delivered "medicine to women with children, people ill with cancer." Prokhorenko told Fox News the "eyes" of those receiving his help "saying thank you" were indescribable.  Prokhorenko uses Instagram to help connect people with different items they need. Soon, many people started reaching out to him, asking for other tasks.  "Can you do this, can you do this?" Prokhorenko quoted.  "As long as I'm here, I will never stand and watch. I will help," he said.  Prokhorenko couldn't find the words to describe how people still living in Kyiv felt.  "It's pain, anger, fear, courage," he said. "There should be a word for this feeling."  WATCH:  "I wouldn't wish for anyone to feel what we feel now," Prokhorenko continued.  While Kyiv remains under Ukrainian control, its suburbs have increasingly seen indiscriminate Russian attacks.  "The whole city is prepared to give a fight," Prokhorenko told Fox News while walking through deserted streets.  "I don't want to do this, but if someone threatens my independence, my people, then yes I'm ready to take a gun to protect," he told Fox News. "Not to kill but to protect. This is the difference between us."  Russia is "trying to invade. They're killing our women, they're killing our children, killing civilians, destroying … everything we built," Prokhorenko said.  Prokhorenko called on Russians to take greater action to stop Putin. Some of his friends from Moscow have asked him: "'What should we do?'"  Prokhorenko's response: "What should you do? Go on the streets, our people are stopping tanks with their bodies because they are not afraid."  "Russian people are afraid to be beaten. We are not afraid, we are not afraid," he told Fox News.  "We are ready to fight. If I have to fight, I'll fight."  The Kyiv local also pleaded for the world to do more.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Everybody should know that the third world war has started," Prokhorenko said. "And we all have to stop it, not just us. We are all in danger."  Prokhorenko said he felt the "whole world is helping us" "and standing behind us," but asked that countries send more weapons and provide greater funding. He also asked for NATO to impose a no-fly zone and for the U.S. to send troops.  As he pointed his camera to a gothic building in Kyiv, Prokorenko hoped, "one day," everyone would be able to come to Ukraine and "see how beautiful our people," "our capital" and "everything about this country is."

"Sean Patrick Maloney and Joe Biden crippled American energy production," the narrator charges in a new digital ad by the House GOP re-election arm.  The spot – which targets Maloney, a five-term congressman from New York’s 18th Congressional District and chair of the rival Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) – includes recent press headlines spotlighting what’s termed President Biden’s "war on energy" and "attack on fossil fuel."  AVERAGE PRICE OF DIESEL GAS HITS A NEW RECORD HIGH  The narrator in the ad, which was shared first with Fox News on Wednesday, then argues "now you’re paying the price," over a visual of a Wall Street Journal headline from Tuesday that reads "Gasoline Price Hits Record High."  "Tell Sean Patrick Maloney we can’t afford this," the narrator implores.  The NRCC is going up with similar ads targeting Democratic Reps. Tom O’Halleran (AZ-02) of Arizona; Sharice Davids (KS-03) of Kansas; Elissa Slotkin (MI-07) and Dan Kildee (MI-08) of Michigan; Angie Craig (MN-02) of Minnesota; Chris Pappas (NH-01) of New Hampshire; Susie Lee (NV-03) of Nevada; Elaine Luria (VA-02) of Virginia; and Kim Schrier (WA-08) of Washington state.  In a release announcing its new spots, the NRCC takes aim at the Biden administration and the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, arguing that "since taking power Democrats launched a full-scale war on energy." The NRCC points to what it calls "slow-rolling" oil and gas permits; banning new oil and gas leases on federal lands, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have brought oil from the sand fields of western Canada to the U.S.; and halting new federal support for oil and gas projects overseas.  BIDEN'S MISLEADING CLAIM ON OIL PRODUCTION NOW VERSUS UNDER TRUMP  "Joe Biden’s war on American energy began the second he took power, and now American consumers are paying the price," NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota emphasizes. "The blame for record-high gas prices lies solely at the feet of Joe Biden and House Democrats."  Gas prices nose-dived due to plummeting demand for fuel during the spring and summer of 2020, as the coronavirus, the worst pandemic to strike the globe in a century, flattened economies across the world. But prices started rising later that year and started soaring during the summer and fall of last year, amid the worst spikes in inflation in decades.  Gas prices surged even higher the past couple of months, as Russia began building up forces and threatening neighboring Ukraine, ahead of its full-scale invasion. The average national price of regular gasoline as of Wednesday, according to AAA, was $4.25 per gallon.  INFLATION SURGE A TOP WEAPON FOR REPUBLICANS IN MIDTERMS BATTLE  Republicans have been hammering congressional Democrats on inflation and on rising gas prices since last summer, as they aim to win back majorities in both the House and Senate in the 2022 midterms. The GOP needs a net gain of just five seats in the 435-member House this November to win back the majority it lost in the 2018 elections. And a rising Republican chorus has criticized Biden for handicapping the nation’s oil and gas production.  The president on Tuesday fired back against GOP attacks that his energy policies are to blame for soaring gas prices. As he announced the U.S. would ban imports of Russian oil to punish Moscow for its deadly assault on Ukraine, Biden argued that "it’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That’s simply not true."  "Even amid the pandemic, companies in the U.S. pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s first year," the president stated.  While the White House has used the comparison to former President Trump’s first year in office, in 2017, to make the point that it haven’t capped oil production, it fails to note that production was higher in 2019 under Trump, before the pandemic swept the nation.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  The president also pointed out that 90% of onshore domestic oil production takes place on nonfederal-government-owned land. And the administration, pushing back on GOP charges over the nixing of the Keystone XL pipeline permit, notes that only 8% of the pipeline was completed at that time, and that even if it had been allowed to be completed, oil wouldn’t have flowed through the pipeline until 2023.  The president also insisted that the U.S. needs to beef up investments in clean energy so Americans are not at the mercy of gas prices in the future.  Biden and his administration in recent days have also been blaming the Russian buildup and attack on Ukraine for the spike in gas prices. "Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders — just since then — the price of the gas at the pump in America went up 75 cents," the president said this week. "And with this action, it’s going to go up further.

With the coronavirus pandemic receding, the two-day meeting starting Thursday should have been devoted to optimistic discussions on the EU’s new economic growth and investment model.  Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade his neighbor turned everything upside down.  ZELENSKYY ACCUSES RUSSIA OF 'GENOCIDE' IN UKRAINIAN MATERNITY HOSPITAL BOMBING: LIVE UPDATES  With European nations united in backing Ukraine's resistance with unprecedented economic sanctions, three main topics now dominate the agenda: Ukraine's application for fast-track EU membership; how to wean the bloc off its Russian energy dependency; and bolstering the region's defense capabilities.  The EU has showed remarkable cohesion since the war started last month. It quickly adopted massive sanctions targeting Putin himself, Russia's financial system and its high-maintenance oligarchs. It also took the unprecedented step of collectively supplying weapons to a country under attack.  The EU agreed to spend 450 million euros ($500 million) on buying weapons for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Germany said it would raise defense spending above 2% of gross domestic product — and broke with a long tradition of refusing to export weapons to conflict zones when it agreed to send anti-tank and air defense missiles to Ukraine.  WHITE HOUSE OMITTED BLAME ON RUSSIA IN PREVIOUS TAP INTO US STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVES  "In stepping up European defense, we must find a consensus within the EU, that sometimes the best way of achieving peace is the willingness to use military strength," Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said.  According to a draft of the summit's conclusions obtained by The Associated Press, leaders will agree in Versailles that they "must bolster resolutely (their) investment in defense capabilities and innovative technologies," and to continue efforts to make the EU "a stronger and more capable security provider."  But two weeks into the war, divisions among leaders have started to surface on integrating Ukraine and severing energy ties with Moscow.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants his country to quickly become an EU member, but an agreement on that point won't be achieved this week.  GLOBAL ECONOMY BRACES FOR IMPACT OF RUSSIA’S WAR ON UKRAINE  The Ukrainian bid has received warm support in Eastern European countries, but EU officials have stressed the process could take years, with unanimity among current members required to allow a newcomer in the club.  "This will not happen in the short term, because this is a whole process taking many years," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Wednesday.  Another key deterrent to a hasty decision is the specific EU treaty clause that if a member falls victim to armed aggression, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all the means in their power.  "The chance of all member states agreeing to admit Ukraine while it is at war with Russia is virtually zero, as it could trigger conflict with Moscow," said Luigi Scazzieri, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.  SOME WESTERN COMPANIES DECLINE TO JOIN CORPORATE EXODUS FROM RUSSIA OVER UKRAINE INVASION  On energy, all agree that the EU should reduce its dependency on imports of Russian gas, oil and coal while accelerating the green transition. The EU imports 90% of the natural gas used to generate electricity, heat homes and supply industry, with Russia supplying almost 40% of EU gas and a quarter of its oil.  Earlier this week, the European Commission proposed to diversify natural gas supplies and speed up renewable energy development in a bid to reduce EU demand for Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of the year.  EU leaders are expected to agree on that, but it's highly unlikely they will follow Washington's lead and unanimously endorse a full embargo on Russian oil and gas imports. France won't defend what it considers a radical measure and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made clear he opposes the idea.  Efforts to agree on a boycott are complicated because some EU countries, including Germany and Italy, are much more dependent than others on Russia. Poland gets 67% of its oil from Russia, while Ireland receives only 5%.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS  Rutte said it was essential that the EU should "not (go) hastily in the direction of a complete ban on gas and oil from Russia."  "Because we are very much dependent, that’s the painful reality," he said. "(A ban) would have huge ramifications on all our economies ... but even up to Ukraine itself, because we still have to find the diesel to put in the trucks which are driving into Ukraine to help them."  Some countries could however decide to go solo and impose an embargo even without an EU deal, since members are free to make their own energy choices.

CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner mimicked many other media outlets in condemnation against Florida surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo on Wednesday.  Appearing on "The Lead with Jake Tapper," Reiner took part in a discussion on Florida’s latest health guidance that recommended healthy children should not receive the COVID-19 vaccine.  DC PARENT CALLS ON MAYOR TO ‘UNMASK KIDS AFTER ‘IGNORING’ SCHOOL MASK-WEARING GUIDANCE  "In general, healthy children with no significant underlying health conditions under 16 years old are at little to no risk of severe illness complications from COVID-19. For adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, the risk of myocarditis due to the COVID-19 vaccines may outweigh the benefits," Florida's guidance read.  Florida is the first state to make this recommendation while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has encouraged children ages 5 and up to be vaccinated.  Because of this change in guidance, Reiner declared Ladapo to be a "disgraceful surgeon general."  "Florida has a disgraceful surgeon general," Reiner said. "I think what has become abundantly clear is that children do get this virus. Most children thankfully will do fine with it, but the CDC says we’ve lost about 1,400 kids to coronavirus and thousands and thousands of children have been hospitalized. That can almost entirely be prevented by vaccination."  While Reiner acknowledged that some studies have shown vaccines to have less effect on small children, he emphasized that vaccines are still "very, very effective" against the virus.  "The surgeon general of Florida has been anti-mask, anti-vax. He’s been discredited by America’s frontline physicians. It’s an embarrassment," Reiner said.  While Ladapo’s recommendation has been debated by doctors, media outlets have overwhelmingly attacked Ladapo for his positions regarding vaccine and mask mandates.  FLORIDA RECOMMENDATION AGAINST VACCINATING HEALTHY CHILDREN DRAWS SCATHING MEDIA RESPONSE  Reiner continued to defend the use of vaccines and suggested a seasonal booster similar to the flu shot.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "When we get a flu shot, we end up getting the sniffles for a few days. And you’re home out of work for a couple days. That’s not a big deal if you’re not hospitalized, and I think we’ll get to that point with omicron where it is a seasonal virus. We’ll probably have a seasonal booster the same way we have a seasonal vaccine for influenza, and we learn to live our lives in that way," Reiner said.  Ladapo was originally appointed to his position by Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., in September. The Florida Senate officially confirmed him on Feb. 23.

FIRST ON FOX: Republicans are demanding the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to end its COVID-19 mask mandate on March 18 — the date its mandate was set to expire when it was initially extended in August 2021.  TSA extended the mandate last summer until March 18 across all transportation networks in the United States, including airports, airplanes, buses and trains.  "Given strong declines in COVID-19 cases and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) latest guidance eliminating indoor mask requirements for much of the population, we believe TSA’s mask mandate should be allowed to expire later this month," Republican Reps. Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania and Doug LaMalfa of California wrote in a letter to TSA Administrator David Pekoske exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital.  Ninety-two Republicans signed the letter in total, including House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York.  The lawmakers added that since the agency extended its mandate in August 2021, "the rolling average of new COVID-19 cases has declined by nearly two-thirds."  US PUSHED PARTNERSHIP WITH WUHAN LAB SINCE 2017 — WITH PROMISE OF ‘PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS,’ DOCUMENTS SHOW  TSA has not given any indication that it will further extend mandates by March 18.  As of last week, more than 90% of Americans live in low or moderate COVID-19-transmission areas, meaning they can stop wearing masks indoors and social distancing in line with CDC guidance.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recorded 535 unruly passenger reports related to face masks, which represents 65% of the total 814 unruly passenger reports the FAA recorded as of March 1.  NYC PARENTS PLAN TO SUE THE MAYOR OVER MASK MANDATES FOR YOUNG KIDS  "No airline employee should have to deal with unruly passengers, and we support the FAA continuing to take a hard stance against these passengers. We believe that eliminating the mask mandate will provide a safer travel experience for everyone involved. It is past time that we follow the science and allow Americans to return to normalcy," the Republicans wrote.  In late February, various travel groups including the U.S. Travel Association, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, Airlines for America and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients, asking the administration to repeal mask requirements, pre-departure COVID-19 testing, the use of travel bans and other regulations in the coming months.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Given travel’s slow economic recovery, and in light of the improved public health metrics in the U.S. and medical advancements to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19, we encourage the Administration to immediately remove travel requirements that no longer fit with the current environment and to set clear timelines and metrics for when others will be lifted," the letter stated.  Currently, not wearing a mask in airports is a federal offense that can result in fines up to $3,000.  Fox News' Kelly Laco contributed to this report.

In October 2017 – when most Americans never heard the word coronavirus, and SARS was, if anything, a distant memory – the U.S. government was planning joint research projects with China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology.  That’s when Gray Handley, associate director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, forwarded the information to colleagues that said, "China’s Interest in the Global Virome Project Presents an Opportunity for Global Health Cooperation."  "U.S.-China collaboration on the Global Virome Project is an opportunity to lead innovation in science, collaborate with China, and potentially contribute to scientific breakthroughs," said the summary of the Global Virome Project in the email that was part of 92 pages obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit with the National Institutes of Health.  The documents show that cooperation would include efforts in the coming years, such as U.S. government scientists providing training for Wuhan lab scientists in 2018. A key selling point was such a partnership would mean "pandemic preparedness" and "enable rapid detection" of viruses to prevent outbreaks. But by January 2020, U.S. health officials noted the Chinese government wasn’t being forthcoming about an outbreak, reluctant to say if it was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  The 2019 novel coronavirus, better known as COVID-19, is also known as SARS-CoV-2.  That ambitious cooperation plan raised in October 2017 between two world powers would, among other things, ensure preparedness for a future pandemic, according to the documents.  NYC PARENTS PLAN TO SUE THE MAYOR OVER MASK MANDATES FOR YOUNG KIDS  "While U.S.-based NGOs and academics are likely to provide some leadership for the GVP, it will be important for the USG [U.S. government] to remain engaged in significant ways with the GVP, to ensure that U.S. interests are adequately reflected in this effort, which will facilitate the development of countermeasures against future threats (pandemic preparedness), and enable rapid detection of viral threats and increase the capacity to handle them," the summary of the Global Virome Project says.  The State Department was also in the loop.  By Feb. 23, 2018, another email exchange between officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the National Institutes of Health headquarters referred to a Chinese media account of research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology into how bats "harbor highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola, Marburg and SARS coronavirus but do not show clinical signs of disease."  An April 18, 2018, email from an official whose name is redacted, with the subject line "Cable on Wuhan Institute of Virology visit," refers to a cable that says, "China Virus Institute Welcomes More U.S. Cooperation on Global Health Security." The cable later adds, "China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a global leader of virus research, is a key partner for the United States in protecting global health security."  This message notes that U.S. scientists were training Wuhan scientists in 2018.  "[E]xperts from the NIH-supported P4 lab at the University of Texas Medical Branch have trained Wuhan lab technicians in lab management and maintenance, institute officials said," the cable continues. "NIH was a major funder, along with China’s National Science Foundation, of SARS research by the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s [redacted]."  The same cable further notes that a redacted word "with the EcoHealth Alliance (a New York City-based NGO that is working with the University of California Davis to manage the [redacted], plans to visit Wuhan to meet with Shi [Zhengli]."  EcoHealth Alliance is a nonprofit that received about $600,000 in U.S. tax dollars. The organization spent money studying coronavirus in bats at the Wuhan lab between 2014 and 2019. The NIH sent a letter to EcoHealth Alliance in July 2020, asking about its relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Shi Zhengli is described elsewhere in the documents obtained by Judicial Watch as a scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the China country coordinator for the PREDICT project, which was a research project funded by the State Department’s U.S. Agency for International Development to fight disease. This project was described as a forerunner to the Global Virome Project.  In December 2019, the first known cases of COVID-19 emerged in China and began to spread. On Jan. 8, 2020, Dr. Ping Chen, a top NIAID official working in China, emailed senior NIAID colleagues, including Handley, with a subject line, "PRC Response to Pneumonia Cases Shows Increased Transparency Over Past Outbreaks, but Gaps in Epidemiological Data Remain."  "It has ruled out SARS, MERS, and flu. [Redacted] confirmed it is a viral infection," Chen told his colleagues.  "While PRC officials have released timely and open general information about the outbreak, a lack of epidemiologic data … characteristics of infected individuals, and other basic epidemiologic information – hinders better risk assessment and response by public health officials," the Chen email says. "Authorities have also not released information on how they are defining a ‘case.’ Given these gaps in detailed information to-date, and lack of a final confirmed pathogen, the risk to the United States and global health is difficult to assess at this time."  SEATTLE TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS FORCED MASKING UNTIL MAY TO ENSURE ‘SENSE OF NORMALCY’  Neither the NIAID nor the NIH responded with a comment for this story, though the NIH did acknowledge receipt of the inquiry.  The State Department deferred to an October report by the intelligence community.  The intelligence community assessment says, "One IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology."  But, the report says, "Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "China’s cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19," the report says. "Beijing, however, continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing information, and blame other countries, including the United States."

Workers could build the pipeline in about eight months, he estimated, adding that he is "tired of hearing" that construction would take three years to complete.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  Even if Biden approved the pipeline, the energy company that was building it would be "very hesitant to come back to the United States without some kind of concessions" after losing billions of dollars before.  "If I was that energy company, I would say, 'Hey, you're going to have to give me some of my money back that I lost the first time around. And you're going to have to give me some concrete proof that we're not going to end up in U.S. courts again.'"  As Hannity noted, pipeline jobs are "high-paying, skill-specific career jobs."

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, was the only person to voice disapproval at a congressional hearing with major companies' CEOs that saw promises to halt energy production.  "This is the great divide in America today, Sean," Jordan said. "You got the quote ‘elite’ and the crazy left who think that there's no problem having four- and five-dollar gas. And then you got Middle America, you got the working and middle-class American families [that] understand what this means."

In her "Ingraham Angle" commentary on Wednesday, host Laura Ingraham explained how, with the federal coronavirus emergency subsiding, President Biden and his administration need a new way to lock down the populace and keep them in their control.  Ingraham said the record spike in gas prices is likely intended to do just that: While the coronavirus mitigation orders enforced travel barriers and socioeconomic restrictions, the Democrats' refusal to show true concern for the oil crisis might be because such costs restrict the middle class's ability to travel and behave in everyday life.  "Are we about to face another lockdown — another period of time when Americans feel like they can't travel, they can't even maybe go to work or see family — well, not travel for pleasure anyway — only for essential activities?" Ingraham asked.  "[T]he COVID lockdowns: The foolish closures that had zero basis in science. Today, it's not a virus that may keep us from jumping in our cars and doing and going anywhere we want. It's high gas prices and inflation caused by Joe Biden's suicidal green agenda."  "And like with COVID, they're asking you to sacrifice for the 'greater good,'" she added.  "Now I'm old enough to remember when Democrats used to believe in things called hope and change," Ingraham later said.  "But now they pretty much dropped all that with Democrats, all they've done to derail America. Biden's long, dark winter is turning into a painful spring. And next, he's going to bring us a sweltering, miserable summer. And Lord knows how depressing a fall it's going to be."  Ingraham said there are parallels between today and the Carter-led 1970s: potential stagflation, gas price spikes and shortages, economic "malaise."  However, she said that just as then, now there is no naturally occurring oil shortage or force keeping inflation spiking — only the politics of the left making sure the pain is maximal.  "They believe the planet cannot sustain your standard of living and most importantly, that you don't deserve your standard of living," Ingraham said.  "They think it's high time that you, your kids, your grandkids get used to living with less. This is all a rerun of the 1970s, when we were told we had to drive more slowly, we had to turn our thermostats down in the winter and up in the summer."  "Back then, Jimmy Carter blamed the energy crisis, but remember, there was no energy crisis. We had plenty of energy in the '70s, just like we have plenty of energy now. This crisis is self-inflicted, created by leaders who seem to be enjoying punishing Americans instead of serving them, and they certainly don't think that the people deserve answers to any questions about this."  CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "This is our country. It belongs to the American people, not international bureaucrats. The salaries of every single person in the Biden administration are paid for by you and by me. So going forward, the key issue for every voter should be this: Who will put your interests first?"  "Who's going to work for you, your family, your hopes, your dreams? We know it's not Biden and the Democrats. But I think they're on the way out, I think they know that the future belongs to political leaders who help Americans triumph, not delight in their suffering."

Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe slammed President Biden for negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran Wednesday night on ‘Hannity’. Ratcliffe told Sean Hannity that Biden would rather sell out American national security and negotiate a deal with a "terrorist regime."  JOHN RATCLIFFE: Joe Biden doesn't want to face the progressive left that won't let him go back on the policies that have taken away American energy independence, have strengthened Russia … part of this Iranian nuclear deal is partly about oil. It's about getting a deal so that sanctions can be lifted and 1 million to 1.2 million barrels of Iranian oil can get on the market to relieve worldwide prices. He'd rather sell out American national security, deal with as you said, you know, a terrorist regime that you know, our own intelligence community … You know, it's just simply about not putting America first.

Three premature babies have been safely transported from Ukraine to Poland as the Russia-Ukraine war continues.  Project DYNAMO, an American civilian and ally rescue nonprofit based in Tampa, launched a mission that successfully evacuated twin baby boys and one baby girl from Kyiv on Monday, March 7.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The rescue mission, which the organization is calling "GEMINI," was accomplished with help from two doctors, two neonatal specialists, one nurse and a Ukrainian ambulance crew — and comes 11 days after Russia launched its attack on Ukraine.  Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv remains an active war zone as Russian forces continue shelling. Many families have evacuated the city and country as a result.  HALF A MILLION CHILDREN BECOME REFUGEES AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR DESTROYS HOMES AND SERVICES  In a press release, Project DYNAMO wrote that rescue volunteers report that they heard shelling "within earshot of the hospital" during their departure.  "During operational planning and execution, I was anxious because premature babies, under the best of circumstances in the best hospitals, are fragile and vulnerable," Project DYNAMO Co-founder Bryan Stern told Fox News Digital. "When we put them in a war zone surrounded by Russian artillery and troops, that presents a complicated medical situation and makes it much scarier."  "From an evacuation perspective, having to move these fragile babies through these war zones by vehicle, is wrought with peril and danger. I'm overcome with joy and happiness to be able to help the family by delivering Lenny and Moishe," Stern continued. "The Project DYNAMO team, in concert with others, all worked together to deliver these bundles of joy to two happy families. Once the operation was complete, with happy parents, I felt like a delivery room doctor introducing children to their parents for the very first time.  The babies that Project DYNAMO evacuated were transported in incubators via ambulance, which received an escort made up of the nonprofit’s volunteers.  Project DYNAMO describes its team members as "humanitarians" and says many of them are "current and former members of the U.S. military" who have experience in "special operations and intelligence communities."  FOREIGNERS WHO FLED UKRAINE AMID WAR WITH RUSSIA NOW HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME  The rescue vans traveled more than 700 miles west from Kyiv to Hospital PRO-FAMILIA in Rzeszow, Poland, where the American twin boys and the British baby girl were reunited with their families and respective national consular service providers.  Project DYNAMO reports that the GEMINI mission also led to the safe evacuation of two Ukrainian women and a British couple.  So far, the organization reports that 150 civilians have been rescued in 14 missions.  UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'  The nonprofit has received more than 14,000 evacuation requests from people around the world in relation to the Russia-Ukraine war, including the U.S., U.K, Canada, France, Romania, Nigeria, Mexico and Afghanistan.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  Evacuation requests have also come from "citizens and residents from other European nations," Project DYNAMO wrote in its release, "many of whom include children and the elderly and members of the Jewish community in Ukraine."  Updated evacuation numbers from the United Nations state that more than two million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its attack on the country on Feb. 24, 2022.  The intergovernmental agency estimates that these evacuation numbers could potentially double.  KYIV ZOO STAFF, FAMILIES HIDE AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IN 'ZOO MILITARY COMMUNE'  A Monday press release from UNICEF says "hundreds of thousands" of Ukraine evacuees are children and many of them "are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members."  As the fight between Russia and Ukraine shows no sign of slowing at this time, Project DYNAMO reports that it will continue evacuation operations.  It recommends that people in need of help submit Ukraine evacuation requests on projectdynamo.org and through the U.S. State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

Prayer vigils and rallies for peace are being held by concerned citizens in the U.S. and around the globe as Ukraine battles the Russian invasion.  Youth groups and schools throughout the country are doing their part to send well wishes to the people directly impacted by the war and protest the clashes that were started by the Russian Armed Forces on Thursday, Feb. 24.  Anna Cirilli, the principal of the St. Nicholas Cathedral School in Chicago told Fox News Digital that students have been organizing prayer vigils to show support for family members and friends who are still in Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The students and staff continue to pray for peace for Ukraine," Cirilli said.  In a written vigil excerpt from Monday, Feb. 28, which was provided to Fox News Digital, the St. Nicholas Cathedral School prayed for the safety and protection of all those affected by the war.  "There are people that are protecting their land by fighting in the armed services, volunteer battalions, and militias. These people are heroes, they are the pride of the country for putting their lives on the line for the safety of Ukraine and for all of Europe," St. Nicholas Cathedral School vigil participants said during their prayer. "There are innocent civilians that are paying the price of a war that they did not want. Too many people have become refugees, while others remain in hiding."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  The prayer vigil participants continued their invocation by noting that families are being separated and are unsure of when they’ll be able to see each other again.  "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not new, but Ukraine is its own independent country with its own history, beliefs, culture, language, and traditions," vigil participants said.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  The Ukrainian American Youth Association – an American branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM), a patriotic and faith-based nonprofit scouting organization – has been spreading awareness about prayer vigils and peaceful protests throughout the country.  Two days before Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv, the Ukrainian American Youth Association had urged its members to contact the White House to honor the Budapest Memorandum and put sanctions on Russia on Facebook. The organization’s call to "help Ukraine" came about after weeks of tension grew between the two countries as Russia built up its military near Ukraine’s borders.  The organization’s Ohio youth chapter CYM Cleveland was one of the first to hold a "Cleveland Pray for Ukraine" event before Russia’s attack, according to a news post from the Ukrainian Youth Association website.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  Several other chapters have gone on to host prayer vigils, including the organization’s Illinois chapter CYM (AUYA) Palatine, which held an initial church service on Thursday, where members prayed for families in Ukraine at the Immaculate Conception Church.  Fox News Digital reached out to the Ukrainian American Youth Association for comment.  Outside of prayer, the organization has been keeping the public in the loop with Facebook posts about war reports and peace events that are happening in the U.S.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  On Thursday, the Ukrainian American Youth Association highlighted a "STOP PUTIN" rally in NYC. Three days later, the organization shared a Change.org petition calling for a "No-Russian-Fly-Zone over Ukraine" and highlighted peaceful demonstrations that took place in Boston and in front of the White House.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  The Ukrainian American Youth Association has 28 chapters in 12 U.S. states. It reportedly works in conjunction with branches of the Ukrainian Youth Association in eight countries.

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern will be in attendance at Taste of the NFL – a pre-Super Bowl LVI culinary experience that aims to combat childhood hunger and food insecurity by raising funds and awareness for vulnerable groups.  Zimmern told FOX News Edge that he got involved with the annual benefit through his work with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization GENYOUth, which has partnered with Taste of the NFL for Super Bowl 2022. The two anti-hunger charities are organizing a ticketed live event at the world-renowned Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb. 12, where food and football will collide.  "Folks can come and participate, come down to interact with incredible chefs and the performance that we're doing with the demos live on stage as well as, you know, have a fantastic party with a purpose to raise money [and] provide hunger solutions for students in schools, which is what GENYOUth now specializes in," Zimmern said in a video interview with FOX. "They're one of the leaders in the country at this, and we're trying to raise as much money as possible."  FRIED HONEY BUTTER CHICKEN BISCUITS FOR YOUR NFL FOOTBALL PARTY: TRY THE RECIPE  He noted that childhood hunger has been exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation continue. These two challenges are especially concerning for Zimmern, who has been a hunger relief advocate for 30 years and has worked with various equity boards, including the New York-based Services for the UnderServed, the International Rescue Committee and more recently the United Nations World Food Programme as a goodwill ambassador.  "I haven't come across a problem that is as deadly and as crisis-filled as the global and national hunger crisis that we are currently enduring," Zimmern said. "I'm staggered by this… To me, it is the biggest head-scratcher of head-scratchers."  Zimmern went on to say that while he’s grateful nongovernmental organizations have stepped up to combat hunger, he wants the world to realize that a society that’s eliminated hunger with nutritious foods is likely to face economic and public health benefits, including less money spent on preventable food-related diseases, an improvement to national security, decreased pressure on the criminal justice system and overall productivity.  FOOTBALL BUTTERCREAM SUGAR COOKIES FOR GAME DAY DESSERT: TRY THE RECIPE  In his own words, "Food is both a tool for understanding other people, and it's also a solution to improving lives both here in America and around the world."  For citizens who would like to show their support for Taste of the NFL and GENYOUth, but won’t be able to attend the live event on Saturday, Zimmern said spreading the word about these two organizations or joining The Virtual Home Gate would be helpful.  The digital experience will include demos from celebrity chefs Carla Hall, Tim Love, Lasheeda Perry and Mark Bucher who going to be at the live event as well. Viewers will also be able to see discussion snippets from special guests, which NFL players, professional athletes and media personalities.

"Thanksgiving used to be the biggest food day in America. Number two was Christmas. Number three was Fourth of July. Now, number one is [the] Super Bowl. People watch football at home with their loved ones and they cook.  He continued, "As someone who loves educating, who loves providing adventure and joy in the kitchen and believes in putting food on people's plates, what a wonderful time of year, both to be celebrating food, but also raising money for a fantastic cause and making sure that those that don't have food are provided for."

Zimmern explained that remoulade – a French sauce – had been influenced by Spanish, Caribbean and West African flavors by the time it made its way to Louisiana.  Zimmern makes his recipe with a shrimp boil mixed with mustard seeds, chile fennel, lemon slices, chopped celery and onions, a can of beer and other seasonings, and he lets the ingredients simmer and steep at 200 degrees for 20 minutes or so.  In a food processor, Zimmern makes the remoulade from scratch with chile and Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, eggs, chopped scallions and celery, minced garlic, a spice mix with whole mustard seeds, horseradish, white vinegar and Old Bay seasoning.  Zimmern recommends pulsing the processor a few times before pouring in vegetable oil and letting it emulsify. After the ingredients blend together, the remoulade can be refrigerated while the shrimp cooks.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  When the shrimp batch is done cooking, Zimmern places the shellfish in a colander with a bowl underneath to catch excess liquid. He then covers the shrimp with ice to trap the flavor. Zimmern serves the shrimp with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, lemon wedges, Cajun seasonings, celery leaves and the remoulade sauce.  "Shrimp remoulade is one of the fastest, tastiest, most delicious treats that you could possibly imagine," Zimmern told FOX.  "I don't think there's a better dish. You [can] do it all ahead of time and simply pour the sauce on right before your guests get there. They can dip if they want. They can plate if they want. You can make a big batch, a small batch. You can do this with other meats or seafood or everything if you don't like shrimp, but I think it's fantastic."

China has shown its true colors. The regime in Beijing has been an enabler, supporter, underwriter, excuse-maker, and propagandist for Putin’s brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.  Before the war, in a bid to get China to convince Putin to stop his troop buildup along the border, President Biden foolishly shared U.S. intelligence with Beijing. Rather than restraining Moscow, China handed over the cache of American info to Putin.  CHINA ACCUSES US OF ‘BIOLOGICAL MILITARY ACTIVITIES’ IN UKRAINE  European leaders would be equally foolish to look to China for help. They must recognize that Beijing is pleased Putin is doing their work for them, pushing to weaken, destabilize, and divide Europe. An effort to restrain Moscow is the last thing the West should expect from Beijing.  Yet false hope still lives in some quarters. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, recently told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that he supports Chinese mediation in the Russian-Ukrainian war.  "There is no alternative," he said. "We [Europeans] cannot be the mediators, that is clear.… And it cannot be the U.S., either. Who else? It has to be China; I trust in that."  This is a proposal unconnected to reality.  Let's start by pointing out Xi Jinping is on Putin’s side. At the outbreak of hostilities, Beijing immediately announced it would not join the western financial sanctions against Moscow. It also abstained on the UN resolution strongly condemning the invasion.  Rather than restraining Moscow, China handed over the cache of American info to Putin.  Since the invasion, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has described relations between China and Russia as "rock solid." Indeed, China and Russia have issued a joint statement reiterating Beijing’s support for Moscow's position opposing NATO expansion eastward. Moreover, they have consolidated their relationships in the financial and energy sectors.  CHIEF INTERNATIONAL PROSECUTOR WARNS 'TYRANTS' LIKE CHINA WILL ACT IF PUTIN NOT PUNISHED  Why would China want Russia to stop when Putin has served as a stalking horse for all the Chinese Communist Party’s priorities? Beijing hopes that the Ukrainian crisis will stretch the Americans like a rubber band, making the U.S. unable to pay attention to Europe and Asia at the same time.  Beijing is also betting that Russian aggression against Ukraine will weaken NATO and transatlantic relations. Russia and China hope that the dependence of some European countries on Russian gas and French proposals for European strategic autonomy (without the Americas) will further weaken and divide the Atlantic Alliance in a time of crisis. Xi is also banking on the current political and diplomatic crisis making Moscow even more economically dependent on Beijing, making the Kremlin even more compliant in serving’s China interests.  Clearly, putting China in the role of mediator, as Borrell suggests, could only make matters worse for the West. Beijing is interested only in increasing its geopolitical advantage, and this is a risk for the European Union above all. Russia has recently strengthened its gas supply links with China, making it less dependent on Western sales to fuel its economy.  Additionally, both Moscow and Beijing are increasing their influence over large parts of Africa. In particular, the Russians have a growing weight on eastern Libya and the Sahel region. Africa is functional to the geopolitical bloc that China and Russia are building, with the aim of marginalizing the United States and dividing Europeans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Instead of relying on Beijing, Brussels should therefore strive to counter Sino-Russian geopolitical pressure. It should consolidate transatlantic relations by reestablishing clear energy autonomy, strengthening its borders on land and sea, and building NATO into a stronger military stiff arm to foreign aggression.  It is also time to make hard choices. EU countries, starting with Germany, should reexamine their ties with Beijing. Start by keeping the highly controversial EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in the "freezer." This is no time to expand economic ties. Biden, for his part, should understand that Beijing is not a reliable mediator, since it has every interest in undermining transatlantic relations.

As Russian forces solidify their stranglehold on Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy must be prepared to stand up a government in exile if the capital falls.  Vlad the Invader seeks to install a puppet regime in Kyiv as soon as his tanks and troops occupy the city. At that point, it will be too late for Zelenskyy, or any of his senior ministers, to escape death or captivity.  War demands hard choices. And now President Zelenskyy faces a dramatic stay-or-leave decision as the Russian army converges upon him.  UKRAINE'S FIGHTING COSSACK SPIRIT – STALINIST PUTIN WON'T PREVAIL  Zelenskyy has shown tremendous courage by staying in Kiev since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this month. His decision clearly stiffened the will of the Ukrainian military to resist and inspired ordinary citizens to take up arms.  But there is something to be said for living to fight another day. The decision to relocate is not the same as raising a white flag. Far from it. It would represent a prudential choice to continue the fight from a more secure foxhole.  No one faulted Charles de Gaulle when he established a government in exile in London during World War II. Nor was he alone. Eight other allied governments, to include Norway, Belgium and Poland, set up shop in London, helping to mobilize military forces in exile to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny.  Closer to home, recall that President James Madison left the White House for a spell as the British torched Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.  No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp elsewhere.  No one should begrudge Zelenskyy now if he decides to set up camp elsewhere. He has already earned his street cred as a national leader. As so-called target number one, he has endured great personal risk since day one of the Russian invasion.  What are the options if he decides to relocate? Zelenskyy could relocate to the western part of Ukraine, the only part of the country that has remained relatively unscathed from Russian attack so far. But this would likely buy his government only a few days before the Russian armored columns pivot in hot pursuit.  There are other alternatives. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already extended an invitation to Zelenskyy. If not London, then perhaps someplace closer to Ukraine might do. Warsaw could be an attractive option, since Poland borders Zelenskyy’s home country and has already accepted a record number of Ukrainian refugees.  Zelenskyy is his own man. He may well choose to resist until death in Kyiv. If so, he will die a hero’s death. Or he may opt to continue the resistance from elsewhere.  "I need ammunition, not a ride," he famously declared a few days ago. Well, he has successfully secured ammunition for the resistance, with weapons pouring in from the United States, Canada and numerous European countries (even Germany has joined!).  What the Ukraine government needs most right now is to ensure its own survival given the increasingly barbaric Russian onslaught. Whether he stays in Kyiv or not, Zelenskyy must lay the groundwork for a government in exile, to ensure his government survives if Kyiv falls to the invader.  A government in exile will help ensure that Ukraine maintains its proper seat in international fora, to include the United Nations.  The government in exile can also spearhead the international effort to support the resistance with Ukraine, as well as a humanitarian assistance campaign to deal with the impact of Moscow’s naked aggression. Zelenskyy, or his designated successor, will have the freedom to rally support around the globe. In contrast, Putin will likely remain holed up in Moscow or one his secret lairs, an international pariah.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Setting up a government-in-exile for a country of more than 40 million people is no small feat. Beyond providing diplomatic support and defensive weaponry to Ukraine, the United States should be prepared to assist a government in exile with immediate assistance -- computers, secure communications, office equipment and security -- wherever Zelenskyy directs his government to set up camp.  Whatever his decision, President Zelenskyy has already left his mark on history with his exemplary courage. By setting up a government in exile, he will help to ensure his country’s future.

A "hero" Florida trooper drove her patrol car directly into a speeding drunk driver who was barreling toward a 10K route where thousands of runners were participating on Sunday, authorities said.  The Florida Highway Patrol released dashcam video showing the moment Master Trooper Toni Schuck, 47, put herself into harm’s way on I-275 in the Tampa Bay area.  FLORIDA SHERIFF'S OFFICE ASSISTING UKRAINE, SENDING HUNDREDS OF BALLISTIC HELMETS  The drunken driver shown in the video was speeding toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, where thousands of runners were participating in the Skyway 10K to raise money for military families.  "This driver had blown past several check points, going around traffic cones, going around other officers and had engaged in high speeds," aid Trooper Ken Watson on Monday afternoon, FOX13 Tampa reported.  Schuck is seen turning her patrol vehicle directly into the path of the drunk driver and then the two vehicles crash head-on.  "Thank you for your bravery and self-sacrifice, Trooper Schuck," the FHP said. "We wish you a speedy recovery."  Both Schuck and the drunk driver, identified as 52-year-old Kristen Kay Watts suffered serious injuries, FOX13 Tampa reported. Schuck, has served in law enforcement for 26 years, was recovering at home with her family on Tuesday.  She was home recovering from a head wound and concussion.  Watts was booked into the Manatee County Jail on a $52,000 bond. She faces charges of DUI-serious injury, two counts of DUI-property damage and two counts of reckless driving involving injury and property damage.  She was wheeled into the jail on Monday afternoon.  "I'll need the public defender," she said.

A water engineering nonprofit has sent a team to Ukraine's borders and neighboring countries in order to assess the safe water, sanitation and hygiene needs of tens of thousands of displaced refugees.  Water Mission's rapid responders, who are working alongside other humanitarian organizations in the region, are in the midst of determining where the biggest populations of refugees are. Once that's determined, they look into what safe water resources they can tap into, or if any safe water resources exist, in order to determine how to bring emergency safe water systems where they are needed most.  HELPING UKRAINIAN REFUGEES: NONPROFIT DELIVERING THOUSANDS OF HOT MEALS TO PEOPLE IN NEED  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  "As it becomes clear what role we're going to play, then we'll send over all the staff we need to run our response," Water Mission Senior Director Global Partnerships John Peays told Fox News.  Since 2001, the nonprofit has been implementing safe water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions for developing countries and disaster areas. To date, they have helped over seven million people in 57 countries.  One of the biggest areas of need during the current crisis, Peays projected, will be right on Ukraine's borders, where there is a build-up of cars, buses, and refugees on foot trying to escape into neighboring countries.  In fact, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted Monday that some wait times at Ukraine's borders are nearing 50 hours.  During any crisis, Water Missions CEO George Greene said "the need for emergency safe water access is critical for survival."  For instance, Greene told Fox News that "you can very quickly get into a situation where improvised water sources like shallow wells and trying to get water out of the ground, or even people drinking water directly out of rivers and nearby areas… get contaminated with human waste in an excessive way."  It can lead to water-borne illnesses and the worst case is when "cholera outbreaks happen," he said.  Cholera, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a "diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria."  People can get sick once they swallow food or water that has been contaminated with the bacteria, the CDC explains.

Images coming in from Ukraine's western borders showing streams of people desperately leaving their beloved country behind and trudging their way into safer havens such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are tugging at Americans' heartstrings — and bringing a vivid and stark awareness of the humanitarian toll that Russia's attacks on Ukraine are taking on innocent civilians.  "The Russian military is targeting civilians deliberately, to place pressure on Zelenskyy to capitulate," Rebekah Koffler, author of "Putin's Playbook," told Fox News Digital.  And these people are the lucky ones, tragically.  Many Ukrainians already have been killed in their country by invading Russians, according to multiple reports, images and video.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  A photojournalist shared the images you see in this article with Fox News Digital exclusively.  He has been on the western border of Ukraine capturing the up-close and personal struggles of Ukrainian families — mostly women and children — as they seek refuge after the war brutally chased them out of their homes.  The numbers are startling: On Tuesday, March 8, the head of the United Nation's refugee agency said the number of people fleeing Ukraine has now reached 2 million or more.  As many of 1 million of these refugees are said to be children.  AS UKRAINE'S REFUGEES SEEK SAFETY, ONE EXPERT SAYS US ‘CAN'T BE PARALYZED'  In addition, Filippo Grandi — the refugee agency head — warned that the second wave of refugees is likely to be in even more danger than the first wave of individuals were.  "The amount and the level of atrocities being committed against innocent Ukrainians by the Russians right now is just outrageous and completely unacceptable," Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of "Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America," told Fox News Digital on Tuesday afternoon.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR FORCES AMERICANS TO RECONSIDER TRAVEL TO EUROPE  Below as well is yet another heartbreaking image as a result of the Russia war on Ukraine.  Koffler also told Fox News Digital, "For [the city of] Kyiv, it's going to be a very brutal few weeks ahead. Yes, Ukrainians are being tremendous and showing a tremendous will to fight, and yes, Zelenskyy has been an incredible hero ... Obviously our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people." She added that there's a very high risk of miscalculation in the days and weeks ahead.  TEXAS VETERAN SENDING CAMOUFLAGE TO UKRAINIANS, SAYS DONATIONS ARE ‘POURING IN’  She said as well, "The Russian military is targeting civilians deliberately, to place pressure on Zelenskyy to capitulate, by inflicting the intolerable level of suffering on Ukrainian people.

One of the most memorable images to date from the border shows how mothers from other countries are doing their part to help struggling Ukrainian moms who are in transit and fleeing for their lives during this tragedy.  On International Women's Day — March 8, 2022 — it's worth pausing for an extra beat on that one to consider how people who don't even know each other, people who never met and likely never will, are reaching out to others in need.

A Ukrainian American mother in Iowa is hoping her son can reunite with his wife and 1-year-old son as he remains behind the Ukraine border amid the Russia-Ukraine war.  Irena Laura Yoder of Dubuque, Iowa, told Fox News Digital she urged her son TJ — whose surname she wanted omitted for privacy reasons — to flee the city of Kyiv as the world braced for Russian troops to act under Vladimir Putin’s command.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I told them, ‘You need to leave the country,'" Yoder said.  "I trust the news in the U.S. and I saw what Biden was saying. I said, ‘There’s going to be a war,'" she relayed to Fox News Digital.  Yoder, a Ukraine native, said the invasion has been a "long time coming."  "Putin hates Ukraine," Yoder said bluntly. "He hates the people and the Ukrainian language. He wanted to completely destroy and scratch off from the earth the Ukrainian word … no country, no such thing."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘HUMANITARIAN SITUATION DETERIORATING RAPIDLY’  Yoder left Ukraine with TJ in 1998 for a new life in the U.S. after escaping from an abusive relationship, she said.  "My [youngest] son Dimitri called me and said, ‘Hi, Mom.’ His voice was shaking. I said, ‘Is it morning?’ He said, ‘No.' I knew it was a war." — Irena Laura Yoder to Fox News Digital  "Also, because of some political views," Yoder added.  "It still was the Soviet Union before and still lots of political pressure and communism was around. It was very corrupt. I didn’t like that."  Yoder, a mother of two, has a 20-year-old son currently attending college in Iowa.  Her son TJ, 35, was living in Ukraine with his wife Viktoria and their 1-year-old son, Mark, when Russia invaded in late February.  UKRAINE'S DISPLACED CHILDREN REUNITED WITH MOMS IN POLAND  "On the 24th, I went to bed that night. I work at the hospital," Yoder said.  "My [youngest] son Dimitri called me and said, ‘Hi, Mom.’ His voice was shaking. I said, ‘Is it morning?’ He said, ‘No.' Then, I knew it was a war."  Yoder said TJ called her next.  "He’s like, ‘Mom, they started bombing. They started war,'" Yoder said, adding that TJ said he heard sirens.  "It was awful," she added. "So scary."  TJ and his family packed their car and left Kyiv for the Poland border, though TJ was unable to cross, since Ukrainian officials banned men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the nation.  A million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, according to the United Nations.  "I pray every day to see my family again even though I have a feeling, time to time, I might not." — TJ, son of Irena Laura Yoder  Yoder said her daughter-in-law was adamant about not separating from TJ. Yet their young son Mark has cysts on his brain and severe neurological issues — which require medical attention.  TJ, who’s currently sheltering roughly 80 miles outside the border, told Fox News Digital he’s willing to fight, though there aren’t enough weapons and gear as of now.

Donations of unloaded rifles, shotguns, or AR-15s or other long gun weapons from legal gun owners are to be sent to the Ukrainian people.  As for food and water, TJ said his situation is "OK."  "Lots of shelves are starting to be empty, depending [on] what region a person is in," he said.

"She [my wife] wants us to reunite and live as we lived before without our terror," TJ added.  Yoder said the last time she saw her son was in September, during a trip to Ukraine. Now, she’s following his journey through war.  "When I told him I worry about him, he said, ‘Mom, if you cry I cry, you laugh I laugh, you die I die,’" Yoder said, adding that her son is ready to "go to war" and protect his family.

For borrowers in some U.S. states, the debt burden is even greater.  The average student loan debt among the class of 2020 ranges from $18,350 in Utah to $39,950 in New Hampshire, according to a new report by The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS). The map below shows the average student loan balance among bachelor's degree recipients in each state.  The average debt upon graduation was more than $30,000 in 19 states, and it exceeded $35,000 in six states: New Hampshire ($39,928), Delaware ($39,705), Pennsylvania ($39,375), Rhode Island ($36,791), Connecticut ($35,853) and New Jersey ($35,117).  "Despite flattening levels of student loan debt in recent years, the debt of graduating classes has remained near an all-time high, and the debt borrowers hold continues to make their lives financially perilous," said TICAS President Sameer Gadkaree.  Keep reading to learn more about where borrowers have the highest and lowest student loan debt balances, as well as alternative student loan repayment options like refinancing. You can compare student loan refinance rates across multiple private lenders on Credible's online marketplace.  7 IN 10 PARENTS SPENT MORE ON COLLEGE TUITION AND FEES THAN THEY EXPECTED  Where borrowers have the most student loan debt  Graduates in New Hampshire, Delaware and Pennsylvania have the highest average student loan debt — in all three states, the average student loan balance upon graduation exceeds $39,000. Of the top 10 states with the highest student loan debt balances, all of them are in the New England or mid-Atlantic regions of the Northeast.  Generally, student loan borrowers in the Northeast have more student loan debt than those who live in Southern and Western states. There are a few exceptions, though, with some borrowers in the Midwest and the South graduating with high levels of debt:  No. 11 South Carolina ($32,635)  No. 12 South Dakota ($32,029)  No. 13 Minnesota ($32,012)  No. 14 North Dakota ($31,939)  No. 15 Alabama ($30,996)  In many of the states with elevated student loan balances, the total cost of attending a four-year public or nonprofit institution is higher. The average cost of college in Massachusetts is $53,853, which is still much more expensive than in New Hampshire ($45,393), the state with the highest average debt balance. In New York, the total cost of attendance is $46,955 — but borrowers have just $30,951 worth of debt on average.  In the District of Columbia, which has the ninth-highest student loan debt balances, the cost of college is the most expensive at $64,354. That's nearly double the average student debt amount in the nation's capital, suggesting that many D.C. students rely on financing methods besides loans to pay for college.  If you're looking for ways to repay high amounts of student loan debt, consider refinancing while student loan interest rates are near record lows. You can browse current student loan refinance rates in the table below, and visit Credible to see your estimated interest rate for free without impacting your credit score.  HOW CAN BORROWERS RECOVER FROM STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT?  Where borrowers have the least student loan debt  Graduates in some states are fortunate to have lower amounts of student loan debt when compared to the national average. Still, No. 1 Utah is the only state to have an average student loan debt below $20,000.  Almost every state where graduates have low student loan balances is located in the American West. Student loan borrowers in New Mexico ($20,868), California ($21,125), Nevada ($21,357), Wyoming ($23,510) and Washington ($23,993) have much more manageable levels of debt than those who live in Northeastern states.  The total cost of college tends to be cheaper in states with lower levels of student loan debt. In Utah, the state with the least student loan debt per borrower, the average cost of obtaining a college degree is $20,769. There are two states where the cost of college is below $20,000: Wyoming ($19,960) and Idaho ($19,296).  In some states, the average student loan balance exceeds the total cost of college. This is likely because there are hidden college expenses, such as rent and food costs, that may require students to borrow extra money to complete their education. If you borrowed more student loan debt than you can repay and are considering refinancing for better terms, use Credible's student loan refinance calculator to see your potential savings.  THIS IS THE STATE WHERE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF DELINQUENCY  Strategies for repaying your student loans  Even among the states with the lowest amounts of student debt, repaying these loans can be difficult. If you're struggling to repay student loans, consider the following options:  Enroll in an income-driven repayment plan (IDR), which limits your monthly federal student loan payments to 10-20% of your disposable income. You can learn more about IDR plans on the Federal Student Aid website.  Work for a company that offers student loan repayment assistance. About two in five large companies plan on offering this benefit in the next two years, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.  Refinance to a private student loan at a lower interest rate. Student loan refinancing may be able to help you reduce your monthly payments, get out of debt faster and save money on interest charges over time.  It's important to note that refinancing your federal student loan debt into a private loan will make you ineligible for government protections, such as COVID-19 emergency forbearance, IDR plans and select student loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).  You can learn more about student loan refinancing by getting in touch with a knowledgeable loan expert at Credible who can help you decide if this debt repayment strategy is right for your circumstances.

As the Russia-Ukraine War escalates, cable news ratings have skyrocketed. But look at what they’re showing you: Social media posts and online influencers.  There's no question the Ukraine invasion is a social media war — the world's first. Many TV interviews are with Ukrainians who are garnering large social media followings. TikTok is filled with video clips of after bombing scenes and bomb shelters. They are shot on smartphones by citizens and shared directly with the world, bypassing traditional media outlets.  Here at home, my connections in the cybersecurity world say cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated and will target businesses and ordinary citizens like you and me. Tap or click here for five things you need to update right now, starting with your router .  Among genuine posts and videos you’re bound to run into fakes, old footage, and misleading information. Here’s how to spot the junk, so you don't unwittingly share it.  Have a critical eye  Sharing is always one click away on social media. Not many people take the time to research before spreading an article, photo, or video — especially when it comes from a friend or online personality you trust.  Russia's propaganda machine is operating at full throttle. Using artificial intelligence, Russia is creating fake accounts of Ukrainians who supposedly agree with the invasion of their country on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, and Twitter.  These accounts say Ukraine is a "failed state," and President Volodymyr Zelensky is "building a neo-Nazi dictatorship." The accounts often say the person works for a news organization or represents some political movement in Ukraine to build credibility.  Want to see an example? Meet Vladimir Bondarenko.  NBC News Senior Reporter Brian Collins discovered Vladimir Bondarenko and posted about him that, "He’s a blogger from Kiev who really hates the Ukrainian government. He also doesn’t exist, according to Facebook. He’s an invention of a Russian troll farm targeting Ukraine. His face was made by AI."  If you look closely at Vladimir Bondarenko’s face, there appears to be a piece missing out of the top of his left ear. That’s the problem with AI. It often misses the details.  Have you ever looked at an image and had an eerie feeling that something was off? Listen to your intuition.  Are there landmarks or notable buildings in a photo? What time of year is it? Can you see any clocks or other indicators of time?  It’s not just repurposed photos, either. Today’s deepfake technology makes it relatively easy to fake just about anything. Tap or click for 10 Russia-Ukraine war scams and cons spreading right now .  Find the first use  Old images and videos tend to go viral during a conflict, natural disaster, or emergency. Following the Russian invasion into Ukraine, a video of a dramatic explosion was shared tens of thousands of times. The footage was actual, but it showed the 2020 blast in Beirut.  There are a few tools that can help you spot recycled content. Start with Google Images.  You can search the internet using an image instead of words. When you run a photo through Google Images, it will search and find other images like it so you can determine the photo’s origin. It will also pull up modified and amended versions.  To search for an image, you can:  Drag the image to the Google Images search field .  . Copy the image’s URL and paste it into the search engine.  Right-click on any image in Chrome and hit "Search Google for image."  TinEye.com is another reverse image search option . Photos are checked against its in-house index, containing over 52.6 billion images.  Pro Tip: Are you usually scrolling social media or news sites on your phone? Tap or click for a few ways to do a reverse image search from your smartphone .  Go on a fact-finding mission  Whether you’re looking at photos, videos, or just text, the more facts you know, the harder you are to fool. Where should you start? Many news organizations are dedicating resources to debunking phony viral content. Here’s a list of fact checks done by the Associated Press .  Independent groups are doing the same. Bellingcat is "an independent international collective of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists" researching info spreading on the Russia-Ukraine War. Tap or click here for a list of Bellingcat’s fact-checked claims .  Metadata tells a story, too  Not everyone who posts photos or videos online realizes those files contain a lot of identifying information. Are you giving away more than you realize? Tap or click to see how you can sleuth out details in your own photos or photos saved to your computer or phone .  If you run across a photo and want to know where it came from or when it was shot, use an online tool to examine the metadata. Try exifdata or metapicz to see if you can turn up any interesting information. You can look at metadata using editing software like Photoshop, too.  One thing to note is that social media sites often strip out metadata to protect user privacy. Unless a photo is shared with you directly or through a messaging app, you may have more luck using Google Images or TinEye.  Report false and misleading posts when you see them  If you come across fake images or misleading posts, report them. Whether that’s Facebook or a reputable news site, take the time to point out that the information is incorrect.  With fake images comes false information, and that can cause serious problems. Do your part to discern fact from fiction early and often.

Between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing cyberattacks, experts are warning about malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S., and some U.S. security pros spoke to Fox News about how to defend against technological assaults.  Russia is not likely to take President Biden’s new sanctions sitting down and has proven to be highly adept at cyber warfare, which has become part and parcel of active "kinetic" wars in the 21st century.  "This is not something to take lightly — cyber attacks don’t have borders," Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a tweet.  "I remain particularly concerned about the reports of cyber attacks…There’s historical precedent to suggest these could be devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire countries," Warner said in another tweet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russia has already launched what appears to be a series of cyberattacks on targets in the Ukraine. This past week, cyberattacks impacted the websites of several Ukrainian government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, according to Ukrainian officials. This follows cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites and banks that have been attributed to the Russian military spy agency GRU.  How to defend yourself from Russian cyber warfare ‘spillover’  As Sen. Warner suggested, cyberattacks don’t have borders. As a result, cyber spillover campaigns could reach the U.S.  "With the Ukraine conflict now front and center and poised to widen, we expect a surge of cybersecurity attacks from Russia state-sponsored organizations," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, told Fox News in a written statement.  Here’s what to watch out for and how to defend yourself, according to cybersecurity experts that Fox News spoke with.  --Ransomware: The bane of InfoSec professionals, ransomware attacks lock out companies and individuals from critical data. Attackers then demand hefty payments. "Businesses across the U.S. should be bracing for a variety of cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware," said John Dickson, vice president at Coalfire, a Westminster, Colorado-based provider of cybersecurity advisory services.  "Make sure that all critical and all internet-facing systems are fully patched to mitigate ransomware and data destruction," Lou Steinberg, cyber expert and founder of CTM Insights, told Fox News. "Use multi-factor authentication to log in to critical systems … and to prevent unauthorized changes (like turning off power or opening a valve on a dam)," Steinberg said.  --Denial of service attacks: Denial of Service, which renders critical computer services unavailable, and ransomware attacks are often "outsourced," according Steinberg. "Rather than the government directly performing them, they tend to be done by groups who believe they are being patriots by defending Russia's interests. It’s in [that] government's interest to enable this as it gives them deniability. You can’t trace an attack back to the Kremlin," Steinberg explained.  These outsourced actors "may be less capable" so companies can protect themselves if they take prudent cybersecurity measures, according to Steinberg.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: UKRAINE TO GET $350M MORE IN US DEFENSE AID: BLINKEN  --Social engineering campaigns: These attacks manipulate human behavior and "piggyback off of the news cycle," said Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions, at Lookout, a San Francisco, Calif.-based endpoint-to-cloud security company.  "Be especially vigilant about where you’re sharing data, who has access to it and the identity of anyone with whom you have interactions online," Schless said.  --Passwords: Consumers should always use multi-factor authentication and avoid reusing the same password across accounts/services, Alex Ondrick, director of security operations at BreachQuest, an Augusta, Georgia-based incident response company, told Fox News.  Ondrick said consumers can use sites like haveibeenpwned to see if they’ve been impacted by a security breach. "Regularly rotate passwords, especially on email/social media accounts, and for Wi-Fi and home router(s)," Ondrick said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  --Banking apps: "Consumers should be on the lookout for phishing and malware attacks, especially when accessing banking apps," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said. Consumers should use antivirus products as well as software that protects their identities, Ives added.  --Software updates: For individuals, it is important to follow cybersecurity best practices. That includes "installing recommended software and app updates, backing up their data and exercising caution when clicking links in emails, social media posts and online articles," Jonathan K. Osborne, a business litigation attorney at the Florida-based Gunster law firm, told Fox News.  --FBI: The FBI has a Cyber Threat website with tips and preventative measures on everything from email compromise to phishing and ransomware.

As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.  The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.  "Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred," FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.  Shah tells FOX News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal. Several parodies of Tom Cruise and other actors exist online.  TOM CRUISE DEEPFAKES ON TIKTOK POINT TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REALISTIC PHONY VIDEOS  The FBI gets involved if the video violates any federal laws, like extortion or fraud. Shah gave FOX News example of the voice of a company executive being manipulated.  "The same inflection. The same accent, and they make a phone call and you can ask the employee as the CEO, to wire that money."  A similar situation happened in Hong Kong as part of an international heist that is still under investigation.  While the FBI won't specifically comment on deepfakes as part of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, other intelligence sources say they are on the lookout for altered videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key players.

"Probably the more emotionally provocative it is, the more important it is to confirm the sources."

Many Christians across the country and around the world are celebrating Ember Days today — Wednesday, March 9, 2022 — as well as on Friday and Saturday of this week as part of their 2022 Lenten observances.  Explaining that Ember Days are "old-fashioned, traditional" observances perhaps going as far back as the fifth century A.D., Rev. Canon Victor Lee Austin, theologian-in-residence for the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas, Texas, told Fox News Digital in an interview that these special days are a time to pray for "the ministry of the church."  FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT: REFLECT, REPENT  Given today's "polarized" and "fractured" world — and pointing to the war in Ukraine as tangible evidence of that — Fr. Austin said we need "the ministry of reconciliation" to spread throughout the world.  There are four sets of Ember Days each year, which roughly follow the seasons.  The Lenten Ember Days always fall the week after Ash Wednesday and the first Sunday of Lent.  ASH WEDNESDAY, START OF LENT: WE MUST ‘TURN TO GOD’  "When I became an Episcopalian and first learned of these days, I thought they had some obscure connection to fire," said Austin.  "Not so," he continued. "In Massey Shepherd's old commentary on the American Prayer Book, ‘ember’ is a shortening from the German ‘Quatember,’ itself from Latin ‘Quattuor Tempora,’ which means ‘four seasons.’"  Speaking further on the ancient beginnings of Ember Days, Fr. Austin said the choice of Wednesday, Friday and Saturday comes from church practices in the early centuries A.D.  Back then, both Wednesday and Friday were set as days of fasting — and in Rome, Saturday was also a fast day in preparation for Sunday.  LENT: WHAT IS IT AND WHY DO WE OBSERVE IT?  The focus of Ember Days used to be exclusively on ordained ministry — bishops, priests and deacons, said Austin.  In recent decades, the emphasis has broadened, he said. In the Episcopal Church today, for example, there are three prayers — each of the Ember Days has a slightly different focus.  First: A prayer for the ordained, that God would "fill them with the truth of thy doctrine" and "clothe them with holiness of life," said Fr. Austin.  This is a prayer that the ordained continue in faithful service throughout their life, something that cannot be done without God's special help, "which is what we mean by grace," he said.  "Ember Days [highlight] the fact that the church itself has a vocation, and that is to be an instrument of God for the spread of his kingdom," said Fr. Austin of Dallas, Texas.  Second: A prayer that fit persons are chosen for the ordained ministry; in other words, this is a prayer for discernment. This prayer turns our attention to the "processes in the church" by which discernment is made of whom to ordain, said Austin. "Priests are not lone rangers; they live and work as part of the whole church," he noted.  Third: We pray for all Christians during Ember Days. All Christians have a ministry, ordained or not, said Fr. Austin.  The prayer is offered "for all members of thy holy Church," that they would serve God in truth and godliness "in their vocation and ministry."  "Ember Days [highlight] the fact that the church itself has a vocation, and that is to be an instrument of God for the spread of his kingdom," Austin said, noting that every Christian person has some part to play in that "very big calling."

Former Haas F1 driver Nikita Mazepin and his father, Dmitry Mazepin, have been added to the list of individuals sanctioned by the European Union, which includes travel restrictions and asset freezes, according to Financial Times.  Dmitry Mazepin controls Russian fertilizer giant Uralchem, which had its sponsorship of the Haas F1 team terminated along with his son's driver contract last week.  "He is a natural person associated with a leading businessperson (his father) involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation [sp] of Ukraine," the Official Journal of the EU says regarding Nikita Mazepin.  American-owned Haas said last week that the situation had become untenable, even though a ruling by the FIA Motorsports governing body would've allowed Mazepin to drive this year under the organization's flag instead of Russia's.  Uralchem has asked the team to return all the sponsorship money that was paid to it for this season and has threatened legal action if it does not comply, WTF1.com reported.  Nikita Mazepin, 23, said the announcement of his dismissal came without any notice.  "I was not ready for it. I did not receive any hint, or any support to say ‘you know, this is the decision we’ve taken, it’s going to go live in 15 minutes, just be ready for it’," Mazepin said, according to WTF1.com.  He also said he has no intention of ever trying to go back to a team that doesn't want him but refrained from explicitly bad-mouthing Haas.  "If I get the chance to speak to the team – I want to note that it definitely won’t be me reaching out, because I feel that I haven’t done anything [bad] – then of course I will tell them directly what I personally think of this."

Vermont needs to reduce its moose population.  According to the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife, the moose population is struggling with a tick infestation. A reduction in the population may help slow the spread of the small animals that suck blood and spread disease.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  The state may issue 100 moose hunting permits for the upcoming fall season, the Associated Press reports. The Fish and Wildlife Board recently accepted the proposed hunt, moving it closer to becoming a reality.  Nick Fortin, moose project leader for the FWD, said, "Moose density in WMU E is still more than one moose per square mile, significantly higher than any other part of the state. Moose densities greater than one per square mile support high numbers of winter ticks which negatively impact moose health and survival."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  He continued, "Research has shown that lower moose densities in the rest of Vermont support relatively few winter ticks that do not impact moose populations. Reducing moose density decreases the number of available hosts which in turn decreases the number of winter ticks on the landscape."  Moose health in the state has deteriorated due to the spread of ticks, according to a recent study. While adult moose survival rates have remained high, less than half of the calves are surviving their first winter. Researchers believe that without the ticks, the majority of these calves would have survived.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  The tick situation is also seemingly causing a reduction in birth rates.  Moose make good targets for winter ticks because they don't have the same grooming habits of other potential prey. This means that ticks can attach themselves to the moose and live it a longer life cycle, causing the host moose to get much sicker.

Bear hunting is returning to some areas of North Carolina.  The state's Wildlife Resources Commission voted to allow bear hunting in three areas of the state where bear sanctuaries are located. According to the new rules, hunters will need a permit and the season will be heavily regulated.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  The new rules will go into effect on Aug. 1, WLOS reports. The areas where bear hunting will be allowed are the Panthertown-Bonas Defeat, Standing Indian and Pisgah bear sanctuaries.  The decision to allow hunting was made in response to the state's Black Bear Management plant, which was created in response to the growing population of bears in the state.  While the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission voted to approve the limited hunts, it also recently reminded hunters to be careful around bear dens.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  In a news release on the commission's website, the agency warned hunters to avoid dens. If they find one, they should not disturb it and leave the area as quickly as possible. If not, they may cause the mother bear to permanently abandon the den and the cubs within it.  The release was prompted by the recent discovery of a young cub that had seemingly been abandoned.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We received a call from the public about a cub found by itself and quickly investigated the situation," stated Colleen Olfenbuttel, the black bear and forbearer biologist with the Wildlife Commission. "The den was likely disturbed, and we safely delivered the 4- to 5-week-old male cub to one of our two licensed rehabilitators specialized to care for orphaned cubs. Thanks to the correct response by the caller, we were able to investigate, confirm the cub was orphaned and get the cub the care it needed within hours of the initial call, better assuring the cub’s eventual release back into the wild."

There are a lot of different ways to protest.  A diner in Quebec decided to show support for Ukraine in a truly unique way. While it hasn't changed the items offered on its menu, it has decided to change the name of a popular Canadian dish.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  Poutine is a popular Canadian dish that includes French fries, cheese curds and gravy. Also, the word "poutine" sounds like the name "Putin" when said out loud.  This connection prompted the apparent inventor of the dish to take action.  Le Roy Jucep, located in Drummondville, Quebec, decided to show solidarity with Ukraine by taking the word "poutine" out of its trademark. The diner claims to have invented the dish and is considered a somewhat famous restaurant among Canadians.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  The diner posted its decision to Facebook last Friday, but it has since removed the post due to receiving hateful replies and phone calls, Montreal CTV News reports. The business' Facebook page still lists it as the inventor of "poutine," although the name has been changed to say "The Inventor of Fries, Cheese and Gravy."  When the story made headlines, however, the restaurant posted a follow-up, saying, "Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that's already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Poutine first started being served in the 1950s. It's a popular dish in Canada and some northern U.S. states, although there are some regional variations.  For example, in New Jersey, a similar dish is served which is known as Disco Fries. It's essentially the same thing, except it uses melted cheese instead of cheese curds.

Pipko, 26, who has long been outspoken about her patriotism, says the Russia-Ukraine crisis is a reminder that the people of the United States are "rooting and praying" for Ukrainians.  "We know that they don't deserve what is happening to them and hope, and pray, that they can be courageous, but also remain safe during this time," Pipko told Fox News Digital in an interview.  The founder of The Exodus Movement and author shared her personal connection to the conflict overseas.

My family members come from all over the region, Russia, Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine. Much of what makes me who I am came from that region of the world," Pipko shared.  Despite living thousands of miles away from the crisis, the New York native reminded us why all Americans should remain vigilant amid this devastating moment in history.  ‘It’s that simple'  "I have heard people ask, ‘Why we should care about what is going on in Russia and Ukraine today?’ We as Americans know what we stand for, and we know that an attack on democracy anywhere is an attack on democracy everywhere.

"One can only hope that they have learned their lesson after what we saw in Afghanistan and take proper action this time.  "The United States was challenged in a similar way during the Cuban missile crisis.

CELEBRITIES REACT TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT: 'MY HEART HURTS'  Silence is not the answer  The crisis has prompted several celebrities, especially those with Ukrainian and Russian heritage, to speak out and call for an end. Many have shared the disbelief that war is occurring in 2022. Pipko declared this is another moment in history where silence is not the answer.  "I am always of the mindset of speaking up for what you believe in. At the least, that is what the Ukrainian people should expect from all of us today," she said.

The Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant winner this year is a St. George local, and she was not the only Utahn to shine at this year’s competition in Las Vegas.  Marianne Hamilton has been involved in the Southern Utah community for more than 10 years, leaving her mark on several organizations, the Spectrum newspaper reported. Since moving here from Northern California in 2014, Marianne and her husband Doug have become heavily involved in the Huntsman World Senior Games. Marianne discovered her love of athletics through participating and being a race director over the years.  It was her involvement with the Huntsman World Senior Games that led to her competing in the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant in 2019.  MISS AMERICA PAGEANT TURNS 100 YEARS OLD  "We were at nationals and this woman was greeting the athletes, and she was wearing a gown and her sash said Ms. Senior Utah, and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting.’ So I talked to her just real briefly," Hamilton said. "And then I ran into her again ... at another Senior Games event here. And we talked more, and she explained to me about senior pageantry and how it empowers women over 60 to still be out there and still give back to their community."  After looking into the website and speaking with the pageant director, Hamilton decided to compete in 2019.  Hamilton was diagnosed with breast cancer during her time between the 2019 and 2020 pageants.  It was an experience unlike anything she had previously had, but Hamilton said there were similarities between the senior athletic competitions and the senior pageantry. Both competitions focus on accomplishments in older people.  WOMAN DROPS 112 POUNDS, WINS BEAUTY PAGEANT AFTER FIANCÉ DUMPED HER FOR BEING TOO FAT  "I see very, very similar parallels between the Senior Games and being in the Senior Universe Pageant. And I think both are about a refusal to accept that age dictates boundaries," Hamilton said.  The Ms. Senior Universe Pageant focuses on competitors’ ability to show their accomplishments and how they portray themselves. There is no bathing suit competition. Instead, there are several days of questions and other ways for competitors to distinguish themselves.  One thing Hamilton excelled at was the writing portion of the competition. She is a journalist for St. George Health & Wellness Magazine and the St. George City Lifestyle Magazine.  "There was a lot of writing involved, which was kind of to my strengths, which was nice," Hamilton said. "You have to write several times; I had to write introductions for the judges to read. And you need to write out your philosophy of life and be able to recite that from memory within 30 seconds. There are a lot of photographs to gather and a lot of reflections about your life."  CHIHUAHUA BEAUTY PAGEANT GETS MORE THAN 800 COSTUMED PARTICIPANTS: SEE THE PHOTOS  With Hamilton turning 70 this year, the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant was a way to start the year with a big bang. She said she planned to perform her duties as Ms. Senior Universe USA while continuing to write and race.  "It’s really thinking about the fact that whatever age you are, you deserve to be celebrated," Hamilton said. "And the more years you have on Earth, the more cumulative experience as you bring to the party."  Hamilton said that when she started she wasn’t expecting to get breast cancer in between competitions, but she learned from the experience.  "I’m here to tell you that it’s not a death sentence," she said. "And those kinds of things all go into making you a stronger person, and maybe able to help other people who are going through it."

The first person to receive a heart transplant from a pig has died, two months after the groundbreaking experiment, the Maryland hospital that performed the surgery announced Wednesday.  David Bennett, 57, died Tuesday at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Doctors didn’t give an exact cause of death, saying only that his condition had begun deteriorating several days earlier.  MAN GETS GENETICALLY ALTERED PIG'S HEAT TRANSPLANT IN FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND PROCEDURE  Bennett’s son praised the hospital for offering the last-ditch experiment, saying the family hoped it would help further efforts to end the organ shortage.  "We are grateful for every innovative moment, every crazy dream, every sleepless night that went into this historic effort," David Bennett Jr. said in a statement released by the University of Maryland School of Medicine. "We hope this story can be the beginning of hope and not the end."  Doctors for decades have sought to one day use animal organs for life-saving transplants. Bennett, a handyman from Hagerstown, Maryland, was a candidate for this newest attempt only because he otherwise faced certain death — ineligible for a human heart transplant, bedridden and on life support, and out of other options.  After the Jan. 7 operation, Bennett’s son told The Associated Press his father knew there was no guarantee it would work.  Prior attempts at such transplants -- or xenotransplantation -- have failed largely because patients’ bodies rapidly rejected the animal organ. This time, the Maryland surgeons used a heart from a gene-edited pig: Scientists had modified the animal to remove pig genes that trigger the hyper-fast rejection and add human genes to help the body accept the organ.  At first the pig heart was functioning, and the Maryland hospital issued periodic updates that Bennett seemed to be slowly recovering. Last month, the hospital released video of him watching the Super Bowl from his hospital bed while working with his physical therapist.  Bennett survived significantly longer with the gene-edited pig heart than one of the last milestones in xenotransplantation -- when Baby Fae, a dying California infant, lived 21 days with a baboon’s heart in 1984.  "We are devastated by the loss of Mr. Bennett. He proved to be a brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end," Dr. Bartley Griffith, who performed the surgery at the Baltimore hospital, said in a statement.  PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANT SUCCESSFULLY TESTED ON DECEASED WOMAN  The need for another source of organs is huge. More than 41,000 transplants were performed in the U.S. last year, a record -- including about 3,800 heart transplants. But more than 106,000 people remain on the national waiting list, thousands die every year before getting an organ and thousands more never even get added to the list, considered too much of a long shot.  The Food and Drug Administration had allowed the dramatic Maryland experiment under "compassionate use" rules for emergency situations. Bennett’s doctors said he had heart failure and an irregular heartbeat, plus a history of not complying with medical instructions. He was deemed ineligible for a human heart transplant that requires strict use of immune-suppressing medicines, or the remaining alternative, an implanted heart pump.  Doctors didn’t reveal the exact cause of Bennett’s death. Rejection, infection and other complications are risks for transplant recipients.  But from Bennett’s experience, "we have gained invaluable insights learning that the genetically modified pig heart can function well within the human body while the immune system is adequately suppressed," said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the Maryland university’s animal-to-human transplant program.  One next question is whether scientists have learned enough from Bennett’s experience and some other recent experiments with gene-edited pig organs to persuade the FDA to allow a clinical trial — possibly with an organ such as a kidney that isn’t immediately fatal if it fails.  Twice last fall, surgeons at New York University got permission from the families of deceased individuals to temporarily attach a gene-edited pig kidney to blood vessels outside the body and watch them work before ending life support. And surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham went a step further, transplanting a pair of gene-edited pig kidneys into a brain-dead man in a step-by-step rehearsal for an operation they hope to try in living patients possibly later this year.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Pigs have long been used in human medicine, including pig skin grafts and implantation of pig heart valves. But transplanting entire organs is much more complex than using highly processed tissue. The gene-edited pigs used in these experiments were provided by Revivicor, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics, one of several biotech companies in the running to develop suitable pig organs for potential human transplant.

Louisiana's lawmakers are pressing Congress to send more federal disaster aid through the spending bill that keeps the government operating and provides emergency funding.  Powerful Hurricane Laura hit the area in August 2020. Six weeks later, Hurricane Delta made landfall. In the past 18 months, Lake Charles also survived an ice storm and tornadoes.  LAKE CHARLES MAN'S HOME DAMAGED BY HURRICANES, NOW HAS TO CLEANUP FROM A TORNADO  "These storms were unprecedented; the amount of destruction has been catastrophic," said Alberto Galan of the Calcasieu Parish Emergency Management. "It’s really hard to believe we’re this far out, even with the work we have done in the past, it’s hard to fathom."  A Louisiana Congressman asked for an additional $3 billion on top of the $600 million previously approved for disaster relief. But, the pricey amendment did not make the $1.5 trillion bill. The city’s hope lies with the House of Representatives that can still add to the bill and votes Friday. The government could shut down if the bill is not passed.  Dollars are spread thin with ongoing pandemic financial recovery and aid to Ukraine. COVID-19 funding was even taken out of the bill. Galan worries that repairing hurricane-ravaged Calcasieu Parish will fall further down the spending priority list as more time goes by.  Slow Recovery  Disaster response, repairs and outside help have been sparse over the past 18 months due to the pandemic.  "COVID made it extremely difficult. We did not have a lot of boots on the ground when it comes to adjusters and insurance folks coming in, as well as FEMA folks," said Galan about recovery efforts during the height of the pandemic. "When you’re not seeing it here in person, it makes it a little bit of an easier pill to swallow than when you’re here on the ground experiencing some of the things the folks here are experiencing."  The area has recently seen more volunteers arriving with pandemic fears easing.  "From the 1st of January to now, we have done 27 jobs and we have 42 signed up," said Gid Yoder with the Mennonite Disaster Service. "There’s just a lot of people that still need help and hopefully we made a little dent in it."  He and a group of Amish and Mennonites from Ohio have been helping out with community repairs.  Strongest hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana  Hurricane Laura, a Category 4 hurricane, was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Southwest Louisiana since records began in 1851. It maintained category 3 and 4 status with 111-150 mph winds as it passed over the parish. The wind and storm surge damaged buildings, power infrastructure and trees.  HOW ARE HURRICANES RATED?  Hurricane Delta made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane just 12 miles east of the point Laura made landfall. Debris from Laura and the 8-12 inches of rain that fell from the Delta created widespread, significant flooding.  Four named storms made landfall in Louisiana in 2020. That tied the record number of tropical storms to hit Louisiana in a season.  If the bill does not pass on Friday, lawmakers are working on a short-term spending bill to keep the government open until March 15. That would allow debate to continue, keeping Lake Charles’ hope for more support alive.  FOX Weather will keep you updated on the results.  HERE'S HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER.

The world is showing its support for Ukraine with the country’s national anthem as the Russia-Ukraine war reaches its first week.  Countless videos of people singing or playing the anthem’s tune with live instruments have been shared on social media as citizens of the world display defiance toward Russian aggression.  Peaceful protestors have sung the anthem at rallies and demonstrations in cities across the globe as have Ukrainians who’ve taken to the streets to fight or have found shelter while Russian Armed Forces continue their attacks.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The anthem has also been played at sporting events, concerts and other gatherings around the world, including a hockey game between the Glasgow Clan and Fife Flyers in Scotland, a Dmitri Shostakovich concert at Bozar Brussels – Centre for Fine Arts in Belgium and Ukrainian opera singer Yuriy Yurchuk in London.  Ukraine’s national anthem — "Shche ne Vmerla Ukrainyina," which reportedly translates to "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet," according to National Anthems Info — is based on a poem written by ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi in 1862.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  The song’s lyrics were taken directly from Chubynskyi’s poem, and it was later composed into an anthem by Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a Catholic priest, according to the national anthem resource.  National Anthems Info reports that "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet" was performed for the first time in 1864 at the Ukraine Theatre in Lviv. The song was a popular tune among high society, but it was discouraged when the Soviet Union took over Ukraine in 1920 following the Russian Empire’s fall.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  The song regained popularity during World War II and became an unofficial anthem in Western Ukraine. It eventually became Ukraine’s national anthem a little over four decades later when the country achieved its independence.  Ukraine became an independent nation on Aug. 24, 1991. The anthem was formally adopted in January 1992 by legislative officials in Ukraine’s parliament.  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  National Anthems Info reports that slight modifications to the anthem’s lyrics were made in 2003.  Translated lyrics for "Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet" published by Lyrics on Demand — an online song lyric database — describe Ukrainian resilience in face of adversity, which is expressed in seven rhythmic lines.  "Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,  Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.  Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,  And we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.  We'll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom  And we'll prove that we brothers are of Kozak kin  (repeat previous two lines)"  — Ukraine national anthem: ‘Ukraine is Not Dead Yet’ English translation by Lyrics on Demand  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022.  The invasion was launched after weeks of tension mounted between the two countries following Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine’s borders.

Hours before Russia’s deadly air assault began, host Jessica Rosenthal spoke to Fox News strategic analyst General Jack Keane and Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Amy Kellogg about what events led up to the attack and what politically and culturally pressures could have driven President Vladimir Putin to make this world-shattering decision.  Retired four-star general Keane discussed President Putin past attempts to use violence to win control over the country of Ukraine and what his motivations could be.  Kellogg, who is currently in Moscow, discussed how the Russian people feel about their President’s desire to reestablish Russia’s power over Ukraine and his rationalizations to use military force.  Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire conversations with both General Kean and Amy Kellogg and get more perspective on the War in Ukraine.

However, there are signs diplomacy could still work. Fox News Senior Field Producer Yonat Friling joins the Rundown to discuss how Russian conflict with the U.S. may be less severe than many Americans fear. Friling also breaks down what’s happening in other parts of the globe, from the attempted ballistic missile attack in Abu Dhabi and more signs that the threat of ISIS is still very real.

Graham believes Ambassador Antonov is part of a war crimes regime and his boss, Putin, is an international criminal war criminal. Graham says Antonov “is the mouthpiece for Putin, has no moral standing, and I hope to see him in The Hague one day.” Graham feels the solution lies with the Russian people and the sooner they can stop the menace in Russia, it will make the world a better place. Graham added, “I hope there’s a Russian spring in the making here.”

Waltz also addressed reports that the KGB can track and target Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when he addressed his people through his mobile phone and the internet. Waltz says the KGB are some of the best in the world in their cyber tracking. Waltz fears every time Zelenskyy is broadcasting he is putting his life on the line and we will see the screen go black because of a Russian cruise missile coming through the window.

Brady believes President Biden’s decision earlier this year not to get Ukraine surface to air missiles is coming back to haunt Ukraine. Brady also discussed how President Biden at tonight’s State of the Union has to end all the emergency COVID programs that discourage Americans from coming back to work, drop the tax increases that drive up inflation and hurt workers. Brady also stressed the need to start prioritizing workers instead of spending half a trillion dollars on the Green New Deal subsidies.

I mean, I’ve been saying this for weeks now, even before the Ukraine thing happened. He realizes we have a huge supply shortage, but I don’t understand why his solution for making up the supply is Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia. Why is the solution not America and also Canada? Canada’s the third or fourth largest oil reserves in the world. Why are we not even making overtures to them to say, can we increase production? And of course, they would say, well, if we increase production, we’ve got to get it somehow from Canada to Houston. We were going to build the pipeline, but you canceled that on us. I mean, very little was said about how angry Canada was for canceling Keystone Pipeline, not just the American jobs, but the Canadian diplomacy. Right? So he knows we need the supply, but he just doesn’t want that supply to come from America.”  Daniel also weighs in on the push by many in the Democratic Party to eliminate fossil fuel emissions and move the country in the direction of green energy.  Plus, people across America check in to tell Jimmy what they’re currently paying for a gallon of gas. Callers also share their thoughts on electric vehicles, and whether they really are a viable transportation option for everyone.

President Biden has announced a ban on all imports of Russian gas, oil and energy into the U.S., and is warning the pain at the gas pump Americans are currently experiencing is only going to get worse. Mollie thinks his administration’s policies have always been modeled toward hurting the fossil fuel industry in an attempt to implement their clean energy agenda.  “I mean, they have been pretty open about how they want to destroy energy based in fossil fuels. That’s what they claim they want to do. That’s what their policies are oriented toward, what the entire Democrat Party’s policies are oriented toward. And so we should just take them at their word. But even the electric car silliness, apart from the ignorance of how expensive those are for most people, there’s also the issue of how they’re actually fueled in part by fossil fuels. Electricity isn’t something that has no relationship to fossil fuels, and the lack of understanding of that is infuriating. But just in general, these people are very bad at policy making. They’re very bad at decision making. They have done so much to bring us to the brink of actual nuclear war, which they apparently want us to get involved in. And it is just maddening to think of how little we can do to fight against it, and how much control they have over our society. And it’s terrifying right now.”  Later, North Carolina Republican Congressman Greg Murphy returns to the show and disputes Biden’s claim that his administration has not taken any action to hinder domestic energy production.

AAA reports the national average price for a regular gallon of gas in the U.S. reached $4.065 on Monday. According to Chris, the Biden administration’s response to the situation in Eastern Europe is only contributing to the pain at the pump many Americans are currently dealing with.  “We’re seeing the largest gas rise recorded in American history. It’s absolutely wild. And a lot of people are getting hurt. There’s awful violence going on in Ukraine. There’s awful violence that we’re seeing on our television cameras. But I’m not exactly sure I’m following the response of our governors, the response of our President, the response of the United Nations. It does not seem to be helping anyone.”  Plus, Fox News Contributor and media columnist for The Hill Joe Concha returns to the show and tells Jimmy why Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s call to produce more oil in the U.S. is directed at the Democratic Party. He also comments on the media’s coverage of what has been happening in Ukraine.  Listen to the podcast to hear what else Chris and Joe had to say!

Keane reacted to the Pentagon’s move to reject Poland’s offer to provide Jets to Ukraine saying,  “Yeah, I mean, I think I don’t know all the facts. No one does because, you know, we’re just not being told, but some just breaking through it a little bit. It was the poll’s idea. It was endorsed by Secretary Blinken two days ago after some discussion. I believe this happened. Likely a high government official from Russia called the foreign minister or the defense minister in Poland and told them, If you provide those fighter jets, we’re going to look at that as an act of war and you’ll suffer the consequences. I think that likely spooked them and they came up on an idea. Okay, we’ll still give the jets up, but we’ll give them to the Americans much more powerful country than we are, and they can deal with this better than we can and let them get the jets in the hands of the Ukraine. I don’t know that for a fact, but I’m speculating it seems very plausible to me.”

There are growing bipartisan calls in Congress to ban Russian oil imports in the U.S. as a way to cut off Vladimir Putin’s revenue stream. Dagen says the restrictions the Biden administration has placed on the U.S. energy sector over the past year have only hurt domestic oil and gas production and strengthened Putin.  “Well, that’s the problem is they’re invested in an ideology and not a reality of how people need and use cheap and plentiful fossil fuels. But also how, and I said this a year ago and it makes me insane, the day that Biden was inaugurated, I said by attacking our energy sector, which he did do by canceling Keystone XL, that was the beginning. I know that it hasn’t been finished yet. A lot of it wasn’t complete. I understand all of that. But it was representative of canceling leases, canceling drilling permits, trying to shut down the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and nominating people to positions of power who want to quote bankrupt the oil companies and starve them of funding. So that’s who they are. So on day one, I said, when you damage our energy economy, which raises our standard of living and also gives us power and prosperity on the world stage, you were handing power and wealth to nations that hate us, that want to wipe the United States off the map. You’re handing power and wealth to Vladimir Putin and to Iran. And I said it a year ago, and that’s exactly what happened.”  Plus, Co-Anchor of “America’s Newsroom” Bill Hemmer stops by to discuss the latest developments in Eastern Europe. Diana also calls in to tell Jimmy how she and her mother escaped two cities in Ukraine that have been invaded by Russian troops.
