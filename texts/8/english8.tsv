Credit... Aamir Qureshi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images  The Supreme Court on Monday heard a challenge to the political moves by Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan that kept him in power, including his call to dissolve Parliament, before adjourning for the day.  Mr. Khan and his allies on Sunday blocked a no-confidence vote that he appeared set to lose, an outcome that would have ousted him as prime minister. But the maneuver plunged Pakistan into a constitutional crisis and threw the nation’s leadership into question.  Many legal observers expected the Supreme Court to overrule Mr. Khan. But it could also agree to allow elections for a new assembly to go ahead, which would give Mr. Khan a window to rally support for his leadership. A timeline for the court’s ruling was not immediately clear, and analysts worried that a lengthy process could fuel uncertainty about the country’s political future.  Mr. Khan, 69, is a former cricket star who came to power on a nationalist platform and pledges to tackle corruption. His popularity has taken a hit in recent months as inflation has surged.  His relationship with Pakistan’s powerful military, which has ruled the country intermittently since its independence in 1947, soured after he refused to back the appointment of a new chief of the country’s intelligence agency last year.  Lawmakers began convening last week, and allies to his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party announced that they were dropping support. The opposition then mustered the simple majority of votes they needed to remove Mr. Khan from office.  But the vote Sunday was blocked by Mr. Khan’s allies in the National Assembly, who said that he planned to dissolve the body, a move he later confirmed in a televised speech. Mr. Khan repeated his assertion that the opposition was acting in concert with the United States government to oust him, accusing an American diplomat of issuing a threat to Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States. American officials have denied any involvement in the campaign to remove Mr. Khan.  The crisis revives the prospect of political instability in Pakistan, a nuclear power where no prime minister has served a full five-year term.

Credit... Aaron Ufumeli/EPA, via Shutterstock  Democratic and Republican senators are considering cutting as much as $5 billion in funding for the global vaccination effort from an emerging aid package — assistance that is central to President Biden’s strategy of reducing vaccine inequality and limiting the impact of the next coronavirus variant.  On Monday, the Senate will continue to trying to resolve a battle over a broader emergency coronavirus response package by slimming it to $10 billion from $15.6 billion. It was not clear whether the narrower bill would have the votes to move forward in either chamber of Congress.  While access to vaccines has gradually expanded around the world, administering the shots remains a challenge for a multitude of reasons. In many low-income countries, only about 15 percent of the population has received at least one vaccine dose, compared with about 80 percent of the population in many middle- and high-income countries, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.  Hence the need for urgent additional financial assistance, said Gayle Smith, a former State Department coordinator for global Covid response and health security. Cutting the aid, she said, could “signal that the United States kind of thinks the pandemic has been managed.” And while $5 billion is a significant sum, she said, it is far less than the “double-digit trillions this pandemic has cost the world.”  The issue is not only saving lives abroad. Uncontrolled outbreaks allow more dangerous virus variants to emerge, as occurred with Omicron, prolonging the pandemic and threatening yet more damage to the global economy. “Our goal has to be — not just the U.S. but every country in the world — has to be shutting this down as quickly as possible so that we, No. 1, minimize the risk of new variants,” Ms. Smith said.  The United States has led the way in the world’s pandemic response, Ms. Smith said, allotting the effort $11 billion as part of the American Rescue Plan passed last year. The country has also donated hundreds of millions of vaccine doses through the Covax global initiative and pledged many more.  The $4 billion the United States dedicated to Covax for the last fiscal year made up 36 percent of the initiative’s budget, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.  When asked at a White House press briefing on Thursday whether Mr. Biden would sign or veto a bill that did not include significant international aid, Kate Bedingfield, the communications director, said the president had been clear on the importance of funding efforts globally.  “Right now, countries in fact are declining our doses because they don’t have the infrastructure in place to take our lifesaving vaccines,” Ms. Bedingfield said. “Funding will obviously help solve this issue.”  The aid would also go toward other supplies, including protective gear and Covid treatments. Republicans have said they will support the aid, but have demanded that it be paid for by repurposing money already approved by Congress earlier in the pandemic.  Public health experts worry that wealthier nations are leaving other countries behind as they turn to third and fourth vaccine doses. The World Health Organization has been pushing for wealthier nations to share access to vaccines and therapeutics with the world’s more vulnerable populations.  “We can end the acute phase of #COVID19 this year but only if we work together to close inequities in access to vaccines and other lifesaving tools,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director general, said in a video he posted to Twitter on Tuesday.  Devi Sridhar, a professor and head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh, described the cut to the proposed package as a “major step backward.”  “I am worried that as we declare the end of the pandemic in Britain and the United States, we forget that it’s still causing a lot of devastation in other places, even if we’re not reading about it in the headlines,” Professor Sridhar said.  The uncertainty over Covid funding comes as the vaccination campaign has stalled in the United States, where total cases have now surpassed 80 million, according to a New York Times database. Daily inoculation rates have fallen to their lowest levels since vaccines became widely available to the public in early 2021.  About 32,730 people received their first shot this week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Booster shots are also waning, with only about 52,000 people getting their booster this week, compared with about a million people per week in early December, shortly after Omicron was detected in the United States.

With more than 60 percent of the votes counted in Hungary, preliminary results indicated that Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister since 2010, and already Europe’s longest serving leader, had won a fourth consecutive term despite accusations by the opposition that he has enabled Russia’s military onslaught by cozying up for years to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.  “We won a victory so big that you can perhaps see it from the moon, and certainly from Brussels,” Mr. Orban told a jubilant crowd of supporters late Sunday, taking a dig at the European Union, which he has long accused of pushing L.G.B.T.Q. and migrant rights in defiance of the democratic will of Hungarian voters.  The preliminary results dashed the hopes of Mr. Orban’s political foes that an unusually united opposition camp could break his ruling Fidesz party’s increasingly authoritarian grip on the Central European nation next to Ukraine.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking early Sunday in his capital, Kyiv, described Mr. Orban as “virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr. Putin.”  Asked about Mr. Zelensky’s assessment after casting his vote in Budapest on Sunday morning, Mr. Orban said curtly: “Mr. Zelensky is not voting today. Thank you. Are there any other questions?”  Image Voting Sunday in Hungary’s elections at a school in Budapest, the capital. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times  President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, also Moscow-friendly, has governed Serbia since 2012, and was expected to win re-election after rallying his nationalist and pro-Russian base by refusing to join the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russia. Serbia hopes to become a member of the European bloc, but its application has stalled.  An unusually high turnout in Serbia of nearly 60 percent forced officials to keep polling stations open late into the evening in some areas. Amid complaints of foul play by the opposition, the central election commission in Belgrade, the capital, said it would not issue results until Monday morning.  But exit polls indicated that Mr. Vucic would win a new term as president and that his Serbian Progressive Party would retain its hold on Parliament, albeit with a reduced majority. The opposition said it had won control of the municipal government in Belgrade.  Hungary and Serbia have very different histories. Mr. Orban governs a country that, until he came to power, viewed Russia with great distrust as a result of its past suffering at Russia’s hands, most notably when Moscow sent troops to brutally crush an anti-communist uprising in 1956. Mr. Vucic’s nation, however — Slavic and Orthodox Christian, like Russia — has long looked to Moscow as its ally and protector.  But under the two strongmen leaders, both countries have over the past decade drastically reduced the space for critical media voices, turning television stations with national reach into propaganda bullhorns and moving toward authoritarian rule. Each has cultivated close ties with Mr. Putin, who endorsed the Hungarian leader’s election campaign when he visited Moscow in February shortly before the invasion of Ukraine.  Image Mr. Orban’s supporters at the rally on Friday. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times  Serbia declined to impose sanctions on Russia while Hungary, a member of the European Union since 2004, agreed to an initial round of European sanctions but has strongly resisted extending them to include restrictions on energy imports from Russia.  In contrast to leaders in neighboring Poland, previously a close ally of Mr. Orban thanks to their shared hostility to liberal values, the Hungarian leader has also refused to let weapons destined for Ukraine pass though his country.  Before Hungary’s election, Mr. Orban hit back to counter opposition charges that his policy on Ukraine had betrayed not only foreign allies but also Hungary’s own painful memories of aggression by Russia. Mr. Orban mobilized the news media, most of which is controlled by the state and by friendly tycoons, to cast his opponents as warmongers bent on sending Hungarian troops to fight against Russia. The election offered a “choice between war and peace,” pro-government media warned.  The campaign seems to have worked, even among some older voters who remember the suffering caused by Moscow’s troops in 1956. “Why should Hungarian boys fight for Ukraine?” asked Janos Dioszegi, who was 13 at the time of the Hungarian uprising and whose father was imprisoned for 14 years by Soviet-backed authorities for his part in the anti-Moscow uprising. He said “of course” he chose Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party when he voted in Nagykovacsi, a small town near Budapest.  Echoing a line frequently aired in Fidesz-controlled media outlets, Mr. Dioszegi said there was no need to help Ukraine defend itself because it had provoked the war by becoming “a military base for America.”  Until Mr. Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, the centerpiece of Mr. Orban’s election campaign was an inflammatory referendum, timed for the day of the parliamentary election, on whether young children should be taught in school about gender transition surgery treatment, and exposed without restriction to sexually explicit material.  The war next door in Ukraine, however, derailed Mr. Orban’s effort to get voters to focus on transgender individuals and gays, forcing a reboot focused on painting his opponents as eager to take Hungary to war.  Image Demonstrations in Budapest on Saturday, where people gathered in solidarity with Ukraine. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times  When hundreds of pro-Ukrainian Hungarians and refugees from Ukraine gathered on Saturday in central Budapest to denounce the government’s fence-sitting on the war, the main state-controlled television station, M1, described the event as a “pro-war rally.” Anna Olishevska, a 24-year-old Ukrainian from Kyiv who took part, praised the ordinary Hungarians who she said had helped her after she fled across the border. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have crossed into Hungary over the past month, far fewer than the more than two million who have entered Poland but still a large number for a country where venomous hostility to foreign migrants had long been the cornerstone of Mr. Orban’s often xenophobic political platform.  While delighted by her reception in Hungary, Ms. Olishevska said the government had been so tentative in condemning Russia’s invasion and resistant to helping Ukraine defend itself, that she worries about staying in Hungary if Mr. Orban won another term.  “I can’t stay in a country where the government supports Russia,” she said, waving a hand-painted sign telling Mr. Putin where to stick his rockets.  Some prominent supporters of Mr. Orban’s party have even blamed Ukraine for the bloodshed in 1956, with Maria Schmidt, a historian and museum director, claiming falsely on Saturday that Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader who ordered troops into Hungary that year, was Ukrainian. He was Russian. Ms. Schmidt misrepresented the Soviet leader’s origins in response to a tweet by the British comedian John Cleese, who urged Hungarian voters to consider whether it was Russia or Ukraine that invaded Hungary in 1956.  Image Election Day in Budapest, the capital. Government control of the news media has fortified Mr. Orban’s position. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times  The blizzard of distortions and falsehoods in Hungarian news media outlets controlled by Fidesz has left opposition supporters in despair.  “They just repeat lies over and over, day after day,” Judit Barna, 81, a doctor, said outside a central Budapest polling station, where she had just voted for a united opposition ticket headed by Peter Marki Zay, a conservative small town mayor.  Referring to Mr. Orban’s early political career as an anti-Moscow firebrand who in 1989 demanded that Soviet troops leave, she asked: “How is it possible after 40 years of Soviet occupation and 30 years of democracy that the same guy who once shouted, ‘Russians, go home’ can now say that Russia is fighting a just war in Ukraine?”  Thanks to Fidesz’s stranglehold on the media, she added: “Half of Hungary’s population eats up all these lies. This is Hungary’s shame.”

If an occupant opened the door, she said, the fighters generally just searched for weapons and left. If nobody opened the door, she said, they would kick it in to search.  Others fared far worse. Vitaly Sinadin, a 45-year-old sculptor who was hobbling down a street on Sunday afternoon, said he had been tied to a metal pole for two days in a cinderblock house used by Russian forces as a base.  “They beat me, asking, ‘Where are the Ukrainian soldiers?’ and ‘Who in town is in the Territorial Defense Force?’” — a reference to the volunteer units that sprang up in the first days of the Russian invasion. A sprawling red-and-black bruise covering his thighs and back was consistent with his account of extensive beatings.  On Sunday afternoon, on a road leading west out of Bucha, a man lay dead on his back, his green bicycle toppled beside him. Shot through the face, he bore a large hole in the back of his skull.  Farther along that road — in a clearing in a pine forest on the edge of the village of Dmytrivka — the police had earlier in the day pulled the body of a Russian soldier, his face and uniform burned, from the turret of a blown-up tank. His documents showed he was 22, and from Buratyia in eastern Siberia.

But China has so far refused to condemn Mr. Putin for the war, which has killed thousands of civilians. Despite pressure from other world leaders to use its influence over Moscow to help end the crisis, Beijing has done little besides call for peace. And on Thursday Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, expressed his country’s commitment to strong ties with Moscow during talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in China.  The Biden administration has cast the war as a contest between democracy and authoritarianism. Chinese officials are mounting a counternarrative that American-led domineering is the source of conflict in Ukraine and elsewhere. They regard China and Russia as both menaced by “color revolution,” the party’s phrase for insurrections backed by Western governments. President Biden’s recent comments calling for Mr. Putin’s ousting are likely to reinforce Beijing’s view.  “They actually believe their own narrative about color revolutions and tend to see this whole situation as a U.S.-led color revolution to overthrow Putin,” said Christopher K. Johnson, the president of the China Strategies Group and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst of Chinese politics.  “Both domestically and internationally, Xi has been peddling this dark narrative since he took power,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview. “It allows him to justify his accumulation of power and the changes he’s made by creating this sense of struggle and danger.”  The documentary depicts the collapse of the Soviet Union as a lesson to Chinese officials not to be seduced by Western liberalism. China, the documentary says, must never follow the course taken by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last leader who had started glasnost, or openness, and engagement with the West.

As the invasion neared, Russia falsely claimed that it was responding to Ukrainian aggression and liberating citizens from fascists and neo-Nazis. And since the assault began, Russia made baseless claims that Ukrainians had indiscriminately bombed hospitals and killed civilians.  Instead, Ukraine’s online propaganda is largely focused on its heroes and martyrs, characters who help dramatize tales of Ukrainian fortitude and Russian aggression.  But the Ukrainian claims on social media have also raised thorny questions about how false and unproven content should be handled during war — when lives are at stake and a Western ally is fighting for its survival against a powerful invading force.  “Ukraine is involved in pretty classic propaganda,” said Laura Edelson, a computer scientist studying misinformation at New York University. “They are telling stories that support their narrative. Sometimes false information is making its way in there, too, and more of it is getting through because of the overall environment.”  Anecdotes detailing Ukrainian bravery or Russian brutality are crucial to the country’s war plan, according to experts, and they are part of established war doctrine that values winning not just individual skirmishes but also the hearts and minds of citizens and international observers.  That is especially important during this conflict, as Ukrainians try to keep morale high among the fighters and marshal global support for their cause.  “If Ukraine had no messages of the righteousness of its cause, the popularity of its cause, the valor of its heroes, the suffering of its populace, then it would lose,” said Peter W. Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. “Not just the information war, but it would lose the overall war.”

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.66 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.

It was avalanche season in the Salang Pass, a rugged cut of switchback roads that gash through the Hindu Kush mountains in northern Afghanistan like some man-made insult to nature, and he was determined to keep the essential trade route open during his first season as its caretaker.  The worry about traffic flow was both new and strange to the commander, Salahuddin Ayoubi, and his band of former insurgents. Over the last 20 years, the Taliban had mastered destroying Afghanistan’s roads and killing the people on them. Culverts, ditches, bridges, canal paths, dirt trails and highways: None were safe from the Taliban’s array of homemade explosives.  But that all ended half a year ago. After overthrowing the Western-backed government in August, the Taliban are now trying to save what’s left of the economic arteries they had spent so long tearing apart.  Nowhere is that more important than in the Salang Pass, where, at over two miles high, thousands of trucks lumber through the jagged mountains every day. It is the only viable land route to Kabul, the capital, from Afghanistan’s north and bordering countries like Uzbekistan. Everything bumps up its slopes and down its draws: Fuel, flour, coal, consumer goods, livestock, people.

In the book, Rose profiles Oswald Spengler, Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey, Alain de Benoist and Samuel Francis, five thinkers of the 20th century far right who are experiencing a revival in today’s — increasingly near — right. Some of them reach into our world directly. To take one example, Evola, a not-quite-fascist Italian theorist, has been cited by Steve Bannon and was translated into Russian by Aleksandr Dugin, the philosopher and mystic now sometimes known as “Putin’s Rasputin.”  The argument of the anti-liberals goes something like this: Our truest identities are rooted in the land in which we’re born and the kin among whom we’re raised. Our lives are given order and meaning because they are embedded in the larger structure and struggle of our people. Liberalism and, to some degree, Christianity have poisoned our cultural soil, setting us adrift in a world that prizes pleasure and derides tradition. Multiculturalism, in this telling, becomes a conservative ideal: We should celebrate the strength in cultural difference, reject the hollow universalist pieties of liberals and insist on the preservation of what sets people apart. The genius of this critique, as Rose writes, is that it recasts liberalism’s virtues into vices:  In theory, liberalism protects individuals from unjust authority, allowing them to pursue fulfilling lives apart from government coercion. In reality, it severs deep bonds of belonging, leaving isolated individuals exposed to, and dependent on, the power of the state. In theory, liberalism proposes a neutral vision of human nature, cleansed of historical residues and free of ideological distortions. In reality, it promotes a bourgeois view of life, placing a higher value on acquisition than virtue. In theory, liberalism makes politics more peaceful by focusing on the mundane rather than the metaphysical. In reality, it makes political life chaotic by splintering communities into rival factions and parties.  And yet the process runs in reverse, too. Both liberalism and Christianity become thrilling when described by their critics. Far from the technocratic slog of trade regulations and the deadening work of dragging laws past the filibuster, this liberalism is a marvel of imagination and ambition. It’s an ideology that believes human beings capable of new forms of social organization and a movement capable of untethering them from hierarchies so deeply embedded in our societies that they were thought to represent a natural, or even divine, order.  Christianity, too, gleams with a light it often lacks in today’s politics, and even in its pews: Here is a religion that insists on the dignity of all people and centers the poor and the marginalized. Rose’s subjects fear Christianity because they fear it cannot be tamed; even when the leaders they admire try to subvert it for their own purposes, it infects their societies with a latent egalitarianism, setting a trap that will inevitably be sprung.  Part of the book’s eerie relevance comes from the role Russia plays throughout. Spengler thought that the West was collapsing into incoherence and the next great cultural force might well emerge from a post-Bolshevik Russia. Yockey, one of the most egregious white supremacists in Rose’s menagerie, wrote in “anticipation of a resurgent Russia helping to correct a decadent West.” That is certainly the role Putin has claimed for himself, in speech after speech insisting on an identity rooted in soil and culture, on an imperialism justified by power and past, and on a conception of himself and Russia as lonely bulwarks fighting for traditional European culture.  When Putin gives a wartime statement standing with J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, against cancellation by those seeking rights and recognition for transgender people, this is the serious argument lurking in the inane juxtaposition: Putin is trying to rally those yearning for the certainties of the past and offended by the constant instability of the liberal present. The logic that says Ukraine belongs to Russia now because it belonged to Russia then is close cousin to the logic that defends the social hierarchies of today on the basis of their power in the past. (Rowling, it should be said, wants nothing to do with Putin.)

In this war, which I think of as World War Wired, virtually everyone on the planet can either observe the fighting at a granular level, participate in some way or be affected economically — no matter where they live.  While the battle on the ground that triggered World War Wired is ostensibly over who should control Ukraine, do not be fooled. This has quickly turned into “the big battle” between the two most dominant political systems in the world today: free-market, “rule-of-law democracy versus authoritarian kleptocracy,” the Swedish expert on the Russian economy Anders Aslund remarked to me.  Though this war is far from over, and Vladimir Putin may still find a way to prevail and come out stronger, if he doesn’t, it could be a watershed in the conflict between democratic and undemocratic systems. It is worth recalling that World War II put an end to fascism, and that the Cold War put an end to orthodox communism, eventually even in China. So, what happens on the streets of Kyiv, Mariupol and the Donbas region could influence political systems far beyond Ukraine and far into the future.  Indeed, other autocratic leaders, like China’s, are watching Russia carefully. They see its economy being weakened by Western sanctions, thousands of its young technologists fleeing to escape a government denying them access to the internet and credible news and its inept army seemingly unable to gather, share and funnel accurate information to the top. Those leaders have to be asking themselves: “Holy cow — am I that vulnerable? Am I presiding over a similar house of cards?”

But the bill was declared “dead” by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, this year, who refused to support it. Now Democratic leaders are hoping to negotiate a slimmed down version of the bill, but it’s unclear whether a bill will materialize with the provision in it.  It is a perilous time to throw low- and middle-income Americans off the insurance cliff: A new Omicron subvariant is spreading, and a program that provided coronavirus testing and Covid treatment at no cost to the uninsured expired in March because the government ran out of funds to support it. Another program that provided vaccination at no cost to patients is set to end this month.  The public health emergency phase of the pandemic may well be winding down. Deaths currently average about 700 a day and are dropping. Schools and offices are reopening, some without masking. But about one-third of Americans are still not vaccinated. And going forward, will newly uninsured low- and middle-income Americans be inclined to pay out of pocket to get a shot? If they get Covid, how will they afford the pills to treat it, when the government bought Pfizer’s Paxlovid treatment for $530 a course and consumers could pay even more on the free market?  Patients vulnerable to losing their health insurance may not be prepared for the change. There’s been little mainstream outreach about the coming changes, and many people may not read government advisories or understand the ins and outs of pandemic health policy.  If people lose Medicaid this year, they will have a chance to enroll in an A.C.A. health plan; the current enhanced subsidies mean they would be likely to pay little or nothing in the way of premiums until the end of the year. At which that point insurance could become unaffordable and they would fall of the insurance cliff again.  Preserving insurance gains for low- and middle-income people is an important opportunity that grew out of our two-year-long national calamity. It shouldn’t be squandered. After all, Covid-19 is just one of many diseases that unduly affect poorer people without insurance. Kaiser Family Foundation polling in March found that Americans are more worried about “unexpected medical bills” than about being able to afford food.  The government has promised to provide 60 days’ notice before the public health emergency period ends for good, when states will have to trim their Medicaid rolls. The enhanced A.C.A. subsidies don’t end until Dec. 31. There’s still time to find funding and act. As the risk of contracting a serious case of Covid-19 recedes, the risk of being uninsured shouldn’t grow.

[MUSIC PLAYING]  kara swisher  I’m Kara Swisher, and you’re listening to “Sway.” My guest today is Michael Lewis. He’s written 16 books. And a few of them, like “The Big Short,” have been made into Oscar-worthy films. Lewis likes to think about the big systems that govern our lives, like markets and the federal government. He has a knack for finding characters who show us how these systems work and how they fail us. His most recent book, “The Premonition,” examines America’s bungled response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Spoiler alert — it’s not that we weren’t prepared. It’s that we didn’t listen to the right experts. Lewis is on a bit of an expert kick lately. His podcast, “Against the Rules,” is out with a new season about the changing role of experts in American life. It’s been a while since he and I have spoken, and I’ve known him for a very long time. And while I was very curious to hear what he’s been up to with his work, there was something much more important to connect on. Lewis’s 19-year-old daughter Dixie was killed in a car accident last spring, so we started there. I don’t think we’ve talked in a long, long time, Michael.  michael lewis  We’ve not talked in a long, long time.  kara swisher  I’m so sorry about your daughter.  michael lewis  It’s been, it’s been the most extraordinarily awful experience.  kara swisher  I can’t imagine.  michael lewis  But, um, she was great. And she was so brave and so full of life. It’s very hard not to insist on yourself being brave and full of life in her honor. It’s very hard to curl up in a little ball and just be miserable because it’s so out of sync with her spirit. And the other two kids, Walker and Quinn, have been —  kara swisher  How old are they?  michael lewis  Junior in college and a freshman in high school, and Dixie was in the middle.  kara swisher  My son, Louie’s, age.  michael lewis  Is that right?  kara swisher  I think so.  michael lewis  Yeah.  kara swisher  Yeah.  michael lewis  Yeah. You know, life deals you things. I never expected to be dealt this. But I’ve been dealt this, and this is the hand I got to play now. And we’re kind of just figuring out how to play it.  kara swisher  Yeah. There’s nothing — you know.  michael lewis  There’s nothing good to say, and there’s no answer.  kara swisher  And that’s exactly right. My grandmother, I don’t think, ever recover when my dad died when he was 34. You know, it stayed with her for every day of her life. Me, too, different way.  michael lewis  Right. One of the things that’s been really striking to me is how particular it is that you actually aren’t joining a club of people who’ve lost children. It’s so different from situation to situation, depending on the relationship you had with the child, how the child died, your relationship to your own emotions. And I watched parents of other children who’ve died find outlets in anger towards something that happened and try to slake the emotion, kind of soothe themselves by satisfying the anger. But you’re not actually addressing the sadness. And I’m so relieved. I’m so relieved that there’s nobody I’m angry at. I don’t blame anybody. I really don’t. I think it’s possible as a parent to look back on your life and say, I didn’t leave it all on the field, you know, that I wished I’d done this or that. And I really left it all on the field. So I’m just dealing with that very pure emotion. It’s just sadness and loss.  kara swisher  Loss and missing, and missing.  michael lewis  And missing.  kara swisher  I think about my dad every day of my life, and that’s 50 years hence.  michael lewis  And how does he come up in your mind?  kara swisher  I just think about him all the time, every day.  michael lewis  Yeah, but what triggers it?  kara swisher  I just wondered what he would have thought.  michael lewis  Yeah. A hole was blown in your life, and the thing is what you do with that hole. And you can grow things in the hole.  kara swisher  Yeah, 100 percent.  michael lewis  And so you can try to build on the loss in ways that are positive, rather than give up. So and that’s all we’re trying to do. And in what I create and how I go through the day and how I respond to the inevitable feelings of just being crushed and not wanting to get out of bed is just like, OK, it’s a little harder. It’s a lot harder sometimes. But there’s something to build. And I’m still figuring out what it is particularly that I’m going to build just for Dixie. But just the act of like — I mean, it’s a horrible analogy, in some ways, but I think it’s the apt analogy — the rule of improv comedy, you know? You were given something and you —  kara swisher  So yes and.  michael lewis  You have to accept. — yes and. You have to accept it. She died. She was killed in a car crash. I can’t do anything about it. What do I do on top of that? And that’s kind of how we’re all proceeding. I’m really proud of the family. I mean, and she would have been the same way if one of the others of us had died, that it would have been hard and sad, but she would have found ways to fill the hole.  kara swisher  I’m so glad you have such a good attitude about it. You should write about your daughter. That’s the only thing I would say, is that’s how you can honor her. You’re such a beautiful writer, and I think a lot of people would find a lot of comfort because you articulate things so beautifully. Anyway, that would be my suggestion.  michael lewis  I think that’s right. I think I’ve got to get to a different place before I can.  kara swisher  Absolutely.  michael lewis  But anyway, so let’s talk about book and podcast.  kara swisher  OK, right, I know. I want to talk about your podcast, too. We both have podcasts. We have lots of podcasts. We’ve come so far. OK, let’s start first with the book, “The Premonition.” You wrote about America’s botched Covid response. You say, “Trump’s incompetence is only part of the story and maybe even not a big part.” And let me just sort of unpack that because a lot of people have their preconceived narratives about this, even as we’re in it. And I’m just curious, one, why you wanted to write about it right in the middle of it, and then, two, you’re sort of pushing against a narrative that a lot of people who might be fans of yours have, I think.  michael lewis  Yeah, no, it’s interesting. It’s a narrative that I thought I might have adopted myself, and I learned what I learned. So why I wrote about it is, one — “The Premonition,” it wasn’t ever really a pandemic book. I mean, the reason I wrote it when I wrote it is I knew my story ended in May of 2020. Once it was clear that we’d botched the response, once it was clear that we had 4 percent of the world’s population and 20 percent of the world’s deaths, even though we were meant to be better prepared and better armed and had more knowledge about this and more technology to deal with it, blah, blah, blah, the question was, why? What was it about our public health system? And I kind of teed it up already in my mind in a couple of ways. One was the book before “The Premonition” was called “The Fifth Risk,” and it was about the transition from Obama to Trump and this egregious example of neglect of our government in the Trump administration.  kara swisher  Explain what “The Fifth Risk” is for people who don’t know. It’s a wonderful book.  michael lewis  Sure, so by law and by norm, the outgoing administration is required to prepare to hand over the government to the incoming administration. And the Obama administration had deputed 1,000 people to spend six months to write briefing books about what was going on in the bowels of the Department of Agriculture. And this is not in commerce and the whole federal apparatus. And this is not an ideological matter. It’s sort of like, how we dealt with the Ebola outbreak or how you stop nuclear weapons from exploding when you don’t want them to explode. It’s sort of like what the government’s doing, what they might have learned, what mistakes they might have made, that kind of thing. And the conceit was I wandered around the government and got the briefings that the Trump administration didn’t bother to get, to try to get a sense of, what are these risks, who are these people? And the takeaway was the risks are terrifying, and the people are extraordinary. Whatever stereotype you have in your head of a federal worker, it’s probably wrong because they’re very mission driven, deep understanding of complex things, very bad at promoting themselves. They suck at telling their own stories. They’re the opposite of Trump. They’re not out there promoting themselves. And so we, as a society, have been neglecting them, and it’s at our peril.  kara swisher  Because we have a jalopy here run by people who are trying their best to hold it together —  michael lewis  That’s right.  kara swisher  — with chewing gum and baling wire.  michael lewis  And Trump is the ultimate expression of indifference towards the maintenance of the jalopy, but the jalopy has not been maintained for a very long time.  kara swisher  Right.  michael lewis  So it isn’t just Trump. It’s like the problems go way, way back. And what was in my head was, all right, something’s going to happen. I don’t know what it is. So something happens.  kara swisher  The pandemic.  michael lewis  The pandemic.  kara swisher  So it’s focused on the C.D.C., the Center for Disease Control.  michael lewis  Well, but if it had been something else, it would have been focused on something else.  kara swisher  Like the nuclear energy or whatever, which would have been —  michael lewis  Correct.  kara swisher  It can ruin your day, a nuclear bomb, but go ahead.  michael lewis  So I was already sitting there, thinking, I just want to keep following the story. And I rapidly accumulated people who were inside the public health system, one way or the other, who were incredible characters, who could describe to a reader why, if we had a pandemic, it was likely to go wrong. All of them had this sense of dread that something was going to happen.  kara swisher  The Cassandra’s. I mean, I watched “Contagion.” I mean, it’s that idea of people were worried that this was going to happen before this happened.  michael lewis  And they were just wringing their hands, worried. These were people who were in the middle of the public health system. They were actually — you know, I think you can’t write about our public health system without going right to a local public health officer. It’s where the rubber meets the road when there’s a disease outbreak around the corner from you.  kara swisher  So in this book was Charity Dean, the California public health official, forbidden from using the word pandemic in January 2020, and Carter Mescher, the co-author of George W. Bush administration’s U.S. pandemic plan. And obviously, there’s lots of other figures, but this is what you want to talk about, these people who had been talking about that this jalopy was going to fall apart if there was, say, a pandemic that was actually effective.  michael lewis  In part because they had kind of worked on the jalopy, right? They knew what was going on inside the thing. But they, as people, were so interesting to me that I was jazzed about it. I don’t think I’ve ever had all the pieces fall in place so fortunately for a book. This is odd to say about a book about the pandemic. I don’t think I’ve ever had a more joyous writing experience. It was totally a gas to write the book.  kara swisher  Because?  michael lewis  It’s a great question, because. Because the people lit up the page. They were so peculiar. I mean, let’s take Carter Mescher.  kara swisher  Explain who he is for people.  michael lewis  What he is at heart is a doctor, a doctor with A.D.H.D., who really has a hell of a time getting through school in a normal way because of that. But the minute he’s in a crisis, he’s engaged sufficiently that he’s at his very best. And he’s not just a doctor who’s good with patients in a crisis, but a thinker who’s really good with systems in a crisis. And then when the Bush administration says, oh, my God, we don’t have a pandemic plan, they find him. And he, together with another doctor named Richard Hatchett, are asking a question. And the question is what you do between the time of the disease outbreak and the time you have a vaccine. What do you do to minimize death? And the conventional wisdom was, there’s not much you could do. The takeaway from the 1918 pandemic had been social interventions, social distancing, closing schools, all that stuff doesn’t work. Carter Mescher, doctor, goes back into the history of 1918 with Richard Hatchett and re-examines case by case cities across America and finds that you know, actually, it wasn’t all the same. The death rate in Philadelphia was multiples of what the death rate in St. Louis was. Why? They find that actually, if you intervened early and distanced people, it had huge effects on mortality rates. And they end up writing academic papers, turning the conventional wisdom on its head. And Carter Mescher spends two years proselytizing this idea. And the whole reason the C.D.C. has a plan is him, him and Richard Hatchett. And that plan spreads around the world. The irony was that Carter would say is that other societies used the plan we created, and we didn’t. And he is, in the very beginning of the pandemic, just one step away from actually running the U.S. response. And he and Richard Hatchett, one really good example of our inability to locate the experts we need when we need them.  kara swisher  Which you said. You said one of the problems is the wrong people have the status. What did you mean by that? Because Tony Fauci does have status and influence. So aren’t there examples of people who deserve status and do have it, or is that not the case?  michael lewis  Of course, there are people who have status and deserve it. What I meant was at any given moment, especially when there’s a kind of an upheaval like a pandemic, the person with the ability to deal with the problem is quite likely not going to be obvious at first. Very broadly, the status of local public health officers was extremely low. They had no social power. I mean, this is one of the reasons that one of the characters says Trump was just a co-morbidity, was that you go back into the history of the C.D.C., and you see changes that we made in our government that started to neuter the authority of the person who ran the C.D.C. During the Reagan administration, the job of the C.D.C. director was changed from being a career civil servant to being a presidential appointee. Tony Fauci is a career civil servant. There’s a reason he was able to lock horns with Trump and not get fired, first, as the head of the C.D.C. who used to have that kind of distance from the political process, but from the Reagan administration on, did not. This is, I think, a big source of the problem of management in the government and the problem of social authority in the government, is that over a 40 or 50-year period, lots of jobs that used to be career civil service jobs became presidential appointee jobs. When that happens, what happens? The person who’s in the job is, one, picked from the pool of people who, you know, are probably from the political party of the president, rather than from the pool of people who are just qualified for the job. Two, can be fired with a phone call, so were looking over their shoulder at the White House all the time and can’t act independently. But three, the average presidential appointee for these top jobs in these government agencies, 18 months. They’re in there 18 months. They have an agency with tens of thousands of people that’s got an incredibly complicated brief. The staff knows that whoever’s coming in is only there for a short time. You’ve got at the top, you’ve got renters, not owners. You’ve got people who have no real hope of building a long-term career at the top of the agency. You’ve got no continuity. So, in any case, you have this instrument called the Centers for Disease Control that was meant to respond to this threat. And the instrument had slowly been allowed to degrade. And no one had really seen that it had degraded. So Charity Dean, the public health officer, main character of the book, has this lovely story that serves as a kind of metaphor for what happened at the C.D.C. And it’s from her time when she was a medical student at Tulane University. Recently divorced, living alone on the ground floor of an apartment that had these lovely roses in rose beds on her porch, and everybody thought of her as the lady with the green thumb. And she loved the reputation. And her roses start dying. And so she goes to Michael’s Arts and Craft and starts to buy plastic flowers to replace the real flowers. At first, it’s just one or two. By the time she’s done, the whole porch is plastic flowers, and nobody knows. From the distance, it’s all these beautiful flowers. And she starts to adjust her behavior. She won’t let people into her house because she’s afraid they’re going to see the plastic flowers. And finally, someone finds out and she’s mortified. But she said she watched the C.D.C. She felt she was watching a similar thing, that once upon a time, they had had an actual ability and the gumption to be kind of battlefield command in a disease outbreak. But over time, they have lost the ability, but were kind of covering up. And she knew because in her outbreaks she was managing as a local public health officer, she had to ban C.D.C. officers from getting involved because all they did was politicize it and make the response less effective. And she had colleagues who were in the same job across the state of California who said the same thing, that they aren’t helpful in an actual battle. If you start to just listen to the war stories of local public health officers, you would have had a sense even before Trump, that if we had a real crisis, it was going to be a problem.  kara swisher  So action versus caution is what you were talking about, that the C.D.C. was governed by caution, and let’s not act, so that’s why it was rotting from the inside from your perspective.  michael lewis  Well, it was cautious because it was rotting from the inside. The effect of insisting on waiting until you have absolute proof of what’s happened is, you are completely incapable of responding to a pandemic. Because by the time you know for sure, it’s too late.  kara swisher  But how do you, then, manage a pandemic at all if that’s the case, if you have sort of an inert government agency, which is, I think, you’re talking about, and crisis all over the country? On top of it, there’s political implications. Is it almost impossible to do so? Or do you just have to act, like you were saying?  michael lewis  So just so this doesn’t sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, at the beginning of the Trump administration, Tom Bossert, who was the Homeland Security director — I can’t remember his exact title — who had watched Carter Mescher and Richard Hatchett create the pandemic plan for the world, basically, for the country, had been so impressed by what he saw way back when, that he called them and said, if there is a pandemic, I want to have you here the next day, so can I badge you in now? Bossert gets fired when John Bolton is brought in, and everybody forgets about these experts. Carter Mescher was this sort of shadow response. He was sitting in his underwear in his bedroom in Atlanta, watching the pandemic in the very beginning and writing things about what was going on in China from early January. And he has a bead on what’s happening. There are things he wrote January 20 that was a plan of action and was just climbing his walls because for six weeks, the C.D.C. didn’t do anything, didn’t explain how urgent the situation was to the American public.  kara swisher  And this was because they were too political, or they’re too cautious?  michael lewis  Both. It’s like the Trump administration is gumming up their communication and their willingness. The Trump administration clearly has blood on their hands. But the institution itself had lost the ability to fight back. If you talk to the old timers at the C.D.C., former director Bill Foege, he writes this long letter to Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director, saying, you are squandering the moral authority of our institution. You are presiding over the destruction of the enterprise. You’ve got to stand up in spite of whatever the Trump administration, the White House is telling you to do, and take charge of this. I think that at the bottom of the failed response is a really bizarre attitude towards our own government. When you actually go talk to the people who know about pandemics, they aren’t in some kind of conspiracy against the people. They’re there because they love the country. They’ve devoted their lives to developing some expertise that they put in the service of their country for a lot less money that they’d make in the private sector because they believe in the mission. So there’s this huge disconnect between what the people think their government is and what it actually is and this striking inability to see that there’s a difference between government politics. People don’t make the distinction.  kara swisher  But this deep state idea is already baked in at this point, so it creates the perfect storm of disaster, in a lot of ways. They can’t fight back because people don’t trust them. Let me go through the premonition itself because you’ve gotten a lot of criticism for some of it. I think people are reading it as a sort of apology of Trump, for example. But I want you to address that. This is a lightning round, so we’re going to go fast. One of those that you’re making is these unheard of American experts out to be unique, when many people were calling for a rapid response to Covid-19, including the World Health Organization around the world. I’ve heard pandemic worries for a long, long time, and maybe I’m just hanging out with the wrong people.  michael lewis  No, I didn’t pick them because I said they were the only ones who said this is going to happen. In fact, none of them said, this is going to happen because you don’t know. I picked them for the same reason I picked the characters in the middle of “The Big Short,” just as there are lots of people who said that the financial crisis was going to happen, right? I picked them because they had skin in the game and because they could teach the reader about the public health system. I’m sure there are a dozen other people I could have picked, too. These people were just extraordinary characters and extraordinary teachers and were enmeshed with the system in all kinds of interesting ways. But maybe more importantly, I never thought when I’m writing the book that, oh, if only these people had been in charge, everything would have just gone really smoothly, although I do think we probably would have been much better off had they been in charge. I really thought I found these really interesting people who light up different aspects of the public health problem, who have incredible stories. All I’m going to do is tell their story. You decide what it means. I’m not saying that if only these three had been in charge or these were the only three who said that this was going to happen, nothing like that. I’m not muscling the reader around on this.  kara swisher  Speaking of muscle, some people think you don’t place enough blame at Donald Trump’s feet.  michael lewis  Trump has blood on his hands. It was awful what Trump did. He handled it horribly. The reason we can’t allow ourselves to think this was just Trump is that Trump is gone, and we still have the problems. It is a huge mistake to give — I don’t know — $8 billion to the C.D.C. right now and think, oh, that’s going to solve the problem. The structure of the institution is screwed up. Charity Dean was facing resistance in her attempts to manage disease outbreaks well before Donald Trump was elected president from the C.D.C. So you got to just take that into account when you’re thinking about what we do to fix the system. And the weakness of the system itself enabled the political creation of Donald Trump. I mean, Donald Trump doesn’t exist in the vacuum. Our society had gotten to the point where it was willing to put into the White House a man who did not know or care about the government he was meant to run. So can I say something else about this book that —  kara swisher  Please do.  michael lewis  — it’s been his misread as any book I’ve ever written. People wanted it to be one of two things.  kara swisher  Trump or the deep state.  michael lewis  Yes, exactly. I think all that’s nonsense. I think that’s a lot of people screaming at each other on cable news, and I’m not interested. I’m interested in how this thing works. [MUSIC PLAYING]  kara swisher  We’ll be back in a minute. If you liked this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with Patrick Radden Keefe, and you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Michael Lewis after the break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can I move to social media here? Of course, I would. How do you assess their role?  michael lewis  Social media? It cuts both ways, right? I mean, “Against the Rules,” the podcast that I do, this season is about experts. And I thought about doing one of the episodes about social media, but when you look at it, like, it’s not all bad. Look at the war on the Ukraine right now.  kara swisher  Right, it works here.  michael lewis  There’s great information on Twitter. I mean, I’m sure you got to parse it, but and there are people — Trent Telenko, who, he’s a Ukrainian tire guy. He’s an American former Army logistics guy. He’s looking at the tires of Russian vehicles and explaining why the convoy’s stuck. And that expertise would have a hard time surfacing itself in old media environment. It would take forever for Trent Telenko to find some journalist who would write about, oh, there’s this guy. And in addition, the pictures would never reach Trent Telenko’s desk, so he wouldn’t be able to see it. So, on the one hand, social media enables people who actually know stuff and who are basically buried in our society and invisible to express that knowledge. That’s a really good thing.  kara swisher  OK, but in the case of Covid, not so much.  michael lewis  In the case of Covid, it does allow people to choose their own story, to create different stories and so people can choose their own story. I mean, and it’s not just doctors that you across these professions, where the expertise is essentially probabilistic, where, yeah, you get the vaccine, and you’re much, much, much less likely to get seriously ill. But there will be cases of people who have the vaccine who get ill, and there would be a lot of cases the people who don’t get the vaccine who never even get Covid. So there are lots of stories out there where you can arrange another narrative that is really different from, basically, the truth.  kara swisher  And is that dangerous, though? You seem to be like, oh, well, that’s the way it is. That’s the oxygen we’re living in.  michael lewis  It’s obviously not good. The question is, what you do about it.  kara swisher  Did it have an impact on the C.D.C. in this case? Being pummeled all day, Redfield can’t have liked that, and Trump lived in that environment, in the Twitter environment, and used it as a battering ram against the C.D.C. or whoever he wanted to attack at the time. It was highly effective.  michael lewis  I think it’s hard to blame social media for the early inaction of the C.D.C. I think that was a separate thing. There’s a more general thing than just Covid going on here. It’s that people aren’t scientists. People have trouble with numbers. People have trouble with probabilistic thinking. They have trouble with authority. And when you’re dealing in these situations where there are true stories that contradict the expert advice, you’re going to get this kind of response. And I can’t think of another answer to it. The only answer to it is that you have respected authority at the top of, say, the C.D.C. that people listen to.  kara swisher  But Fauci has become a demon to the right. He’s a hero, probably too much of a hero to the left. It’s all online, and there are memes. He himself is involved in it.  michael lewis  No, no, I agree. You’re arguing with someone who doesn’t disagree with you.  kara swisher  OK.  michael lewis  It’s a mess. When you choose your news, you choose your sources of information, you don’t check against people who disagree, and you don’t really think like a scientist, you can end up in weird places. You know, it’s funny — I have friends, close friends, who are actually quite reasonable in their lives, who think the vaccine is a hoax. And when you ask them, how do you think that? Look at the data. Look at the scientific papers, all that. They have a story of a friend who got sick from the vaccine. And it really did happen. We’re identifying here is a kink in the human mind. And what happens on social media exploits that kink in the human mind.  kara swisher  So in that vein, you’ve done a podcast. Why are you doing a podcast? Is that in order to do that, to tell stories?  michael lewis  I think I did a podcast before you did yours.  kara swisher  No, I doubt it. I doubt it. I don’t think you did, Michael. I think I’m —  michael lewis  So, “Against the Rules,” this is our third season.  kara swisher  Eight years.  michael lewis  And — OK, you’re ahead of me, all right. But it’s a different kind of podcast. For me, it was taking essentially my magazine life and turning it into an audio magazine life. And the satisfaction I get in this is from a couple of places. One, the ear. It’s a different mechanism.  kara swisher  Yes, it is.  michael lewis  Much more emotional. You get to people in a different way than you get with the printed word. I do feel like that between the print works, it’s a really good muscle for me to exercise, to write for the ear. So I really like that. I think it has a good effect on my writing. It’s a workout. It’s cross training. The second is there are subjects that I can attack that I might not bother with, but I’m interested in. I can graze more freely with a podcast than I can with a long magazine piece. It just gets me out talking to lots of people I might not otherwise talk to. The third is the audience I get to. And you must notice this.  kara swisher  Yes, indeed.  michael lewis  Not everybody reads.  kara swisher  No.  michael lewis  And there are a whole crowd of people who listen to things who don’t read. And so it’s just a way of getting to those people.  kara swisher  Why do you pick experts? Because this book is about the failure of experts, but the correctness of some experts. Are experts dead in this tech environment, where everybody is an expert? Or how do you get back to people trusting experts? Because they don’t want to anymore.  michael lewis  If we’re going to describe it in this way, I would say “The Premonition” is about a decay in the relationship between the experts and the rest of the society. So it isn’t that the experts are getting worse. In fact, in many cases, experts are getting better, as the people perceive they’re worse, that you have very weird phenomena. Let’s take a really simple example, because we do it in the podcast — weatherman. Your weather forecast 40 years ago was primitive. And we talked to weathermen. I talked to old weathermen, and they’re very funny. They say, in the beginning of my career, I was instructed to stand up and utter with total certainty a forecast that was probably wrong and certainly not express it in probabilistic terms. And 40 years ago, like the 10-day forecast was no better than just guessing. The improvements in 40 years in weather forecasting are astonishing. The weatherman himself sounds less certain because he’s very aware of the probabilistic nature of his forecasts, but he knows a lot more. And you talk to them, they say, the amount of grief I get for bad weather forecasts now is so much higher than the grief I got 40 years ago. And it’s not just because of social media, though social media doesn’t help.  kara swisher  So you don’t think that it’s the tech impact on it, the amplification and weaponization of information?  michael lewis  That’s part of it. It’s certainly part of it. But part of it is a failure of the audience to appreciate probabilistic expertise. And so when the weatherman says there’s an 80 percent chance it’s going to be sunny tomorrow, 20 percent chance of rain, and it rains, people say he’s an idiot. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. They don’t think, well, two out of 10 times, it was going to rain. And that happens across disciplines.  kara swisher  At the same time, I think tech has gotten so powerful. They’re the richest people in the world. I think you should get back to writing about tech, Michael, by the way. We need you over here.  michael lewis  So can I ask you a question about that?  kara swisher  Sure.  michael lewis  All right, I give you go-like powers over my career. Where would you send me in the tech world to write my next book?  kara swisher  Crypto.  michael lewis  I’m there.  kara swisher  Because it’s what’s happening now, but worse in a way, and we’ve got to see it before it happens again because it has so much more power. It also meets your two areas of expertise — financial, which is your first book, “Liar’s Poker,” that got you so famous, and technology and experts. They want to get rid of experts, but they really don’t.  michael lewis  So I’m probably going to make your dream come true.  kara swisher  Oh, fantastic.  michael lewis  I’m interested — that’s actually — I am now marinating in the world of crypto. And I’m finding the story.  kara swisher  And beyond, Web 3, the decentralization of power and the decentralization of governments. And so my last question, I think, is, do you think the government, with all its flaws that you’ve laid out, has any chance of winning in a world where everyone’s an expert, everyone has control, and there’s a lack of trust of any kind of central authority?  michael lewis  So you really shouldn’t mistake me for a big thinker. I really am just a storyteller. But I do think the closer I got to the people who were actually in the government doing the mission critical stuff, the more hopeful I felt because it was so obvious. I felt like if people knew the truth, if the average American could be put in a room with this person they think of as the deep state, they would change their mind in about eight minutes. So what we have is not a truth problem, we have a communication problem. And that’s fixable. So I did find myself feeling extremely hopeful about where we might end up. It’s just like, I would have thought, an existential threat, like Covid, something that killed a million Americans. Would it have been enough to cause Americans to rally together and behave cohesively as a team? It wasn’t. There will be some other existential threat out there that will frighten people into seeing the way the world really is as opposed to the way I imagine it is.  kara swisher  I think Ukraine, I have to say.  michael lewis  I agree, it’s possible. It’s totally possible. But so I think it’s going to take some pain, and that when you get cornered and we actually have to function as a team, that we will, but that it’s going to be painful to be cornered.  kara swisher  Well, let’s end on that note, hopeful and painful at the same time. Michael, thank you so much. I appreciate this long and complex discussion.  michael lewis  Total pleasure. [MUSIC PLAYING]  kara swisher

His maximal goals have been abandoned (for now); his troops around Kyiv are in retreat; his imperial dreams are being disavowed. He has more modest goals to fall back on, resources and territories that he may be able to hold — but a month of Ukrainian valor and Western support has dealt his ambitions a devastating blow.  Putin is not losing, however, in the battle for Russia. From the start of hostilities, the Western answer to his maximalist ambitions — not an official goal, but a hope that informs policy and punditry and slips out of Joe Biden’s lips in excited moments — has been regime change in the Kremlin, a failed war toppling Putin and bringing a more reasonable government to power.  This was always a thin hope, but despite military quagmire and unprecedented economic sanctions, it appears even thinner now. In polling and anecdote alike, Putin appears to be consolidating support from the Russian public, rallying a nation that feels itself to be as he portrays it — unjustly surrounded and besieged.  His approval ratings, according to Russia’s main independent pollster, look like George W. Bush’s after 9/11. His inner circle has always been unlikely to break with him, for reasons sketched by Anatol Lieven in The Financial Times a few weeks ago: Its members mostly come from the same background, share the same geopolitical assumptions, and are far more likely “to fight on ruthlessly for a long time” than to suddenly turn against their leader. But even in the wider circle of Russian elites, the war so far has reportedly generated more anti-Western solidarity than division.

Entire cities — Mariupol, Izium and Volnovakha — are almost demolished. In Kharkiv, some of the most important architectural monuments of the Soviet era and the prerevolutionary period have suffered extensive damage. A number of UNESCO World Heritage sites and architectural treasures are under threat.  If, in the first days of the invasion, the Russians declared that they were targeting only military infrastructure, it quickly became clear that they were hitting buildings suffused with the memory and history of the people who lived in them: residential buildings, kindergartens, office centers, theaters. There are thousands of open wounds across the country. The worst thing is that you never know where the next Russian bomb will land.  After Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, many Ukrainians I know who were involved in protecting cultural heritage stepped up to defend the country as soldiers and volunteers because they had learned in peacetime how to protect what belonged to them — not just territory but also millions of small memories of walks home under a peaceful sky, good neighborliness and mutual support.  Before 2014, we rarely saw public displays of interest in cultural heritage in Ukraine. The Maidan revolution that year, in which mass protests led to the ouster of a pro-Russian president, kick-started the development of civil society based on Western values, like freedom of expression and self-determination. In defending these values, Ukrainians learned to be responsible for public spaces.

Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times Talk Thomas Piketty Thinks America Is Primed for Wealth Redistribution  In 2013, the French economist Thomas Piketty, in his best seller “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” a book eagerly received in the wake of the 2008 economic collapse, put forth the notion that returns on capital historically outstrip economic growth (his famous r>g formula). The upshot? The rich get richer, while the rest of us stay stuck in the mud. Now, nearly a decade later, Piketty is set to publish “A Brief History of Equality,” in which he argues that we’re on a trajectory of greater, not less, equality and lays out his prescriptions for remedying our current corrosive wealth disparities. (In short: Tax the rich.) If the line from one book to the other looks slightly askew given the state of the world, then, Piketty suggests, you’re looking from the wrong vantage point. “I am relatively optimistic,” says Piketty, who is 50, “about the fact that there is a long-run movement toward more equality, which goes beyond the little details of what happens within a specific decade.”  In the time since “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was published, there has been a huge proliferation in the number of American billionaires. Something like 130 new ones were added between 2020 and 2021 alone. That happened in the context of growing public discussion — and anger — about economic inequality. So what the hell happened? What enabled the ultrawealthy to flourish in the face of such widespread antipathy? Let me put this very clearly: I understand that each year and each decade is tremendously important, but it’s also important not to forget about the general evolution. We have become much more equal societies in terms of political equality, economic equality, social equality, as compared with 100 years ago, 200 years ago. This movement, which began with the French and U.S. revolutions, I think it is going to continue.  Of course there are structural factors that make it difficult: the system of political finance, the structure of media finance, the basic democratic institutions are less democratic than they should be. This makes things complicated. But it’s always been complicated. The Supreme Court for decades made it impossible to create a progressive income tax. They were fine with the racial segregation, but having a progressive income tax was unconstitutional. In the end, it took 20 years to change the Constitution, but then it happened and contributed to reduced inequality.  OK, so you’re saying that the long-term trend is toward more equality. But in 1990 there were 66 U.S. billionaires. Now there are more than 700. Over the last 40 years or so, chief-executive pay is up more than 900 percent, even accounting for inflation. The average worker’s pay over the same period is up only 12 percent. You believe we should be thinking of those facts as road bumps on the path to greater economic equality? If you take the big picture, yes. But the other lesson from the big picture, from history, is that it takes major political mobilization to keep moving in the direction of equality. In the United States today, the democratic institutions, the rules of the game, are set up in a manner that, indeed, the rich are entrenched. But if you look at opinion polls about a billionaire tax in the U.S. — among Democratic and also Republican voters — you have huge approval. So is the political system able to respond to this, or is it rigged? The lesson from history is that when the political system is rigged, at some point you have a reaction, you have a mobilization.  What did you think of the billionaire tax that Biden just proposed? It would have been better before his election. If you had told the American public before the elections that he wanted a wealth tax — which again is something that is very high in opinion polls — this would have been much easier. This could have forced the Democratic Congress to take a stand. It’s more complicated now. But if it works, it’s better than nothing.  I understand what you’re saying about the popularity of a proposed billionaire tax, but do you believe America is at a place where a phrase like “wealth redistribution,” which is what you’re talking about, is broadly politically plausible? When you say Americans don’t like redistribution, some certainly don’t like it, but in the 20th century, high, progressive taxation of income and inherited wealth was to a large extent invented in the United States. That’s why it always makes me skeptical when people say, Americans don’t like this, don’t like that. Look at history! There’s no deterministic reason why a given country should be this or that. Sometimes, in my country and in the U.S. also, people tell you, “Look, we are not Swedes.” This is used as an argument to say that there is a culture of equality in Sweden, which we would never have.  But Swedes themselves weren’t always “Swedes.” Exactly. Sweden until 1910, 1920 was one of the most unequal countries in the world, with a special sophistication in the way inequality was organized. You could have between one and 100 votes, depending on the size of your wealth. Even corporations had the right to vote in municipal elections in Sweden until 1910. Sweden was like this but then moved to something else.  This is only a half-joking question: Let’s say in the United States the billionaires get sick of being the bad guys and don’t want to be taxed the way Biden is proposing, so they move to Ireland or some other tax haven. Then what happens? But that’s the point: These people don’t live in an autarchy. They rely on the rest of the world, which means that we have to impose rules on the conditions in which they can enjoy these assets — which were produced by the collective. All wealth is collective by nature in the sense that it relies on the work of hundreds, thousands, millions of engineers, technicians, the accumulation of knowledge. Then, private property is a social construction that we invent in order to organize economic and social relations. It’s a very useful social invention as long as you keep under control how much you can accumulate, how much power you can concentrate, etc. But none of these assets are their assets. They are a product of a collective process. No one invented anything by himself or herself.  That kind of ontological argument might be a hard sell for some Americans. For some, but this has nothing to do with the American spirit, American values. It has something to do with a small subset of people who are just pushing their interests. If you ask the American public about who is working hard, is it the normal people or the elite? Whose effort created everything? You will be surprised by the answer.  My sense is that in the very recent past a lot of the growth in wealth has resulted from entrepreneurship rather than the accumulation of inherited wealth. That’s in conjunction with skyrocketing rates of return for the wealthy. Do those factors have any implications for how we understand the accumulation of capital generally or r>g specifically? If you go back to the beginning of the 20th century, late 19th century, you also had lots of new innovation and new wealth. We invented the automobile, electricity, trans-Atlantic radio. People in every time period tend to say today is different, this is big innovation, new wealth, but in a changing economy where we make technological discoveries, you always have this process. But the thing is, if it’s not regulated, if we don’t design institutions in order to spread the wealth — on the contrary, we have an institutional setup where you accumulate wealth by using public infrastructure, public education, the health system, and then once you have accumulated the wealth, you push a button and you transfer it somewhere else. Remember the ProPublica study before the summer of 2021 where they looked at billionaires in the U.S.? They pay almost zero federal income tax, as compared with their wealth. If you pay no tax, it’s easier to accumulate more wealth, and that’s what continues.  An economic argument in favor of billionaires is that their doing well is a sign that our system of capitalism is working and that it means growth for everyone. But growth has been slowing down at the exact same time that billionaires have been rolling in it. Has that given definitive lie to the idea that the success of the 0.1 percent is good for the rest of us, too? It’s proof as far as proof can get in the social and political sciences. The evidence that we have is that if you take the United States, the growth rate of national income per capita has been divided by two following the Reagan decade. It’s been a little more than 1 to 1.2 percent per year — the national income per capita real growth rate between 1990 and 2020. It used to be more than 2, 2.5 percent between 1950 and 1980. The tax performance in the Reagan decade was supposed to boost growth: Maybe you would have more inequality, but the size of the pie is going to grow so much faster than before that the average wages and income of average Americans will grow like you’ve never seen. This is not what we’ve seen.  The big lesson from this is that the period of maximum prosperity of the U.S. economy in the middle of the century was a period where you had a top income-tax rate of 90 percent, 80 percent, and this was not a problem because income gaps of 1 to 100 or 1 to 200 are not necessary for growth. The other big conclusion is that what really matters for economic prosperity is education and relative equality in education. The key reason the U.S. economy was so productive historically in the middle of the 20th century was because of a huge educational advance over Europe. In the 1950s, you have 90 percent of the young generation going to high school in the U.S. At the same time, it’s 20 to 30 percent in Germany, France, Britain, Japan. The story that Reagan tried to tell the country in the ’80s, which is basically forget about equality, the key to prosperity is to let the top become richer and richer — it doesn’t work.  Have you seen any structural or ideological changes that you think make our moment different from historically comparable ones? Well, the dominant ideology has been moving toward the view that we’ve gone too far in terms of market liberalization, in terms of globalization without regulation and the superrich getting richer. The problem is that we’re still stuck with institutions that were set up in the ’80s and ’90s in terms of limited tax progressivity, free capital flows without any common collective regulation, without financial cadastre so that you can track who owns what where — which is a big problem when you want to impose sanctions on oligarchs.  In the United States, this institutional setup has been reinforced because of Trump’s big tax cut on corporations. There are many dramas we associated with Trump, but part of the drama is that he has been able to tell the middle class and lower middle class, “Look, we are going to continue with tax dumping, but I’m going to protect you in another way by protecting you against Chinese and Mexicans, the Muslims.” He was able to be elected on an ideology where you don’t redistribute between the rich and the poor but rather you protect Americans, especially white male Americans, against anybody who looks foreign. The risk is that neoliberalism is replaced by this form of neo-nationalism in order to avoid redistribution. Sometimes people like Trump can be successful with this strategy because it’s a much clearer message than saying, “Let’s look at the history of progressive taxation.”  You mentioned oligarchs. In America, we don’t like to think that we have them — that’s for a country like Russia. Instead we like to think we have entrepreneurs who achieved through merit. But the similarities are obvious: They’re all taking advantage of the free global movement of capital and have a disproportionate amount of political influence. Do you see America as being as securely in the grip of the oligarchic class as other countries we think of as being less democratic? The U.S. oligarchs have less control of the political system than the Putin clique in Russia, that’s for sure. In terms of what fraction of wealth accumulation is due to individual effort, individual merit, as opposed to a legal and institutional system that is working for them more than for the rest of the country, it’s difficult to say. Many Russian oligarchs bought the right assets at the right time, resold it. This is business life.  To me, maybe the best comparison between the U.S. is not so much with Russia today but with Europe and the Belle Époque before 1914: a system which is nominally democratic but where the concentration of wealth is so high and lacking proper rules about political finance, political influence, that the democratic system is not enabled to have a common-sense reaction to this excessive level of inequality that, in the long run, is not good for U.S. prosperity. Particularly because when other countries get more educated than the U.S., then its economic leadership will be gone forever. U.S. economic leadership came from mass education, not from a small elite of billionaires. They have never been the source of U.S. prosperity, and they will never be.  You know, I do find it hard to wrap my head around the idea that after 40 years of worsening inequality, you — the inequality guy, Mr. r>g — are publishing a book saying we’re on the right track historically. It’s sort of cold comfort to know we’re more equal today than we were 100 or 200 years ago. Really give me a reason to feel as optimistic as you do. “Give me a reason to be optimistic?” By looking at my historical evidence, by thinking about the big picture, I have become more optimistic. I was a bit puzzled that many people looking at “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” came away with a pessimistic conclusion. I’m trying to show that the key in history is not the big catastrophes but the positive political construction of an alternative, and this process started with the French Revolution, the U.S. revolution. This process toward more equality is more deeply rooted in our modern ethos and modern political cultures than most people believe. I remember in 2014 having a public discussion with Elizabeth Warren in Boston. I was talking about a progressive wealth tax with a rate of 5 percent per year or 10 percent per year on billionaires. She looked at me like, Wow, that’s too much. Joe Biden today, a centrist Democrat — who voted for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 — is coming in with a wealth tax. Things can change pretty fast.

There, Vladimir Putin, the autocratic head of Russia, launched a military invasion meant to destroy a democracy, and his military appears to be committing horrific atrocities in the process. A crucial part of Russia’s war effort is the economic help that it is receiving from another authoritarian government, China. On the other side of the fight, many democracies — including the U.S. and much of Europe — have rallied to support Ukraine, supplying it with arms and placing harsh economic sanctions on Russia.  But Ukraine is not the only place where the contest between autocracy and democracy is taking place. It is also happening within several European democracies, through elections rather than military conflict. In these countries, politicians who are friendly to Putin — and share his right-wing, nationalist outlook — are trying to win power.  Two of them appear to have succeeded yesterday. In both Hungary and Serbia, incumbent leaders who are supportive of Putin won re-election. A bigger test will occur this month in France, which will hold its own presidential election — and where a victory by the far-right candidate would be a geopolitical earthquake.

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was urgently working on a new round of sanctions against Moscow, adding: “Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area.”  Amid an international outcry following the weekend discovery of a mass grave and corpses with their hands bound in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, Borrell said the EU stood in solidarity with Ukraine during “sombre hours for the whole world”.

Bodies of civilians – many with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture – were found on the streets after Ukrainian troops reclaimed the town.  Ukrainian prosecutors said they had found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv, and 140 bodies had been examined on Sunday. Russia denied allegations that its forces killed civilians as it retreated from war-torn areas of the country.  Satellite images from Bucha appear to show an approximately 45ft-long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave has been identified.  World leaders condemned the killings and called for independent investigations. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, all publicly condemned Russia’s actions.  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described the killings as “a punch to the gut” and joined western allies in vowing to document the atrocities to hold the perpetrators to account.  Russia described the situation in Bucha as a “provocation” by Ukraine intended to disrupt peace talks. The Kremlin’s foreign ministry said Russia was seeking a UN security council meeting on the matter. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s UN security council deputy representative, tweeted on Sunday: “In the light of heinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha Russia requested a meeting of UN security council on Monday April 4.”  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned Russian forces as “murderers”, “torturers” and “rapists” after the killings came to light, describing the Kremlin-ordered attack on his country as amounting to genocide. “How did they also become butchers? … They killed deliberately and with pleasure,” he said in a national address late on Sunday. He vowed to investigate and prosecute all Russian “crimes” in Ukraine.  Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre” while speaking on Times Radio on Sunday. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately.  Zelenskiy criticised the west’s “policy of concessions to Russia” in the lead-up to the war. Describing Ukraine’s past pursuit of Nato membership, he said: “They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us … I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women.”  Russian forces continued their attacks on other Ukrainian cities. Seven people died and 34 were wounded after a residential area in Kharkiv was struck on Sunday, local prosecutors said.  At least 70% of Chernihiv has been destroyed by Russian forces, the city’s mayor said on Sunday. Vladyslav Atroshenko said the “consequences” of the attacks were severe and mirrored those of other badly damaged cities in Ukraine such as Bucha and Mariupol.  Russian forces are continuing to “consolidate and reorganise” their offensive in Donbas, while the capture of Mariupol is a “key objective” of the Russian invasion, UK’s Ministry of Defence said.  The Ukrainian military claims Russia has launched a “hidden mobilisation” of about 60,000 soldiers to replenish units lost in Ukraine, according to its latest operational report.  Russian missiles struck “critical infrastructure”, most likely a fuel depot, near Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa in the early hours of Sunday but there were no casualties, officials in the city said.  The European Union should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia, Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has said.  The huge scale of sexual violence endured by women and girls in Ukraine has begun to emerge as victims recount the abuse they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers.  The United Nations’ human rights office says there have been 3,455 civilian casualties since the war in Ukraine began. The figure includes more than 1,400 deaths and over 2,000 injured people, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher, the agency said in recently published report.

The law enforcement officers on Monday descended on the yacht at the Marina Real in Palma, the capital of Mallorca and the Balearic Islands.  The US, EU and UK have impounded several superyachts that have been linked to some of Russia’s richest men to put pressure on oligarchs thought to be close to Putin after his invasion of Ukraine.  The latest to be immobilised is Tango, the 78-metre Vekselberg-linked vessel that carries the Cook Islands flag of convenience and is registered to a company in the British Virgin Islands. The yacht can host 14 guests in luxury in seven cabins, with a crew of 22, according to the SuperYachtFan website.  Spanish police said in a statement that the yacht was seized as part of investigations into fraud, money laundering and false documents allegedly used to hide ownership of the vessel to avoid sanctions. The raid found documents and devices that have been taken for examination.  US authorities identified Tango as Vekselberg’s asset in March, putting its value at $90m (£70m). The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) also said Vekselberg owned a $90m private jet, an Airbus A319 more usually used by airlines to carry up to 150 passengers.  Vekselberg’s assets were thought to be worth $6bn, Ofac said, with interests spanning energy and other sectors through his Renova Group conglomerate. He built up his wealth primarily through privatisations of Russian oil and aluminium assets in the chaotic aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union.  He was first sanctioned in 2018 by the US in response to Russia’s “malign activity around the globe” including its invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea region, which began in 2014, and support for the regime of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.  Vekselberg has insisted he has had no involvement in activities related to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. In 2019 he told the Financial Times that he was targeted because: “I am Russian. I am rich. And yes, I know Putin. Today, it is enough.”  Before the US sanctions Vekselberg had resettled his family in the US, and he had tried to cultivate close ties with American politicians. He attended Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president in January 2017, and was a board member on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the US’s top universities.  Vekselberg has not been sanctioned by the EU, but was added to the UK’s sanctions list on 15 March. The UK government chose to sanction Vekselberg under an “urgent procedure”, a new tool introduced to allow asset freezes on people sanctioned by allies while the government gathers evidence.

The Tate last month severed ties with Vekselberg after pressure from the Labour MP Chris Bryant.  The Spanish Civil Guard confirmed that officers from the Spanish police and from the FBI were at the marina searching the vessel Monday morning and said further details would be released later.  The FBI was approached for comment. Vekselberg was approached for comment via Renova Group.

In his widely read annual letter to investors, Dimon urged Joe Biden’s administration to take a stronger stance against the “grave new geopolitical realities” emerging after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it was up to democratic nations to take a stand “against all forms of evil”.  Dimon, who is one of the most high-profile bosses to comment on the conflict so far, also detailed the bank’s potential $1bn losses because of its direct exposure to Russia. JP Morgan announced it was winding down its Russia operations – which employ about 160 staff – last month.  “As I write this letter, the war in Ukraine has been raging for well over a month and is creating a significant refugee crisis. We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact. They have roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural markets,” he said.  However, Dimon said the war’s wider impact, including the “potential restructuring of the global order – is far more important”.  Noting that the war could impact geopolitics for decades, he added: “We must confront the Russia challenge with bold solutions.”  Dimon urged the US to develop a Marshall plan that would reduce the west’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels – referring to Harry Truman’s 1948 aid programme that helped western Europe recover from the second world war. “Our European allies, who are highly dependent on Russian energy, require our help,” he said.  “As we are seeing – and know from past experience – oil and gas supply can be easily disrupted, either physically or by additional sanctions, significantly impacting energy prices. National security demands energy security for ourselves and for our allies overseas,” he said.  Tensions are already escalating over the demand by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that, from 1 April, all gas bought by foreign countries must be paid for in roubles. G7 countries have so far rejected Moscow’s request.  The banking chief added that the US response should also involve a larger US military budget and deploying more troops to Nato’s borders “as appropriate”, adding that the US government should pledge billions of dollars to rebuild Ukraine and support migrants in Europe.  “America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We must look at this as a wake-up call,” the letter urged.  “We need to make this a permanent, long-lasting stand for democratic ideals and against all forms of evil.”  Dimon also urged Biden’s administration to “turn up sanctions”, but acknowledged the move would have economic repercussions beyond Russia’s borders. “Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation,” Dimon added.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  JP Morgan’s analysts already predict that the euro area’s GDP will grow by roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the 4.5% expected before the invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the US is only expected to experience GDP growth of 2.5% compared with previous estimates of 3% for 2022.  He added that the US should restructure its supply chains and make sure it no longer relied on countries with “different strategic interests” to provide materials deemed crucial for national security, like rare earths or semiconductors. Instead, the US should only rely on domestic firms or “completely friendly allies” for key goods and services.  “We cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us, especially when we are most vulnerable,” Dimon said.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the US president noted the importance of gathering evidence of war crimes and was asked if genocide had been committed. He replied: “No, I think it’s a war crime.”  He said: “I’m going to continue to add more sanctions.” Asked for details, he said: “I’ll let you know.”  Biden’s comments to reporters came after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. Zelenskiy called the Russian actions “genocide” and called for the west to apply tougher sanctions against Russia.  The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, north-west of the capital.  The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted on Monday that the European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general document war crimes.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was urgently working on a new round of sanctions against Moscow, adding: “Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area.”  Amid an international outcry following the weekend discovery of a mass grave and corpses with their hands bound in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, Borrell said the EU stood in solidarity with Ukraine during “sombre hours for the whole world”.  As the UN security council prepared to discuss Ukraine on Tuesday, the international body’s human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, told its human rights council that strikes and heavy shelling during Russia’s invasion had killed civilians in acts that may amount to war crimes.  The security council would not meet on Monday, as requested by Russia, to discuss what Moscow called Ukraine’s “heinous provocation”, said the British mission, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April.  The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on a visit to Bucha the atrocities would necessarily complicate peace talks due to restart by video on Monday. The killings were “war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide”, Zelenskiy said. “We know that thousands of people have been killed and tortured.”  Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called for an international investigation into what he termed a “genocide” carried out by Russian troops, saying it was essential to “find out the truth on the extent of Russian fascist crimes”.  Urging tougher western sanctions and an end to “negotiations with criminals”, Morawiecki said the “bloody massacres committed by Russian soldiers deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide, and it must be judged.”  The Polish leader criticised efforts over the past several weeks by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to keep lines of communication open with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, saying: “Nobody negotiated with Hitler.”  He told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that Berlin, which fears the economic consequences of suddenly halting imports of Russian gas, should not be listening to “German business leaders and German billionaires”, but “the voices of innocent women and children”.  Macron said on Monday there were very “clear clues pointing to war crimes” by Russian forces in Bucha and that new sanctions were needed, including on Russian oil and coal. Scholz said Putin and his supporters “will feel the consequences” and new sanctions would be agreed in the coming days.  Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, raised the possibility of an end to gas imports, while the foreign minister of Italy – another country reliant on Russian gas – said it would not veto energy sanctions. Other European officials, including the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said the EU “must respond strongly”.  Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the west must do everything in its power to ensure those responsible for “these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and – why not say it too – genocide” did not go unpunished.  The Kremlin, which has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, on Monday rejected all accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha, saying Ukrainian allegations should be treated with scepticism and suggesting images of corpses “do not correspond to reality”.  “We categorically reject all allegations,” said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claiming that Russian defence ministry experts had “identified signs of video fakes and various fakes” and asking international leaders not to “rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments”.  Officials in Brussels said a fresh set of punitive measures against Moscow would be discussed this week, with EU foreign ministers due to consider the package either on the sidelines of a Nato meeting on Wednesday and Thursday or early next week.  Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating possible war crimes by Russian forces after finding 421 bodies in civilian clothes, some with their hands tied, strewn around several towns outside the capital, including Bucha, after Moscow’s troops withdrew from the area around the capital.  Showing their partially covered bodies to reporters, Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, said on Monday the head of one village, Motyzhyn, her husband and their son had all been shot and buried in a shallow grave.  “The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery,” Herashchenko said. “These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be held responsible for this.”  Zelenskiy on Sunday described Russian soldiers as “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, and warned that “even worse things” could be found in other occupied regions.  The US said on Monday it would ask the UN general assembly to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council after the atrocities. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights.  Speaking in Bucharest on Monday, Washington’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “Russia’s participation on the human rights council is a farce. And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN general assembly vote to remove them.”  The Kremlin said Russia’s diplomats at the UN would press on with their efforts to convene a security council meeting despite their first effort being blocked.  Europe’s worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has already killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates. The UN refugee agency said on Monday more than 4.2 million refugees had fled the country.  “The humanitarian needs are growing by the minute as more people flee the war in Ukraine,” the International Organization for Migration said, adding that in addition to Ukrainian refugees, nearly 205,500 non-Ukrainians living, studying or working in the country had left and nearly 6.5 million people were internally displaced.

Berlin has so far pushed back on appeals for an outright ban on energy imports from Russia, warning that the consequences for Europe’s largest economy and the entire European Union would be devastating. However, discussions are widespread about reducing industry production times to save energy, while ordinary Germans are being urged to turn down thermostats and drive more slowly.  Pressure from Germany’s neighbours has been growing, particularly the Baltic states and Poland. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland, on Monday accused Germany of “standing in the way” of harder sanctions against Russia. “Anyone who reads the notes of EU meetings knows that Germany is the biggest impediment when it comes to more decisive sanctions,” he told journalists in Warsaw.  A spokesperson for the German government said it would not be considering an immediate energy embargo but it was determined to speed up its efforts to wean Germany off Russian gas and oil.  “After these pictures of the weekend, we will once again see how we can more quickly, and by using further measures, reduce our dependence,” said Oliver Krischer, from the ministry for the economy and climate protection, on Monday morning. Efforts were being made to introduce a “quasi-embargo”, he said, through “non-purchase” and “energy-saving measures” as well as “diversification”, including buying liquefied petroleum gas.  Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the atrocities – in which hundreds of civilians are believed to have been murdered north of Kyiv – would not go unanswered, calling them war crimes, and promised on Sunday night that Germany, together with its partners, would be increasing sanctions against Russia in the coming days.  The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, later went further, saying it was time for the EU to jointly discuss the option of a complete ban on Russian gas. “There must be a response,” she said in a television interview. “Such crimes cannot remain unanswered.  But in a sign of debate even within the governing coalition, the finance minister, Christian Lindner, rejected a gas embargo. “We are dealing with a criminal war,” Lindner said before talks with his EU colleagues in Brussels. “It is clear we must end as quickly as possible all economic ties to Russia. We must plan tough sanctions, but gas cannot be substituted in the short term. We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them.”  Opinion polls have shown that the majority of Germans – between 55% and 77% – are in favour of stopping imports of gas from Russia, despite the impact it might have on their ability to heat their own homes. The majority said they were also in favour of temporarily increasing the lifespan of coal-fired plants and of making nuclear power plants – the phase-out of which began following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 – operational again.  As a whole, Europe gets about 40% of its gas supplies from Russia. In Germany, the figure is 55%, the highest dependency of any European state. The EU gets 25% of its oil from Russia. Sanctions could be discussed by EU foreign ministers on the sidelines of a Nato meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday said he was in favour of a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil and coal sectors, but did not call for a EU ban on gas imports.  Macron was named by Morawiecki as he called for European leaders to do more against Russia. “President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin? What have you achieved? ... Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?” he asked.  “Chancellor Scholz, Olaf, it is not the voices of German businesses that should be heard aloud in Berlin today. It is the voice of these innocent women and children.”  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had on Sunday accused the former German chancellor Angela Merkel and the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy of contributing to Russian aggression by making too many concessions towards Putin.  “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and to see for their own eyes where the politics of making concessions to Russia in over 14 years has led. You will see tortured Ukrainian men and women with your own eyes,” he said in his nightly video address to Ukrainians.  In particular, he levelled criticism at Merkel for not backing Ukraine’s attempts to join Nato in 2008.  Merkel’s office responded unusually swiftly to the criticism. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The retired German chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decision in conjunction with the Nato summit in Bucharest in 2008.” The spokesperson added that Merkel supported every effort of the German government to stop Russia’s invasion, especially in light of the “atrocities of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine”.  Germany’s economics minister, Robert Habeck, who as a leading Green has pushed for years for the abolition of coal-fired plants and the scrapping of nuclear power plants, said Germany was working on reducing its reliance on Russian energy but that it could not happen overnight.  “We are working every single day to create the preconditions and to pave the way towards an embargo,” he said when asked if news of the murder of civilians in Bucha would lead to a government rethink. “This is also, in the view of the federal government, as well as in my own opinion, the way forward and one which harms Putin on a daily basis.”

It was not a choice,” said one woman who had been hiding with her family in a suburb of Mariupol since early March. “People need to know the truth, that Ukrainians are being moved to Russia, the country that is occupying us.”  Ukrainian officials have accused Russian troops of transporting several thousand Mariupol residents through “filtration camps” and forcibly moving them to Russia through the Russian-controlled republics in eastern Ukraine.  The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has denied these accusations, claiming “such reports are lies”. Russian officials have previously said 420,000 people have been voluntarily evacuated to Russia “from dangerous regions of Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics”.  The women requested anonymity because they were concerned about the safety of their relatives who are still in the heavily shelled city. Their accounts, along with similar stories published by the Washington Post and the BBC and reports from human rights groups, contradict Russian claims that Ukrainians are not being forcibly moved to Russia.  The southern port of Mariupol came under heavy fire from Russian forces soon after the invasion of Ukraine, with many families seeking refuge in bomb shelters. Russian troops have since taken control of large parts of the damaged city.  After leaving her shelter, the first woman said she was bussed with “two or three hundred” others to the border town Novoazovsk, in the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine.  “Once we came to a stop, we had to wait for hours inside the bus until ordered to go through a large tent complex, to what everyone called ‘filtration camps’.”  A satellite image captured by the US-based Maxar Technologies last week showed tented camps set up in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne, near Novoazovsk. Representatives of the two self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas have said they have set up a “tent city of 30 tents” for Mariupol residents, with the capacity to hold up to 450 people.  Satellite image of tents in Bezimenne village near Mariupol. Photograph: Maxar  A report in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a newspaper owned by the Russian government, said that 5,000 Ukrainians had been processed at the camp in Bezimenne and undergone checks to prevent “Ukrainian nationalists from infiltrating Russia disguised as refugees so they could avoid punishment”.  The woman described how she was photographed and fingerprinted once she entered the camp. She was then “extensively questioned” by men who presented themselves as members of Russia’s FSB security service.  “They went through my phone; they asked if I knew anything about the Ukrainian army, if I had friends in the military,” she said. “They also asked me what I thought about Ukraine, about Putin and about the conflict. It was very degrading.”  After passing through the “filtration camp”, which took a few hours, according to the woman, the group was eventually taken to Rostov, a city 80 miles (130km) east of the Ukrainian border. Once there, the group was told that their final destination would be Vladimir, a city just over 100 miles (160km) east of Moscow.  But in Rostov, the woman decided to separate from the main group, telling the Russian guards she had family living there. “They let me go without much hassle. But for many, leaving was simply not an option,” she said.  The woman recalled that many on the bus complained that they were given only a few minutes to gather their belongings and often did not have any money or official papers, making it complicated to leave Russia afterwards. After separating from the group, the woman made her way first to Moscow by bus and then took a train to St Petersburg. She said she was now safe after crossing the border to an EU country on foot.  The scale of Russia’s reported forced deportations remains unclear. The Helping to Leave Fund, a Russian-run group that addresses the needs of people relocated to Russia from Ukraine, said they had received about 200 requests from deported Ukrainians asking them for help.  “Each of those requests usually comes from a whole family, so the actual number of people deported is higher,” said Maria Ivanova, a representative of the group.  Ivanova said the group saw an increase in requests for help from 28 March and heard first-hand reports of “long lines” at the “filtration camps”.  The reported deportations have raised alarm among international human rights groups.  “These people weren’t given any option to evacuate to a safer place in Ukraine. Many found themselves in a situation when their only choice was essentially crossing into Russia or dying as shelling grew more intense,” said Tatyana Lokshina, associate director for the Human Rights Watch’s Europe and central Asia division.  “Under international human rights law, forced displacement or transfer doesn’t necessarily mean people were forced into a vehicle at gunpoint, but rather that they found themselves in a situation that left them no choice.”  Lokshina pointed to the Geneva convention, under which “individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory, are prohibited, regardless of their motive”.  A second woman the Guardian talked to gave a similar account of her forced transport from Mariupol through a “filtration camp” in Novoazovsk.  “I never asked to be taken away. The filtration camps, the journey, it has been very traumatic,” said the woman, who left the city on a Russian bus on 16 March.  She is currently in Rostov, planning her route out of the country.  Russian officials have openly talked about their efforts to relocate what they call “Ukrainian temporarily displaced people.”  The Russian defence ministry has posted almost daily about its efforts to evacuate Ukrainian civilians “trapped” in Mariupol.  The governor of Vladimir told local media that his city had received over 1,000 “refugees” from territories “liberated” by Russia, including Mariupol.  Not everyone who has been moved from Ukraine to Russia said they were unhappy to do so.  “I wanted to go to Russia; I am glad to be safe. And my family lives here, so I was looking for how to get here,” said Vladimira, a third woman from Mariupol who spoke to the Guardian, who has since moved in with family members in Rostov.  Mariupol is just 37 miles from the Russian border, and many of its residents have relatives on the other side. While the invasion has dramatically decreased pro-Russian sentiment in the city, Vladimira said she welcomed the safety that she felt moving to Russia offered.  She also confirmed that she had gone through “filtration camps” but said they did not bother her as she was just “glad to be out of danger”.  “There is certainly a group of people that have been moved out of Mariupol who will not mind being in Russia. Who will stay there,” said Ivanova from the Helping to Leave Fund. “But we know of hundreds who were moved against their will. That is extremely worrying.”

The city once of 40,000 people is a gateway to the Donbas region. It has been a battleground since the start of the war, and although on Friday it fell to Russian forces, residents and military officials say intense fighting continues close to the city.  “For three weeks there has been no civilisation. The city has been brought to ruins and intentionally so,” said Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor of Izyum, who has left the city but is working nearby and speaks to residents regularly.  This is the story of one family in the city. Names have been changed to protect sources from possible Russian reprisals.  “Yesterday morning started with hell,” my father, Andriy, told me when he called from Izyum last week. “There were as many bombs as there have been in the past month. The town centre was heavily bombed. It is shelled every minute. Even now when I tried to call you it’s going on.”  Like all the residents of the occupied city, my father, 57, has survived for three weeks without electricity, heating or running water. He spends 15 minutes a day trying to “catch” the unstable mobile phone connection to call me.  His house is now surrounded by trenches and destroyed houses and his new neighbours are Russian soldiers. They have prepared a list of individuals to “hunt”, people who may own a gun, are rich or “dangerous”, including businessmen, activists, military and their families. My father observed one hunt for a local businessman, who had already escaped when the raiding party arrived.  To survive he takes water from the neighbours’ well, lives off preserves and dried food supplies and usually cooks on an open fire. He abandoned his bed at the start of the war and now sleeps in a corner of the house where he feels more protected by walls. “I’m already used to the cold. I sleep under two duvets and take the cat with me,” he told me. At that time it was snowing there.  “You don’t hear when the bomb is coming. You just hear it half a second before it lands,” he said. Half the neighbours’ house has been destroyed. When the artillery starts, our house creaks and trembles. He hides our dog in the cellar.  “Today I went to the city. God, everything is destroyed, there is not a single building still standing. First came the Russian planes, then came the answering fire,” he said.  Authorities describe a list of war crimes recounted by those who have fled, which match reports from other parts of Ukraine. Russian soldiers have been accused of rape, kidnap, killing civilians and looting shops and homes. They have moved into civilian homes, in some cases kicking out residents, according to authorities.  Many of Izyum’s residents are hiding in their basements, and some have died there under the rubble. Rescue workers do not have the right equipment to get people out after attacks, says Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor.  There is nowhere to bury those who are found. “Some corpses are buried in the central park or near to the people’s houses and in gardens. The situation is like what it was in 1942. The morgue doesn’t work. Bodies were taken there at first but now it is too full,” Matsokin said.  There are Russian bodies too, abandoned by their comrades in arms. “I have seen three armed vehicles full of corpses. There were bodies even lying on the roofs,” my father said.  Shortages are costing lives. With the fighting and the Russian checkpoints barring passage of humanitarian convoys, food and medicine are running out. The hospital has been partly destroyed and people with diabetes or cancer cannot get treatment.  My grandparents are still in the city. I haven’t seen them for two months or spoken to them for a month, after they refused to leave. They lived in a Ukrainian-controlled area but moved to the occupied part to stay with other family members who live there.  They had not believed the war could start. As children of the Soviet Union, they were sure that Russia would never attack.  At least 5,000 people need to be evacuated from the city but there is no safe way to escape any more. All of the bridges have been blown up, and the only crossing left is a partly destroyed footbridge.  “I feel like it will take months to stop the war,” my father said during our last call, as the explosions continued. “I can’t imagine how it will end. Stalingrad continues.”

Solaris, which is 140 metres long and has a helipad and swimming pool, left Bodrum Cruise Port on Monday. It is now at anchor off Yalikavak beach in south-eastern Turkey, according to the shipping data service Marine Traffic.  Pressure had been building for Global Ports Holding (GPH), the Mayfair-headquartered company that runs Bodrum Cruise Port, to refuse services to Solaris.  Legal experts had said the London-listed company was taking “a very big risk” by allowing a superyacht owned by a sanctioned individual to use one of its ports. The Bodrum port is one of 22 terminals run by the firm.  Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, is one of several Russian billionaires hit by UK sanctions last month as part of the government’s efforts to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, described the sanctioned individuals as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”.  A spokesperson for Global Ports Holding declined to comment on why Solaris had left the port.  In a statement on Sunday, the company said it did not have “any power to accept or reject any ship or yacht” from the port but it had taken the decision to “not receive any service fee or other payments concerning the berthing of this superyacht”.  “Global Ports Holding plc notes recent press speculation regarding the berthing at Bodrum Yolcu Liman İşletmeleri AŞ (Bodrum Cruise Port), Turkey, of a superyacht, allegedly owned by a designated person subject to sanctions imposed by the UK government,” GPH said.  “As a private terminal operator in Turkey, GPH merely operates Bodrum Cruise Port as the concessionaire and is not involved in granting permission for a ship or a yacht to dock at the port. This responsibility and decision sit with the Turkish authorities, and as concessionaire, GPH must comply with such a decision as long as the decision is legal under the applicable laws.  “However, and notwithstanding the difficulties of any party to correctly identify the actual ownership of such assets, GPH has not and will not receive any service fee or other payments concerning the berthing of this superyacht at Bodrum Cruise Port.”  The company said the berthing of Solaris did not breach UK sanction laws because “the alleged offence has taken place at a port outside the United Kingdom where GPH does not have any ownership or any power to accept or reject any ship or yacht pursuant to the applicable laws”.  Solaris arrived at Bodrum Cruise Port on 22 March after hurriedly leaving a port in Barcelona, where it was undergoing repairs, as EU countries began seizing sanctioned individuals’ assets.  Ukrainian protesters tried to stop Solaris mooring at the port. Members of the Optimist Sailing Team Ukraine confronted the vessel in a small boat, chanting “No war in Ukraine” and waving the country’s flag. They were part of a junior sailing team that was in Turkey to compete in an annual competition, having left Ukraine before the invasion.  Turkey has refused to impose sanctions on Russians, despite the UK, US and EU uniting to restrict oligarchs believed to have benefited from close relationships with Putin. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said the oligarchs were “of course” welcome and could do business in Turkey according to international law.

Eclipse, which at 162.5 metres is believed to be the world’s second largest superyacht, arrived at the port of Marmaris on 22 March.  Reports suggest that Abramovich owns as many as five superyachts worth more than $1bn (£762m) in total. Another yacht linked to the billionaire, Garcon, is now berthed in Antigua.  The Antiguan government has asked for the UK’s assistance to seize the vessel. Ronald Sanders, the country’s ambassador to the US, told Reuters: “We’ve said that we’re quite happy to cooperate, but under the rule of law. The only way we can [seize the vessel] is if the British, in their mutual legal assistance treaty request, establish that this is a person they want because he has committed some crime.”

The world was horrified on Sunday by a picture taken by the photographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway 20km outside the capital, Kyiv, in which the bodies of one man and three women were piled under a blanket. The women were naked and their bodies had been partially burned, the photographer said.  The harrowing image adds to a mounting body of evidence that summary executions, rape and torture have been used against civilians in areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched the invasion of its neighbour on 24 February.  Particularly difficult for many to comprehend is the scale of the sexual violence. As Russian troops have withdrawn from towns and suburbs around the capital in order to refocus the war effort on Ukraine’s east, women and girls have come forward to tell the police, media and human rights organisations of atrocities they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers. Gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies collected by investigators.  “We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance, but in most cases it’s been impossible to help them physically. We haven’t been able to reach them because of the fighting,” said Kateryna Cherepakha, the president of La Strada Ukraine, a charity that supports survivors of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault.  “Rape is an underreported crime and stigmatised issue even in peaceful times. I am worried that what we learn about is just going to be the tip of the iceberg.”  Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and a breach of international humanitarian law, and both Ukraine’s prosecutor general and the international Criminal Court have said they will open investigations into reported sexual violence. But what currently seems like a far-off possibility of justice has done little to assuage Ukrainian women’s fears of what may yet happen in a war that is far from over.  Antonina Medvedchuk, 31, said that when she woke up to the sound of bombing on the day the war broke out, the first things she grabbed before leaving Kyiv were condoms and scissors to use as a weapon to protect herself.  “Every break between curfew and bombing I was looking for emergency contraception instead of a basic first aid kit,” she said. “My mother tried to reassure me: ‘This is not a war like that, they don’t exist anymore, they are from old movies.’ I have been a feminist for eight years, and I cried in silence, because all wars are like this.”  It is not only Russian soldiers Ukrainian women may have to protect themselves from. In Vinnytsia, a town in the west of the country, a teacher reported to police that a member of the territorial defence services dragged her into the school library and tried to rape her. The man was arrested.  Organisations such as La Strada Ukraine and a countrywide network called Feminist Workshop have been working online and with local government to distribute information about medical, legal and psychological support available for victims of sexual assault, and are trying to find safe shelters for women and girls fleeing both the war and domestic violence.  They fear, however, that the trauma caused by the use of rape as a military tactic will lead to deep suffering across Ukrainian society for years to come.  “When a woman gets away it looks like she’s safe, she’s far away from the guns and the man who raped her,” said Sasha Kantser, external affairs manager for the Lviv chapter of Feminist Workshop, which has helped hundreds of displaced women and girls since the war broke out.  “But the trauma is a bomb inside her, that follows her. The scale of what is happening now is heartbreaking.”

Greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025, and can be nearly halved this decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  The final cost of doing so will be minimal, amounting to just a few percent of global GDP by mid-century, though it will require a massive effort by governments, businesses and individuals.  But the chances were narrow and the world was failing to make the changes needed, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists warned. Temperatures will soar to more than 3C, with catastrophic consequences, unless policies and actions are urgently strengthened.  Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report, said: “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”  The report on Monday was the third and final section of the IPCC’s latest comprehensive review of climate science, drawing on the work of thousands of scientists. IPCC reports take about seven years to compile, making this potentially the last warning before the world is set irrevocably on a path to climate breakdown.  Though the report found it was now “almost inevitable” that temperatures would rise above 1.5C – the level above which many of the effects of climate breakdown will become irreversible – the IPCC said it could be possible to bring them back down below the critical level by the end of this century. But doing so could require technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which campaigners warned were unproven and could not be a substitute for deep emissions cuts now.  The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said some governments and businesses were “lying” in claiming to be on track for 1.5C. In a strongly worded rebuke, he warned: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.”  Soaring energy prices and the war in Ukraine have prompted governments to rethink their energy policies. Many countries – including the US, the UK and the EU – are considering ramping up fossil fuels as part of their response, but the IPCC report made clear that increasing fossil fuels would put the 1.5C target beyond reach.  Guterres said: “Inflation is rising, and the war in Ukraine is causing food and energy prices to skyrocket. But increasing fossil fuel production will only make matters worse.”  John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, called the report “a defining moment for our planet” and warned governments must move faster. “The report tells us that we are currently falling short in our battle to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis and mobilise the urgent global action needed. But importantly, the report also tells us we have the tools we need to reach our goals, cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, reach net zero by 2050, and secure a healthier, cleaner planet,” he said.  The IPCC working group 3 report found:  Coal must be effectively phased out if the world is to stay within 1.5C, and currently planned new fossil fuel infrastructure would cause the world to exceed 1.5C.  Methane emissions must be reduced by a third.  Growing forests and preserving soils will be necessary, but tree-planting cannot do enough to compensate for continued emissions for fossil fuels.  Investment in the shift to a low-carbon world is about six times lower than it needs to be.  All sectors of the global economy, from energy and transport to buildings and food, must change dramatically and rapidly, and new technologies including hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage will be needed.  Pete Smith, a professor of soils and global change at Aberdeen University, said: “The time of reckoning is now. We have one decade to get on track. We use fossil fuels in all these things that we need to change.”  Poor countries warned they were ill-equipped to make the changes needed and required financial assistance from richer nations to cut emissions and help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the chair of the least developed countries group at the UN climate talks, said: “There can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure. The emissions from existing and planned infrastructure alone are higher than scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot. We cannot afford to lock in the use of fossil fuels.”  Catherine Mitchell, a professor emerita of energy policy at Exeter University, said the needs of the poorest countries must be prioritised. “Unless we have social justice, there are not going to be more accelerated greenhouse gas reductions. These issues are tied together.”  Publication of the report was delayed by a few hours as governments wrangled with scientists in marathon sessions, culminating late on Sunday night, over the final messages in the 63-page summary for policymakers. While IPCC reports are led by scientists, governments have input on the final messages in the summary for policymakers.  The Guardian understands that governments including India, Saudi Arabia and China questioned messages including on financing emissions reductions in the developing world and phasing out fossil fuels. However, scientists stressed that the final summary was agreed by all 195 governments.  This was the third instalment of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, covering ways of reducing emissions. It follows a first section published last August that warned human changes to the climate were becoming irreversible; and a second section published at the end of February warning of catastrophic impacts.

Interviewed on morning radio, the president said he was surprised by the increasing tendency of people to ask what point there was in voting.  “Is it useful? Yes. If I hadn’t had a real mandate five years ago I couldn’t have done what I have done. Only the vote gives that legitimacy,” he told France Inter.  “Many people sign up to causes, petitions, movements … but don’t necessarily vote. Causes are important … but the profound changes we can make to society come when we vote.”  Six days from the first round, which will select a final two candidates, polls are still suggesting Macron is favourite to win the first round and face Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally in the runoff on 24 April, a repeat of 2017.  However, with Le Pen closing the first-round gap, at 22% against Macron’s 28.5% and the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon seven points behind her, political analysts and pollsters have said that the result is far from a foregone conclusion. Support for all far-right candidates is now running at about 35%.  Macron admitted that during his five years in the Élysée, marked by the Covid pandemic and more recently the war in Ukraine, he had failed to persuade people to shun the political extremes.  “I didn’t succeed in convincing people that the extreme right is not the answer,” he said.  During the interview, Macron also reiterated his determination to reform the country’s pension system, a proposal that sparked more than a month of strikes in France in 2019-2020, the worst industrial action to hit the country since the previous attempt to reform pensions in 2010. If re-elected he said he would raise the retirement age from 62 to 65 apart from a few special exceptions and introduce a minimum pension of €1,100 (about £925) a month that would be index linked.  “I want to defend the system … in which those in work pay the pensions of the retired. I want to defend this system, but we cannot carry on as things are. The system is in the red. Those on low pensions are struggling,” he said.  “All those who tell you we can keep pensions as they are today are lying. Today on average, people don’t stop working at 62, they carry on until 63.5 years. And several million of our citizens – many of them women doing tough jobs – work until 67. There’s a kind of hypocrisy about this.”  He has promised reforms of the health and education systems that have also raised hackles among workers. However, he said he was not planning to force 12-year-olds into apprenticeships as Mélenchon has claimed. “This is fake news,” he said.  Macron said he was shocked by images of alleged massacres in Ukraine and called for more severe sanctions and “clear measures” against Moscow, saying there was clear evidence the Russian army had committed war crimes.  Under election rules, campaigning will stop on Friday at midnight so candidates have until then to persuade French voters. The far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour, who is fourth or fifth in the polls has ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric, pledging to expel 1 million foreigners if elected. The centre-right Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse, currently polling at the same level, says voters need to revolt to avoid a Le Pen v Macron runoff, while the Socialist party’s Anne Hidalgo, currently languishing far down the polls, has urged those in the “leftwing family” to support her.

In his widely read annual letter to investors, Dimon urged Joe Biden’s administration to take a stronger stance against the “grave new geopolitical realities” emerging after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it was up to democratic nations to take a stand “against all forms of evil”.  Dimon, who is one of the most high-profile bosses to comment on the conflict so far, also detailed the bank’s potential $1bn losses because of its direct exposure to Russia. JP Morgan announced it was winding down its Russia operations – which employ about 160 staff – last month.  He wrote:  “As I write this letter, the war in Ukraine has been raging for well over a month and is creating a significant refugee crisis. We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact. They have roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural markets.”  However, Dimon said the war’s wider impact, including the “potential restructuring of the global order – is far more important”.  Noting that the war could impact geopolitics for decades, he added: “We must confront the Russia challenge with bold solutions.”

Ecstatic chants of “Viktor, Viktor” greeted Orbán as he addressed supporters of his Fidesz party outside its election headquarters on the banks of the Danube in Budapest as results made the scale of his victory apparent.  With nearly 86% of the vote counted on Sunday night, Fidesz was on course to increase its parliamentary majority by winning 135 seats in the 199-member parliament, crushing a six-party opposition bloc that united to form a common front aimed at unseating Orbán.  Instead, the ruling party has retained its two-thirds super majority, which has enabled it to reshape Hungarian politics and social policy during its 12 years in power.  The popular vote margin was 53.7% for Fidesz to 34.4% for the United for Hungary opposition grouping, fronted by Péter Márki-Zay, who conceded defeat on Sunday night.  “The entire world can see that our brand of Christian democratic, conservative, patriotic politics has won,” a smiling, swaggering Orbán – with members of his cabinet behind him – told the crowd, standing in frigid temperatures. “We are sending Europe a message that this is not the past – this is the future.”  Orbán also made reference to criticism directed at him by Zelenskiy, who has repeatedly challenged the Hungarian leader over a perceived lack of support and an unwillingness to condemn his close ally Vladimir Putin in person for the invasion of Ukraine.  “This victory is one to remember, maybe even for the rest of our lives, because we had the biggest [range of opponents to] overpower. The left at home, the international left, the bureaucrats in Brussels, the money of the Soros empire, the international media and even the Ukrainian president in the end,” he said to laughter from the crowd.  The opposition bloc led by Péter Márki-Zay has complained about a huge imbalance in election spending and communication. Photograph: Márton Mónus/Reuters  Conceding defeat, Márki-Zay said he was “devastated” and attributed its scale to Fidesz’s gerrymandering methods and other changes to the voting system while in office.  “I don’t want to hide my disappointment and my sadness. We never expected this to be the result,” he said.  “We knew beforehand that this was going to be an imbalanced fight. Yes, they’ve cheated too. But we’ve also said that since there is no democracy in Hungary and they’ve changed the whole system, the districts.”  Orbán’s party has strengthened its hold on office through a favourable media ownership structure and changes to the voting system that critics say renders elections unfair.  Márki-Zay, a 49-year-old economist, has complained bitterly that he was given only five minutes of airtime on public TV to state his case.  The opposition has also complained that Fidesz has a huge advantage in election spending and communication. It said it had about 2,000 election advertising billboards throughout the country to 20,000 for the governing party.  Akos Hadhazy, an opposition MP, said: “Orbán can get any of his lies to Hungarian people. Even if we hire the best communication experts, the government will always win these races because they can get their messages to much more people than we can.”  Even before polls closed, opponents called attention to possible voter fraud – the possibility of which prompted the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to dispatch a 200-strong team of election observers.  The OSCE’s office for democratic institutions and human rights has criticised what it said was blatant gerrymandering in several constituencies. Analysts predicted that gerrymandering would mean United for Hungary needed to win about 5% more of the popular vote than Fidesz to stand a chance of gaining a parliamentary majority.  The Clean Vote Coalition – a grouping of four Hungarian NGOs – said it had received numerous complaints of irregularities. They included electors being offered 10,000 Hungarian forints (£23) for their vote and, in another location, meat being on offer as an inducement. There were also reports of illegal bussing of voters.  Fears of fraud had been fuelled before polling day after a large number of election ballots – most of them said to be for opposition candidates – were reportedly found partly burned in a sack at a landfill site last week in the Romanian region of Transylvania, where many ethnic Hungarians have dual citizenship and voting rights.  Fidesz’s victory came after high voter turnout – a factor experts assessed would help the governing party – despite frigid temperatures and wintery weather.  Orbán’s fourth term, which will become his fifth overall, may also pose a possible conundrum for Nato and the EU amid mounting concerns over Hungary’s attitude to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and whether it is a reliable alliance partner.  Although Orbán has so far not attempted to block sanctions and military responses to the attack, he signalled an unwillingness to contemplate measures that would cut supplies of Russian oil and gas.  He has also refused to allow the supply of weapons to Ukraine or permit military aid to pass through Hungarian territory, angering Nato allies and Zelenskiy, who has branded him Putin’s sole European supporter.  Orbán, who has forged a close relationship with the Russian leader and met him 12 times, retooled his election campaign after the outbreak of war on 24 February to position Fidesz as the “peace” party, vowing to stay out of a conflict that he insisted had nothing to do with Hungary.  He said reducing energy dependency on Russia – which provides an estimated 90% of its gas and 65% of its oil – would wreck Hungary’s economy.  At the same time, he cast Márki-Zay’s opposition bloc, which has called for closer cooperation with the EU and Nato, as “warmongers” who strove to send weapons and Hungarian troops to Ukraine.  There has been speculation that Orbán – who has consistently forged bonds with Russia and China, cast the EU as an enemy, and styled himself in recent years as “illiberal” leader – would pivot to a more pro-western stance after securing his re-election.  However, Daniel Hegedus, a Hungarian analyst with the German Marshall Fund, played down such expectations.  “There may be some realignment towards the west, but in general what he is seeking is a return to business as usual with Russia – both in terms of energy cooperation and economic cooperation,” he said.  Orbán’s stance on the war has left Hungary increasingly isolated among its western allies but has proved popular among voters, especially those in rural areas.

Trolling, fake news and “doing your own research” have become such a part of public discourse, it’s sometimes easy to imagine that all the online revolution has brought us is a myriad of new ways to be confused about the world.  Social media has played a particularly significant role in the spread of disinformation. Malicious state enterprises such as the notorious Russian “troll farm” are part of this, certainly. But there is a more powerful mechanism: the way it brings together people, whether flat earthers or anti-vaxxers, who would find it difficult to meet like-minded folks in the real world. Today, if you’re convinced our planet isn’t round, you don’t have to resort to standing on street corners with a sign, shouting at passersby. Instead you have access to an online community of tens of thousands of individuals producing content that not only tells you you’re right, but also builds a web of pseudo-knowledge you can draw from any time you feel your beliefs are being challenged.  Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.  The same kinds of “counterfactual communities” arise around any topic that attracts enough general interest. I’ve witnessed this myself over the past decade while looking into war crimes in Syria, Covid-19 disinformation and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Why do counterfactual communities form? A key factor is distrust in mainstream authority. For some, this is partly a reaction to the UK and US government’s fabrications in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Sometimes, it stems from a sense of injustice around the Israel-Palestine conflict. These are of course legitimate positions, and are not by themselves indicative of a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. But a pervasive sense of distrust can make you more vulnerable to slipping down the rabbit hole.  One way of looking at this is that government deception or hypocrisy has caused a form of moral injury. As with the proverb “once bitten, twice shy”, that injury can result in a kneejerk rejection of anyone perceived as being on the side of the establishment.  This creates a problem for traditional approaches to combatting disinformation, such as the top-down factcheck, which might be provided by a mainstream media outlet or some other organisation. More often than not, this will be discredited, dismissed with: “They would say that, wouldn’t they?” Factchecking outfits may do good work, but they are missing a crucial component: the power of the crowd. Because, as well as counterfactual communities, we’ve also seen what you might call truth-seeking communities emerge around specific issues. These are the internet users who want to inform themselves while guarding against manipulation by others, or being misled by their own preconceptions.checking themselves. Once established, they will not only share and propagate factchecks in a way that lends them credibility, but often conduct the process of fact  The Russian MoD’s claim was debunked when social media users realised they had used screenshots from a computer game  What’s important about these communities is that they react quickly to information being put out by various actors, including states. In 2017 the Russian ministry of defence published images on social media that it claimed showed evidence of US forces assisting Islamic State in the Middle East. Huge if true – except it was instantly debunked when social media users realised within seconds that the Russian MoD had used screenshots from a computer game.  I would go as far as to say that internet users who are heavily engaged with particular topics are our strongest defence against disinformation. At Bellingcat, a collective of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists I founded in 2014, we’ve seen this play out in real time during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine helped create a community focused on the conflict there that uses open source techniques to examine, verify and debunk a myriad of information. In the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion, members started gathering videos and photographs of Russian troop movements that forewarned of the planned attack, and proactively debunked disinformation being spread by separatists, including a supposed IED attack posed with bodies that were shown to have already been autopsied before they arrived at the scene.  After the invasion got under way, many of the same people helped collect and geolocate videos and photographs, including images of potential war crimes, that Bellingcat and its partners have been verifying and archiving for possible use in future accountability processes. These contributions, on the face of them disjointed and chaotic, have saved our verification team vast amounts of time.  But how do you grow and nurture what are essentially decentralised, self-organised, ad hoc groups like this? Our approach has been to engage with them, creating links from their useful social media posts to our publications (all thoroughly factchecked by our team), and crediting them for their efforts. We also create guides and case studies so that anyone who is inspired to give it a go themselves has the opportunity to learn how to do it.  But there’s more to do than simply waiting for crowds of investigators to emerge and hoping they’re interested in the same things we are. We must take a broader approach. The answer lies in creating a society that’s not only resilient against disinformation, but has the tools to actively contribute to efforts towards transparency and accountability. For example, digital media literacy charity The Student View has been going into schools and showing 16- to 18-year-olds how to use investigation techniques to look into issues affecting them. In one case, students in Bradford used freedom of information requests to uncover the unusually large number of high speed police chases in their areas.  Teaching young people how to engage positively with issues they face and then expanding this work into online investigation is not only empowering, it gives them skills they can use throughout their lives. This is not about turning every 16- to 18-year-old into a journalist, police officer, or human rights investigator, but giving them tools they can use to contribute, in however small a way, to the fight against disinformation. In their home towns, in conflicts such as Ukraine, and in the wider world – they really can make a difference.

Other politicians are taking her ideas. They all talk like her now.”  Elisabeth left school at 16 and worked at a shoemaker’s, in factories and as a housekeeper, but her €800 pension barely covers bills and food. “I live on credit, overdrawn by the middle of the month,” she said. “I make a weak stew and it lasts me three days. But Le Pen will cut taxes and put money in our pockets.” She agrees with Le Pen’s anti-immigration stance. She feels “Europeans” are becoming outnumbered in multi-ethnic northern Marseille and worries about crime. “I’ve been mugged twice, once for a necklace, once for a cigarette,” she said. Society is tense and divided, she feels, but Le Pen will “calm things down”.  After a decade spent trying to detoxify the jack-booted image of the far-right, anti-immigration party she took over from her father, Le Pen this week reached her highest poll ratings and popularity. Polls show her not only reaching the second round final against the centrist president Emmanuel Macron on 24 April, but significantly closing the gap. An Ifop poll alarmed Macron’s camp by showing her reaching 47% against his 53%, the narrowest margin yet and far closer than when he defeated her with 66% in 2017.  Political opponents still decry Le Pen’s National Rally party as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim, but polls show that, while society once rejected her as the “devil” of the republic, public perception of her has softened. On her third presidential bid, Le Pen, 53, has risen to become the second favourite political personality in France behind Macron’s former prime minister Edouard Philippe in Elabe’s latest monthly survey.  Marine Le Pen has focused her campaign on the cost of living and feelings of social inequality. Photograph: Alain ROBERT/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock  Le Pen’s focus on the cost of living – and the rising energy prices likely to be exacerbated by the war in Ukraine – has allowed her to shrug off her past connections to Vladimir Putin, whom she visited in 2017. “She’s dangerous,” the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said last week. “She could win this presidential election.” On a walkabout in western France, Macron warned against people “looking away” from the reality of her radical programme and “finding her nicer”.  The presidential election campaign has been the most far-right in France’s modern history. In addition to Le Pen, another far-right candidate emerged: the former TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has convictions for inciting racial hatred. Using more inflammatory language than Le Pen, he has anchored the discredited conspiracy theory of the “great replacement” - in which he claims local French populations could be replaced by newcomers, making France a majority Muslim country on the verge of civil war – in mainstream debate. Between them, Le Pen and Zemmour have about 30% of the vote in the first-round polls. Les Républicains on the traditional right, and their struggling candidate, Valérie Pécresse, have ramped up their rhetoric on immigration as they compete with Zemmour.  Instead of damaging Le Pen, Zemmour has strengthened her. “Something quite amazing happened during this campaign. The radicality of Eric Zemmour has softened the image of Marine Le Pen,” said Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist at Sciences-Po university in Paris. “She’s less radical to many voters, she looks less aggressive than Eric Zemmour, she’s got more respectability.”  Election campaign posters for Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour in Montaigu, western France. Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty Images  Le Pen’s hardline manifesto policies have not changed, and overlap with Zemmour’s. She has promised a referendum on immigration and a rewrite of the constitution to ensure “France for the French” — where native French people would be prioritised over non-French people for welfare benefits, housing, jobs and healthcare. The Muslim headscarf, which she calls “a uniform of totalitarian ideology”, would be banned from the streets and all public places.  Le Pen’s key themes – concerns over insecurity and crime, a feeling of decline and social inequality, and her linking those issues to immigration and a percieved threat of Islamism – have taken up more space in the public debate in recent years.  “The ideas we’ve always fought for have become the majority opinion,” said Jordan Bardella, 26, the rising star of the party and its current caretaker leader, as he met voters in Marseille. Queueing to see him, a retired school psychologist from the French Riviera said: “My sister is a doctor, my brother-in-law an architect, we’re not the type of family that used to vote Le Pen, but these days it’s easier to be open about it.”  Jordan Bardella takes a selfie with Le Pen supporters at a March meeting in Cogolin, southern France. Photograph: Alain ROBERT/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock  Raphaël Llorca, a communications consultant at the Fondation Jean Jaurès thinktank and the author of a book on Le Pen and Zemmour, The New Masks of the Far-right, said the tone of Le Pen’s campaign was deliberately different this year.  “In previous campaigns, she was very populist, presenting ‘the people versus the elite’ in a way that was very aggressive and virulent. Her political strategy was to harness all different types of anger,” he said. “Now, her view is that division and conflict won’t work. Her political reading of Macronism is that Emmanuel Macron is a president who has divided people – there have been the [anti-government] gilets jaunes protests, demonstrations over the Covid health pass. She calls him the ‘president of chaos’ and says she can ‘calm’ things. It’s very different. She’s seeking to demobilise the voters who usually turn out to stop her. She wants to anaesthetise society’s reflexes against the far right, neutralise her critics.”  Pollsters still consider a Le Pen presidential win unlikely, but, for the first time, some analysts see it as an outside possibility. Uncertainties remain over the rate of abstention and whether leftwing voters would once again turn out in high numbers to vote for Macron in order to keep her out.  To soften her image, Le Pen often references her love of Bengal cats and recent diploma to become a breeder. “She’s transformed herself into a kindly cat breeder? Lies!” said Macron’s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, at a recent rally, adding that Le Pen had always pushed “a discourse of hate”.

I just sang and looked pretty. Derry [Brownson, sampler], Zac [Foley, bass] and I had the idea for EMF, but we didn’t have much direction. We’d just go to Cinderford village hall and muck about dressing up in jumble sale clothes. I worked in a music shop and had got to know Ian. He was a bit older, part of the Gloucester scene and had experience of writing songs in bands.  We had the name EMF, which stands for Epsom Mad Funkers – which was how David Quantick, writing in NME, had described New Order fans, and we adored New Order – but no songs. We’d sit around Ian’s mum’s piano with this really primitive synthesiser and wrote the 10 songs that ended up on Schubert Dip. I said “I want to be Chicago house, Detroit techno” but Ian pulled us back into crossover indie/dance. Ian had Unbelievable pretty well formed: there’s the tale he tells of the melody coming into his head as he was riding on his bike. I was really inexperienced, and on the original four-track demo, my vocals are even more camp and throwaway than on the single.  We were in our late teens and thought we were invincible. The record labels invited us to London but we got them to come to us to witness the mayhem of this little scene we’d created in the Forest of Dean. People were literally climbing through the pub windows trying to get in to our gigs. Before we knew it, Virgin, Island and EMI were offering us big bucks. We looked to American hip-hop for fashion, and we used our first advance to buy really big dodgy puffer jackets like East 17.  Unbelievable is 30 years old, but it certainly hasn’t gone away. It was used in a terrible advert for Kraft Crumbles – this cheesy pie topping – with the lyrics: “They’re crumbelievable.” We got in a major battle with Asda – who wanted to use it – and finally we said “Yes, but only if you take out the Adsa-price slap on the bottom”, and they gave up. It’s hard to cover because it’s such a slow tempo. The judges tried on The Voice – I nearly choked on my cup of tea when I saw will.i.am trying to do my rap.  I’m still making music – I’m still a West Country raver at heart. I envisaged living off my royalties but 10 or so years ago I retrained as a secondary school teacher. None of the kids I teach have even heard of EMF, but being asked to sign autographs at parents’ evening can get a bit weird.  Ian Dench, guitarist  My mother thought I’d ruined my life because I’d dropped out of studying fine art at Oxford University and I was living in this grotty Gloucester bedsit in the street – as I later discovered – next to Fred West, the serial killer. My previous band, Apple Mosaic, had come to nothing in eight years. I had said to the singer: “Shall we work on some more songs?” and he said: “No, I’ve got to make my girlfriend’s dinner,” and that was it. I went to see my girlfriend at Cardiff University and she dumped me because she thought I was such a loser.  I hitched a lift home and the lorry dropped me on the M50. I remembered this cool kid called James that I’d met at Glos Music Co, who had kept saying: “You should come to the Forest of Dean. We’ve got this great band. We wear Afghan coats and play death metal.” I phoned him from a call box, 10 minutes later he arrived with Zac, we went out and got drunk and I didn’t go home for three days.  ‘We were in our late teens and thought we were invincible’: EMF in 1990 Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images  They had the name – EMF – but no songs, so I said: “We’d better write some.” One day, I was riding my bike home, still obsessed with this girl who had dumped me, and the idea just came to me: “The things you say / Your purple prose just gives you away / The things you say / You’re unbelievable.” My dad was a classical guitarist, so I’d learned classical guitar and also loved the blues. The guitar riff goes from blues mode to flamenco mode, like the two conflicting sides of my life.  Samples were all the rage, and the “Oh” is a sample of this misogynistic US comedian called Andrew Dice Clay that was weirdly released on Def Jam, but we couldn’t get hold of anyone in the Def Jam office to clear it. We were flown out to Los Angeles to meet EMI and I happened to see Rick Rubin, the founder of Def Jam, sitting in the Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset. I asked if he’d clear the sample, he said: “Fax my office in the morning” and he did it for free.  Unbelievable only went to No 3 in the UK although it did go to No 1 in the US. I’m still a songwriter for hire. I co-wrote Beautiful Liar for Beyoncé and Shakira, so finally I’ve had a No 1 here.

Many of the albums and songs to have won the top prizes have been ones that are handsomely, rather than raggedly, made; emotionally forthright but keeping themselves in check. And so it proved at the 2022 ceremony, where strong work of great classiness by Silk Sonic, Jon Batiste and Olivia Rodrigo secured the big prizes.  Silk Sonic’s Leave the Door Open is a very deserved winner of four awards, for record and song of the year, plus R&B performance and R&B song (the latter shared with Jazmine Sullivan, also the rightful winner of R&B album). With its immaculate session musicianship and vocal harmonising, it seems to be in conversation with R&B itself, lampooning the earnest lust of the late 70s and 80s iteration of the genre but not mocking it. There is a kind of sketch comedy detail to the way Anderson Paak makes sure all the bases are covered to seal the romantic deal, proffering fillet steaks and marijuana – but without such sumptuous songwriting it would have risked coming off as a Lonely Island-type parody. These wins mean Paak’s Silk Sonic partner Bruno Mars is now a 14-time winner, and Mars is perhaps the very vision of what the Recording Academy loves: technically brilliant, in tune with history and alive to love and sex without being threateningly erotic.  Jon Batiste is another person who is consciously riffing on musical history, creating a genre-spanning overview of Black American culture with We Are, which won album of the year (he also won four other awards). At times I found this album corny, like a Disney ride around jazz and hip-hop where you have to keep your hands very much inside the car – but there are some affecting moments such as the finely etched memories on Boy Hood, and his ambition, positivity and humanity cast a halo around even the more generic songs.  Olivia Rodrigo’s three wins in her breakout year included best new artist and best pop solo performance for the year’s best power ballad, Drivers License. Like the aforementioned winners, she can really sell a tune, and this isn’t faint praise. There is something actorly about her delivery – even on bedroom-trashing pop-punk songs – but she is so convincingly angry and hurt that she lifts pop into psychodrama, though still in a very family-friendly way (an F-bomb notwithstanding).  You could argue that artists with messier emotions and less contained artistry got shut out, such as Lil Nas X, whose variously waspish and self-lacerating album Montero was as good as pop music gets. Likewise Billie Eilish and her riveting portrait of corroded youth, Happier Than Ever, although perhaps voters consciously heeded her cringe at fame and indeed the very public lens that the Grammys puts its winners under. But Doja Cat, who could have been too purely vivacious for the Academy, thankfully won best pop duo/group performance with her determinedly horny song Kiss Me More featuring SZA. In recent days, she has spoken of wanting to retire – here’s hoping she can find a way to thrive through the chaos of pop, as she has the kind of joie de vivre that makes it worth turning on the radio.  Joie de vivre … Doja Cat and SZA. Photograph: John Locher/Invision/AP  Foo Fighters swept the rock categories, and while this wasn’t a sentimental choice – voting had closed before drummer Taylor Hawkins’ death in March – it did end up feeling apt: Hawkins’ spirited playing was the very essence of the genre. Another deserved winner was Baby Keem, who won the best rap performance alongside Kendrick Lamar: a boisterous 21-year-old memelord whose command of both melody and distinct metre is startling.  Of course, classiness was notably absent in other areas. Some will have been discomfited by Kanye West’s two wins in other rap categories in the wake of an ugly barrage against ex-wife Kim Kardashian and boyfriend Pete Davidson – the post-divorce poignancy of his Grammy-nominated album Donda soured when he brought his anger and confusion outside the music and under the glare of social media. Ultimately, the Donda material is underrated and his winning songs are compelling – Jail’s fanfare of distortion is a wonderfully grand statement (and brings Jay-Z up to 24 wins overall) and Hurricane benefits from one of the Weeknd’s loveliest vocal melodies – and the voting cutoff was before West’s most sustained hounding of Kardashian.  The Academy’s starker ethical failure is in awarding Louis CK with best comedy album. In 2017, CK was accused by numerous women of sexual harassment, and he admitted to the allegations that he had masturbated in front of them. His Sincerely Louis CK comedy special may have its merits, and there is a ruthlessly punitive bent to our culture which denies that people can be rehabilitated and better themselves. But the Grammys carry greater meaning than “this was the best comedy album this year”, while also, in their win-lose binary, stripping out any complexity. Honouring CK ultimately sends the message that sexual harassers need not worry about their misdeeds, as a few years later they’ll be back to the very top of the US cultural tree. It is a bad call in a Grammys year that made a lot of the right ones.

Some of them had their hands tied behind their backs. Beside one murdered woman lay a keychain with a pendant showing the yellow stars on blue background of the European flag. The Ukrainian horrors are clearly far worse than the Hungarian miseries, but the two are fatefully connected.  It is a bitter irony that, just as we learn of some of the worst atrocities in Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war of terror against Ukraine, Putin’s closest ally among EU leaders, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, is re-elected partly because he turned that very war to his own political benefit. As well as exploiting all the advantages he has already built in to a heavily rigged political system, such as gerrymandered constituencies and overwhelming media dominance, Orbán won by telling Hungarians that he would keep them out of this war – and that their heating bills would stay low due to his sweet gas deals with Putin.  In his victory speech, the Hungarian leader listed the “opponents” he had defeated. They included the international media, Brussels bureaucrats and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has criticised him fiercely for his opposition to the weapon supplies and further sanctions that Ukraine desperately needs. So he tells us exactly who his enemies are – and friend Putin has hastened to congratulate him on his famous victory.  If the Hungarian six-party opposition coalition led by Márki-Zay had won, Hungary would have become a staunch western ally in the face of Russian aggression, as other central European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic are proving to be. “Russians go home!” some youngsters chanted at the very end of that disconsolate opposition wake in Budapest, recalling a slogan from the time of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Walking back at midnight across a deserted Heroes Square, I recalled how in that very place in June 1989 I had heard a young, seemingly idealistic Orbán himself call for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. Yet now the ageing cynic is flatly refusing to let western arms supplies pass through Hungary in order to help the Ukrainian army send the Russians home. I wonder what he sees when he looks in the mirror.  An opposition government would also have joined the European public prosecutor’s office, enabling the pursuit of well-documented corruption in the use of EU funds. It would have kicked out the International Investment Bank, which the opposition says is closely linked to the Putin regime. And it would have set about the difficult process of turning Hungary back into a proper liberal democracy.  Instead, Orbán’s Fidesz party has once again secured a two-thirds supermajority, enabling it to change the constitution at will. Whatever honeyed assurances it gives in Brussels or Washington, it will continue to consolidate what political scientists describe as an electoral authoritarian regime. Hungary’s political system is now closer to that of non-EU Serbia, which this weekend saw a simultaneous victory for another nationalist electoral authoritarian, President Aleksandar Vučić, than it is to that of a democracy such as France or Portugal. Orbán and Vučić are close allies.  There were significant failings by the opposition. The six parties were not as united as they should have been, and the lead candidate obviously failed to convince the electorate outside Budapest. Overall, the opposition actually lost votes, although it gained some single-member constituencies in the capital. But there is no way in which this was a fair election.  Wherever I went over the last five days, I saw streets and metro carriages plastered with government-funded posters showing an avuncular image of Viktor Orbán beside the slogan “Let’s protect Hungary’s peace and security”. Another ubiquitous poster showed a young mother and child with the slogan “Protect the children”. This advertised a government referendum conducted at the same time as the election, with questions such as “Do you support the promotion of sex reassignment therapy for underage children?” (The referendum did not reach the required 50% of valid votes.) State media relentlessly promoted a pro-Orbán narrative, as they have done for more than a decade, and even spent some time effectively blaming the war in Ukraine on the Ukrainians. Márki-Zay got just five minutes on state television to explain the opposition programme. Facebook was plastered with regime-supporting paid advertising, thus continuing the platform’s ignoble record of helping the enemies of liberal democracy in return for filthy lucre.  Yet having spent lavishly on tax and welfare handouts to win the election, the Orbán government needs EU funds to fill a big hole in its finances. Unless the EU is prepared simply to accept that it now has an authoritarian member state, it should at long last impose rigorous conditionality on the flows of European money that have long been one of the main founts of Orbán’s power. This means continuing to withhold post-Covid recovery grants and loans, since transparency cannot be guaranteed by a regime that is actually built on the corrupt use of EU money. It also means finally triggering the rule-of-law conditionality mechanism that could hold back significant chunks of funding from the EU’s regular budget. (And not being fooled into giving Hungary lots of money for Ukrainian refugees who have in fact already moved on to other countries.)  But here’s the problem. Faced with the latest evidence of the barbaric behaviour of Russian troops in Ukraine, Europe needs to step up its sanctions against Putin. When Orbán returned from back-to-back summits of Nato and the EU in Brussels last month, his government sent an email to all Hungarians who had signed up for a Covid vaccine saying that “proposals were put on the agenda against which Hungary’s interests had to be protected”. His government would never allow weapons supplies to go through Hungary to Ukraine, nor sanctions to be imposed on the 85% of Hungary’s gas and 64% of its oil that comes from Russia. In response to the Bucha atrocities, EU leaders such as French president Emmanuel Macron are now calling for more sanctions, including on Russian oil. Self-styled “realists” may argue that Brussels has to stay soft on Hungary in order to keep Orbán on board for a common front over Ukraine.  Europe should now get tough on both the Russian enemy without and the Hungarian enemy within. But can it and will it do both at once? Here is another dilemma this dark, depressing weekend has presented to a deeply shaken Europe.

Denials and claims of fabrication out of Moscow are worthless. The alleged massacres in Bucha and elsewhere cannot be put down to the indiscipline of war. After a month of targeted destruction of homes, hospitals and schools, they indicate a systematic campaign of terror against an entire population. They recall the worst depravities of the second world war.  The conflict in Ukraine is mutating from an all-embracing Russian conquest to the strategic exploiting of separatists in Donbas to strengthen Russia’s position on the Black Sea. It has become an escalation of a secessionist war that began in 2014. From that, Nato and the western world have largely, and probably rightly, held aloof.  But how should the outside world react to the new revelations? The suffering of peoples in conflicts far from Europe tends to pale against suffering “on our doorstep”, when screened nightly on television. Afghanistan’s two decades of western intervention have led millions of Afghans to face starvation, largely through western sanctions. Of their agony the news is silent.  That does not make Ukraine’s suffering any less real. This week the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, set up an inquiry to collect evidence of Russian war crimes. These may include breaches of Geneva conventions on the conduct of war, acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. As the international lawyer Philippe Sands has pointed out, “the real issue that prosecutors will face” with regard to these crimes is whether they can “trace responsibility right up to the leadership”. This requires fixing responsibility for frontline behaviour on a superior authority. In Ukraine, it would require evidence that Vladimir Putin ordered or knowingly permitted atrocities. His possible defence – he could not be accountable for the fog of war or the horrors of battle – would have to be rebutted.  The first indictment of a sitting head of state before an international tribunal was Yugoslavia’s Slobodan Milošević in 1999. He was charged with counts emerging from seven massacres. His laborious trial dragged on for six years until in 2006 he died, unconvicted, in prison. By then Yugoslavia had moved on and the trial had lost retributive or deterrent impact. This illustrates Zelenskiy’s difficulty, but should not discourage him from proceeding. The cruelties of war need constant publicising and the west should offer every assistance.  Another judicial route proposed by Sands and others is a tribunal into the crime of aggression in particular. Here the argument is that all actions by soldiers result from decisions by their leaders, including unprovoked aggression against a foreign state. Putin could not wriggle off this hook. His generals, even his seemingly vanished defence secretary, Sergei Shoigu, could argue that they were obeying no orders but his.  Whether at the Nuremberg trials or with the signing of the charter of the United Nations, international action has struggled to outlaw attacks on one sovereign state by another. It concentrates responsibility at the point of authority, be it democratic or authoritarian. It seeks to bring international law and morality to the service of peace. Law-law is better than war-war.  While superficially attractive, such an approach would face uncomfortable hurdles. It would probably require UN security council initiative, which would be vetoed by Russia and possibly China. More to the point, many UN members hardly have clean hands on aggression. Western interventions in Yugoslavia in 1999 and Iraq in 2003 were of dubious legality, as have been other interventions around the world by Nato or its members, however noble the intentions.  Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and other western leaders gaze at the images from Bucha and reflexively agree that something must be done, and the only thing they can think of is “ever tougher sanctions”. Despite being the most savage ever imposed on an economy of comparable size, they have patently failed to dent Putin’s resolve. Admittedly unreliable polls indicate little domestic opposition to him, whether among the Russian people or the Moscow elite. A sense of embattlement and cultural ostracism has seen both groups hunker down in a patriotic trench. Putin’s decisions are governed by battles not sanctions, by tanks not banks. If the west wants to help Ukraine it should do so by proxy, by sending weapons.  History offers scant evidence that decisions taken in the heat of war are governed by economics. The historian Nicholas Mulder finds the US withdrawal of financial support from Britain over Suez in 1956 as one of the few examples of it having any impact on policy. Plenty of sanctions “hurt” – usually poor people – but almost none can be shown to have the slightest bearing on a victim state’s conduct of a conflict. As for driving the price of Europe’s gas, oil and grain through the roof, sanctions may make outsiders “feel Ukraine’s pain”. They will not relieve it, any more than currently traumatising Europe’s political economy for years to come will help a postwar recovery.  We should not ignore the most lasting weapon, the tribunal of world opinion. The pictures of Bucha are being seen on the streets not just of Europe and the US but across the world. Russia’s reputation is being badly damaged. There will come a point when the cries of an outraged world penetrate even Moscow’s mendacious publicity machine and set the record straight. As for Putin, he has merely assured himself of pariah status for life. His yacht will never drop anchor in a western harbour.

In the US and its allies, political leaders, commentators and journalists now portray a monolithic authoritarian bloc bent on extinguishing the rules-based order that has safeguarded peace and democracy for decades.  According to the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, “a new arc of autocracy is instinctively aligning to challenge and reset the world order in their own image.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, characterized the joint communique coming out of the Putin-Xi meeting as aiming to establish “the rule of the strongest [over] the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination, coercion instead of cooperation”.  Such pronouncements casually ignore the deep differences between Russian and Chinese interests, motivations and visions for the global order. By equating Putin and Xi, western leaders risk casting aside possibilities for international cooperation, ushering into being the deep China-Russia alignment they fear already exists and setting the world on a path to far wider geopolitical conflict.  True, the leaders of Russia and China share a common set of security grievances against the US-led bloc, fearing both internal subversion and external limitations on their regional aspirations. Yet while Putin’s goal is merely to obliterate these threats, Xi has articulated an ambitious positive vision for the world that goes beyond the hunger for great power status through regional domination and instead interweaves the interests of the Chinese people with pursuit of the global common good.  The centerpiece of this vision is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a loose framework for a sprawling set of investments, loans, and building projects that have brought hundreds of billions of dollars to the developing world in the form of infrastructure, public health and digital connectivity. These essential investments have been neglected by western investors and development agencies for decades, so they have been avidly welcomed in the global south.  According to the Chinese government, BRI is motivated by the universal right to development and Xi’s slogan of building a “Human Community with a Shared Future”, in which developing countries would gain a greater say in global governance and the international community would guarantee the provision of global public goods like the Covid-19 vaccine. Unsurprisingly, the impetus behind BRI is not humanitarianism but narrower interests: Chinese capital surpluses seeking productive outlets, Chinese firms looking for new markets, and Chinese manufacturers seeking secure supplies of raw materials. Corruption and labor rights violations are common in these projects, and the environmental consequences have sometimes been negative. But Chinese lenders are adapting by establishing higher standards, and “greening the BRI” is now a central priority. While much work is needed to improve the BRI, the coincidence of Chinese interests with those of the developing world is important to recognize – and something that sets it apart from Russia.  China’s global vision in some ways challenges the power of the rich countries and the free-market principles of the liberal international order, but it also holds out the promise of solving some of the most intractable and destabilizing problems facing humanity. Far from imposing a new global order, China is inviting the west to work together on reforming the status quo. On 28 February, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for greater US–China cooperation to increase global access to vaccines, coordinate economic policy and address the climate crisis. Notably, he invited US participation in the BRI and offered to coordinate with the US-led Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative. France has shown the way, recently signing an agreement with China to cooperate on seven infrastructure and green energy projects, most located in Africa, worth more than $1.7bn.  Yet in line with the Manichean democracy v autocracy framework, the US has spurned such overtures and is casting initiatives in the developing world as an either-or choice between the two countries. The Biden administration is positioning B3W as a “high-quality” alternative to the BRI, even though its much lower levels of funding are unlikely to engage in similar projects. Members of the administration continue to denounce Chinese overseas projects as part of a sinister “debt trap” aimed at seizing control over strategic assets – a claim that has been repeatedly debunked. The US Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which easily passed the Senate last year, portrays the BRI as part of a far-reaching attack against both the US and “the future peace, prosperity, and freedom of the international community”. It includes a provision requiring the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a multilateral development bank focusing on Latin America and the Caribbean, to block recipients of its loans from taking out loans from Chinese institutions.  Developing countries will be the first to pay the cost of such an either-or choice, and they are resisting it. Mia Motley, the high-profile prime minister of Barbados, has resisted criticism of economic ties with China by asserting the principle that her country hopes to be “friends of all and satellites of none”, and welcome to any foreign investment that serves the needs of her people. Similarly, Pacific island nations have sought to “avoid entanglement in strategic competition” between the US and China, and south-east Asian countries have viewed new alliances such as the anti-China Aukus (Australia-UK-US) with wariness.  But there are also far more dire and systemic dangers in the US approach. The US vision of zero-sum competition between the BRI and B3W initiatives is just one aspect of an overall strategy aimed at limiting China’s rise. A primary focus of Biden’s foreign policy has been organizing US allies – most of the world’s richest countries – into an economic and military bloc united around this containment strategy.  This encourages China to similarly seek its own economic and military bloc to ensure its continued economic growth and military security. It also strengthens the angry and aggrieved impulses in Chinese politics, fueling China’s own brand of destructive zero-sum nationalism. These are the dynamics that led to the infamous Putin–Xi meeting. Chinese leaders worry that they have no choice but to strengthen the China-Russia relationship because they believe a US-led bloc already seeks to undermine China’s rise, which seems to leave them with two options: face the great powers of the US and Europe alone, or alongside Russia as a fellow great power ally, which in turn escalates China’s tensions with the US and its allies in Europe. If the escalating spiral of confrontation, insecurity, nationalism, and bloc formation continues unchecked, it threatens to unleash a global conflict that will undermine liberal values on both sides even more surely than current fears about the supposed “arc of autocracy”.  But it is not too late to choose a different path. Cooperation between China and the west, coupled with the acceptance of China’s peaceful rise, would increase China’s sense of its options and its willingness to take risks in line with other western priorities. That could include applying pressure to limit Russian aggression. Greater US-China cooperation on infrastructure and other global public goods would both benefit developing countries and point towards a just, sustainable and peaceful alternative to escalating great power rivalry. We should take China’s openness to this seriously.

Raheem Sterling recorded two assists at Burnley but his manager talked less about his creativity than his reliability. “He is a guy who can play every three days,” Guardiola said. “He is never injured. We have not got a massively deep squad so it is important to have players like him, Phil [Foden], Riyad [Mahrez] and Bernardo [Silva], who are never injured.” Guardiola knocked on the wood of a Turf Moor desk as he was speaking but there is statistical proof of his flair players’ toughness. Sterling has played 281 times in under six seasons for him. Only João Cancelo has made more appearances for City than Silva this season. Sterling and Mahrez are tied for fourth, behind the Portuguese pair and the goalkeeper Ederson. Their relentlessness as individuals explains City’s as a team. Richard Jolly  2) Rangnick lets fly with some home truths  After the latest torpid display Ralf Rangnick went further than he has done previously when assessing how long it might be before Manchester United might contend for a 21st title. “It takes right decisions: what kind of manager, what kind of players – and then in every transfer window try to get the best. This is not rocket science. If that happens it does not necessarily need three or four years – maybe two or three transfer windows, then the situation could be different.” The key word here is “could”. United are going backwards at lightning pace and the interim manager’s analysis of the squad illuminates the mess. “We spoke about that counterattacking moment we had where they tackled us twice [which presaged Leicester’s goal] and the same was true in a few other moments. It has to [do with] DNA. It is difficult to change a technically great player into an aggressive player and we have a lot of people who are technical.” Jamie Jackson  Technically great but needing more aggression: Manchester United players Bruno Fernandes, Fred and Anthony Elanga. Photograph: Tim Keeton/Shutterstock  3) Classy Eriksen offers more than a feelgood story  In ordinary circumstances Chelsea’s fans would have been booing the former Tottenham player. Yet rivalry goes out of the window when it comes to Christian Eriksen and it was striking to see the home fans applauding the Dane when he took Brentford’s first corner during their win at Stamford Bridge. It was a reminder that everyone wants Eriksen’s return to go well and while it is natural to worry about the Dane playing again after his cardiac arrest last summer, his ability does not seem to have gone away. There have been no missteps since the 30-year-old’s move to Brentford in January and his performance against Chelsea was proof that he is capable of handling the pace of the Premier League. Chelsea could not cope with Eriksen and his goal to make it 2-1 to Thomas Frank’s side will go down as one of the moments of the season. Jacob Steinberg  4) Marsch’s men learn to slow things down  Jesse Marsch believes in a healthy work-life balance and his Leeds players are rediscovering the benefits of the days off they rarely enjoyed under Marcelo Bielsa. On the pitch the American also preaches balance: between the thrilling intensity of Bielsa’s aggressive high press and the ability to sporadically slow the tempo and control play. “We have a term we call ‘100 to 70,’” said Marsch after Saturday’s 1-1 draw at home to a Southampton side who required one of the impressive James Ward-Prowse’s hallmark free-kicks to earn a point. “It means in certain moments we want the players to slow down a little bit – not always physically, sometimes just in their heads – and have a little bit more poise and control. But when we play at Elland Road the fans don’t want to see 100 to 70, they want to see 100 to 150!” Louise Taylor  5) Sá has been Wolves’ signing of the season  It is not quite awards time but as the remaining games begin to whittle down it is unlikely that anyone will supersede José Sá as Wolves’s signing of the season. There is a strong case for Sá, a £7m arrival on a five-year contract from Olympiakos last summer, being the best value-for-money recruit in the Premier League and his display against Aston Villa, notably repelling their attempts to salvage a point, was typical of his brilliance. Fábio Silva, a £35m record signing, played free of the price tag and João Moutinho, a snip at £5m in 2018, was again authoritative in midfield but Sá, despite conceding a late penalty, ultimately preserved victory in a game that Wolves should have long put to bed.

Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty Images  6) Ruthless Jota exceeds expectations  Diogo Jota, displaying his versatility by starting on the left of Liverpool’s attack against Watford, had barely had a touch when he showed the high-class movement and predatory instinct that Joe Gomez’s cross deserved to head his team in front at Anfield. It was the 20th goal in all competitions this season from the Portugal international who, thanks to VAR, also won the penalty that enabled Fabinho to seal a 10th successive Premier League win. Jota has emerged as a decisive influence for Jürgen Klopp’s team and, his manager admitted, has been a better player than Liverpool expected when paying Wolves an initial £41m in September 2020. Klopp said: “At Wolves he had a different job and he did that job so good that we thought, ‘We want him.’ And since he came, he improved a lot. That is a little to do with his age, he is growing into the top, world-class striker role step by step. He is the player we thought he would be and also a little bit better.” Andy Hunter  7) Foxes fail to push on from FA Cup win  In August, Leicester looked in great shape, having won the FA Cup and added Patson Daka and Boubakary Soumaré to a squad already bursting with quality. But in April, they sit ninth in the table and the sense is of a season wasted. On Thursday, they entertain PSV Eindhoven in a Conference League quarter-final – but the reality remains that whatever happens there, domestically they are no better off than they were a year ago. The extent to which they’ve been hampered by injuries cannot be underestimated – and how pleasing it is to see Wesley Fofana feeling his way back – but football being football, Brendan Rodgers is under pressure. What he must do now is decide who he wants in his starting XI next August, then use the remaining games of this season to groove the side, shape and style that will keep him his job. Daniel Harris  8) Kulusevski proving the perfect pick  When Spurs lost at Manchester United, their top-four hopes looked fanciful – not because they were out of the race, but because they didn’t look good enough, loose at the back and creatively constipated. But they have improved markedly in the three games since then, beating Brighton, West Ham and Newcastle in convincing fashion. Though the most eye-catching aspect of Sunday’s triumph was the second-half performance of Harry Kane, England’s Shearer-Sheringham partnership in one player and the contribution of Dejan Kulusevski was equally crucial. It’s early days, but already he looks perfect for Antonio Conte and the Premier League, a physical brute brimming with the energy, bravery and drive necessary to exploit a decent touch and sharp brain. He still has plenty of improving to do, but at 21 there is plenty of time in which he can do it – especially with Kane both setting him away and attacking his crosses. Daniel Harris  Michail Antonio battles with Michael Keane. Photograph: Elli Birch/IPS/Shutterstock  9) Underrated Antonio delivers again  Michail Antonio is so habitually excellent that there’s a danger he is perhaps taken for granted. He’s only scored once in his last 15 appearances for West Ham, and there has been perhaps a sense that fatigue has begun to sap at him as the lack of a replacement means he effectively has to play every week, but he led the line superbly on Sunday. Michael Keane’s second yellow card looked stupid – was stupid – but it was the result of the way Antonio had dragged hm this way and that, overwhelming him both physically and with his movement, never giving him a moment of peace. It was his run and shot that led to Jarrod Bowen’s winner and as well as his three shots, he also completed three key passes. The goals will return, but even without them, Antonio is a vital presence in this West Ham side. Jonathan Wilson  10) Maupay reception a bright spot at Amex  Fans assuming that purchasing a ticket entitles them to shout whatever they want at whoever they want – behaviour that also infects what passes for contemporary public discourse – is one of the worst things about football. There were not many bright spots at the Amex – Norwich look as doomed as they’ve always done, Brighton were as profligate as they always are – but the response to Neal Maupay’s substitution was one. Maupay departed the pitch having missed three good chances and a penalty, so the home fans – who’ve not seen a goal, never mind a win, since the middle of January – might have sent him off with some choice invective. But instead they consoled their player with the ovation he needed to hear, a nice moment on an otherwise miserable afternoon. Daniel Harris

The old adage about weather in March has been a perfect description of Marseille’s form and their chances of qualifying for the Champions League over the last month.  Marseille were floundering at the end of February. What had looked like an iron grip on a Champions League place suddenly seemed uncertain after home defeats to Clermont and Monaco, as well as a draw against a Troyes side who have not exactly set the league alight this season. There was also a heavy loss to Nice in the Coupe de France quarter-finals, a result that was galling not only for its margin – 4-1 at the Allianz Riviera – but also for the fact that Nice had eliminated PSG, clearing the path for an unlikely winner in the competition.  They looked sharper by the middle of March, beating Brest 4-1 away and then turning in a fine display to beat Nice 2-1 in their league meeting. But, with a host of key players coming back from a busy international break, their trip north to play Saint-Étienne this weekend looked like a dangerous fixture.  Sainté have been enjoying a mini-revival under Pascal Dupraz. Having lost just once, to PSG, in their previous eight matches, they were a threat. The game was delayed due to some lion-like weather. An unseasonable snowstorm descended on the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard and led to the game being pushed back from Saturday evening to Sunday afternoon.  Arkadiusz Milik, who has been in imperious form for Marseille, scoring 12 goals already in 2022, was ruled out after picking up an injury on international duty. He will be back soon – perhaps even for the first leg of their Conference League quarter-final against PAOK on Thursday – but, given the struggles of other players to find the net, he looked to be a crucial miss.  Off the pitch, Milik’s clashes with Jorge Sampaoli have been the stuff of legend, the Pole being particularly incensed by the arrival of Cédric Bakambu in January. But the two seemed to have reached an agreement, however tenuous. With four goals in five matches in March, his form has picked up, perhaps even spurred on by the arrival of another striker in Bakambu.  Arkadiusz Milik appears to have been spurred on by his clashes with Sampaoli. Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters  Marseille were also without the suspended Luan Peres. The Brazilian is diligent at the back and provides much of the cover necessary to give Dimitri Payet freedom in attack. In his absence, Sead Kolasinac started at left-back and spent the first 45 minutes being tortured by Denis Bouanga. The former Arsenal man was partly at fault for the opening goal, though the Marseille keeper Pau López had a shocker, letting Bouanga’s weak shot trickle below his body and into the net.  Payet equalised from the penalty spot, and Sampaoli changed things at half-time – replacing Kolasinac with winger Cengiz Ünder and going to a back three. The visitors went on to win 4-2 thanks to a shocking own goal from Lucas Gourna-Douaths, another penalty from Bamba Dieng and a slotted finish from Amine Harit.  The game was closer than the result suggests, but the visitors showed an adaptability that has eluded them previously. Earlier in the season, Marseille exuded an almost manic energy, attacking hell for leather but coming unstuck at times, including a memorable 3-2 defeat at home to Lens. After that defeat, the team became more prosaic and picked up a series of clean sheets in November and December. They have shown flashes of their old exuberance since – including a 5-2 win over Angers in early February – but by and large, Sampaoli has kept his team on a shorter leash in the last few months. They have even looked listless at times.  Marseille were hardly the stuff of dreams defensively against Sainté but, after veering from one extreme to the other, Sampaoli seems to have finally gotten things right. This team has the talent to react and be flexible during a game, something their fellow top-three contenders do not. In Boubacar Kamara, Valentin Rongier, Guendouzi and even William Saliba, Sampaoli has players who can play in multiple positions, allowing him to make tactical shifts when it’s apparent that a given approach – for example, playing Kolasinac at left-back – is not working.  The other three contenders for the Champions League places – Rennes, Strasbourg and Nice – all have their own weaknesses. Rennes are thin defensively and would be in trouble if Nayef Aguerd or Hamari Traoré picked up an injury. Strasbourg lack depth in terms of creativity – witness their recent struggles while Adrien Thomasson has been injured. And Nice, while better organised than the other two, are also far less flexible. Christophe Galtier is a superb coach, but of late he has rarely deviated from his preferred 4-4-2.  Just over a year into his reign, Sampaoli seems to have realised how to maximise his squad’s talent. There are doubts lingering over the team’s future – a looming transfer ban, and the loan returns of Harit, Saliba and Ünder – but with Dimitri Payet’s contract looking like less of an albatross, and Milik, Maxime López and Guendouzi having agreed to make their loan deals permanent, fans have reasons to be optimistic.

Thank you for your feedback.  Talking points  PSG silenced some criticism as they ran out 5-1 winners against Lorient. The visitors, normally so well organised under Christophe Pelissier, were torn to ribbons by the front three of Kylian Mbappé, Neymar and Lionel Messi. The Frenchman scored a double and set up the other three goals – two for Neymar and one for Messi. If this is PSG’s reaction to having “nothing to play for,” it will make their matches more entertaining for neutrals in the next two months.  Kylian Mbappé scored twice for PSG in their 5-1 win over Lorient. Photograph: John Berry/Getty Images  Lyon looked likely to drop more points at home against Angers on Sunday. Missing Karl Toko Ekambi through illness and the brilliant young midfielder Maxence Caqueret to injury, they were pegged back twice and seemed to be heading for another disappointing draw. Enter Tetê – the Brazilian winger signed from Shakhtar Donetsk on a short-term deal on Friday. He needed just 134 seconds to score the winner. Lyon are unlikely to challenge Rennes and Marseille for the Champions League places but Tetê gives them another attacking option, which they have lacked this season. On this evidence, he could be the difference when it comes to advancing in Europe – they play West Ham in the Europa League quarter-finals this week – or securing a top six-finish in the league.  Strasbourg lack the resources of the other clubs vying for the top three but, as they showed this weekend while beating Lens, it’s all about the results. They have struggled to score lately without the injured Adrien Thomasson, drawing against Reims and Lorient, but they showed a combative side against Lens and recorded a vital 1-0 win, taking them above Nice in the table on goal difference. With Lyon to come at the weekend, Julien Stéphan’s team still have plenty to play for this season. Their run-in will be worth watching.

It was something that RB Leipzig’s Domenico Tedesco was keen to pre-warn his young side about – although as he later pointed out in an ESPN interview, it was something the home players were not used to experiencing recently either.  The bitter disappointment for most of those in Westfalen on Saturday evening was that while the colour returned to the stands, it was the same old, same old on the pitch. Leipzig coasted to a 4-1 victory after a testing initial 20 minutes, and Tedesco was happy to explain just how his midfield and forwards were able to surge unperturbed towards a prone BVB defence.  Tedesco has brought gloom to this arena before – he was the Schalke coach when they recovered from a 4-0 half-time deficit to take home a point in a memorable Revierderby in November 2017 which accelerated the fall of the then-Dortmund head coach, Peter Bosz. That, though, was different, a shocking punch to the gut. This felt sadly inevitable.  The last time BVB lost two Bundesliga games by a three-goal margin at home in the same season was in 1990-91, when they finished 10th. They have now lost two games by that distance in this calendar year – both at home and both against rivals, in Leverkusen and now Leipzig. Both the visitors could have scored more. Rarely can a team so assured of second place – even now, with a reduced six-point cushion, the runners-up spot will be theirs barring a quite extraordinary collapse – so frequently underwhelm.  Konrad Laimer celebrates after scoring RB Leipzig’s first goal. Photograph: Leon Kügeler/Reuters  “I think we played a good first half,” Manuel Akanji said after the game. “Except for the goals we gave them.” That is a pretty big caveat, but one that sums up Dortmund’s season. We know they are capable of the sublime, but there are far too many individual moments and far too little group cohesion – as has been the case for a while. The same returning fans who gave their players “goosebumps” (in Akanji’s words) with their vociferous support booed in some areas of the stadium, and there were even a smattering of chants for Marco Rose to go.  The former Gladbach coach will probably get his second season, with a huge injury list and an unevenly built squad not doing him any favours. Instead it will be the job of the incoming sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, to implement what appears more and more likely to be a sweeping programme of reform. That includes rebuilding the defence around the incoming Niklas Süle and getting rid of the increasingly labouring old heads such as Marco Reus and Mats Hummels, alongside whom Kehl played.  That this latest undressing was in front of a full house hurt, but that it was administered by Leipzig was even worse for Westfalen. It would be unfair to say the rest of the Bundesliga’s supporters have forgotten where Leipzig have come from, or even that they have come close to accepting them – but distaste for the model is at least as strong in Dortmund as it is anywhere else.  The protests – and some less savoury behaviour around the ground – on Leipzig’s first visit in 2017 landed BVB with a huge fine and partial stadium closure. The banner in the Südtribune on Sunday which proclaimed “Trotz Pandemie bleibt ihr die größte Seuche der liga” – despite the pandemic, you remain the biggest plague in the league – underlined the fact that those feelings remain.  If the flashing warning signs are not heeded by those at the Dortmund helm, those fans might have to get used to a more permanent reordering of the hierarchy seeking to tug at Bayern’s coattails.

Thank you for your feedback.  Talking points  It was all about the substitutes in the Black Forest as Bayern Munich won 4-1, with the perennial super-sub Nils Pedersen initially equalising for Freiburg 17 seconds after coming on, before Serge Gnabry regained Bayern’s lead 33 seconds after his own entrance. The big news was the change that (initially) didn’t happen, though. After a double substitution by the visitors involved two going on but only one coming off, Freiburg’s Nico Schlotterbeck informed the referee, Christian Dingert, that Bayern had 12 men on the pitch for some 20 seconds. “If I didn’t tell him, I don’t think he sees it at all,” the young Germany centre-back said.  The confusion was caused by an error on the Bayern bench, with Kingsley Coman supposed to be withdrawn but 29 – the winger’s old number – raised rather than his current No 11. The game was then held up for eight minutes with Bayern already leading 3-1 as Dingert, his assistants and VAR verified exactly what had happened. The picture was further obscured by Corentin Tolisso – the only one of the two intended players who actually had gone off – nipping to the toilet, according to Julian Nagelsmann. His opposite number Christian Streich played down the suggestion that Freiburg might appeal to have the game replayed. After all, who would want to play Bayern more times than they had to?

The locals got what they came for, not just in terms of the communal experience but on the pitch too, with Taiwo Awoniyi snaffling up an errant Jonas Hector backpass to score the decider and become Union’s top Bundesliga scorer of all time. “We’re now at 41 points,” said the coach, Urs Fischer, who might tentatively start to look up towards another European qualification. “It’s a joyful evening,”  At the bottom, Arminia Bielefeld leapfrogged Hertha – who paid for a slow start in a 2-1 reverse at Leverkusen – into the relegation playoff spot by snatching a 1-1 draw with Stuttgart in the weekend’s big basement battle. Florian Krüger’s smart back-post finish earned a point after the visitors had led via Sasa Kalajdzic and missed a host of chances to extend their lead. “It’s two points dropped,” lamented Stuttgart’s coach, Pellegrino Matarazzo, though he emphasised that the health of Arminia’s Fabian Klos was the main thing. Klos sustained a “serious head injury”, per the club, in a stoppage-time collision with his own teammate, Alessandro Schöpf. Arminia’s all-time top scorer with 148 goals, Klos is leaving the club in the summer and is out “indefinitely”.  Stuttgart are just a point above Arminia and still very much in danger, despite taking as many points as Bayern from their past four games. Augsburg leapt forward after Iago’s first-minute strike paved the way for a 3-0 win against Wolfsburg, who are wobbling five points above the drop zone after three successive defeats. Another busy performance from Yann Sommer saved Borussia Mönchengladbach from defeat at home against Mainz, and they now seem to have just enough to not be drawn into the scrap.

Inflation there hit 4.5% in March, and while this was up from February’s 3.6%, it remains one of the lowest rates in the industrialised west and well below the UK’s 6.2%, Germany’s 7.3%, Spain’s 9.8% and 11.9% in the Netherlands. A decision last year to limit the amount by which France’s largely state-owned energy companies could raise prices has benefited consumers and taken some of the inflationary pressure off industries that depend on gas and electricity.  In France, where about two-thirds of power comes from Électricité de France’s nuclear plants, the electricity component of inflation has risen by 4% in the past 12 months, but by an average of more than 27% in the eurozone generally.  Yet, in the first round of the presidential election next Sunday, Macron will face criticism from left and right for rocketing diesel prices, which hit the rural poor, and for his attempts over the previous five years to end decades of low growth with a string of pro-business policies.  Recent outrage over his €2.4bn spending on consultants since coming to office is another headline-grabbing issue drowning out his impressive economic record and denting his lead in the polls.  By most economic yardsticks – national income, business investment, consumer spending, labour supply and rising prices – France sits at or near the top of the pile of rich nations. Contrary to most forecasts, its economy recovered last year to 1% above pre-pandemic levels. The UK is still 0.1% below.  Business investment is up in France but down in the UK. Labour shortages there are restricted to discrete corners of the economy, thanks to the expansion of a German-style apprenticeship scheme that the British government promised, but has yet to deliver.  UBS economist Felix Huefner said: “The exceptional performance of the labour market has been a huge surprise.”  Better financial support meant French people ‘continued buying big-ticket items when people in other countries stopped’ Daniela Ordonez, economist  More people are working in France than before the pandemic, whereas in the UK, about 500,000 people, mostly over- 50s, have quit the labour market, making shortages more acute.  Daniela Ordonez at Oxford Economics credits better-funded and targeted financial support: “It meant French people continued buying big-ticket items when other countries stopped.”  The performance gap may appear small – the number of people working or seeking work is 1% higher in France than in 2019 (and 1.5% lower in the UK). But Huefner says an increase in worker numbers through the pandemic helped keep French wages in check – and business costs down.  Philippe Aghion of Insead business school in Fontainebleau says 1.2m jobs were created between 2017 and 2021, “and not just any jobs – the proportion of long-term, long-tenure jobs has increased.”  Temporary contracts, especially for younger workers, were common after almost two decades of restrictive employment laws – not least the 35-hour week, which dates from February 2000. Temp agency workers, contractors and interns became as common in France as in the UK, as firms tried to sidestep the costs of permanent employment.  Aghion was one of Macron’s three economic advisers when he first ran for the presidency. He says the president’s cap on employment tribunal costs was a game-changer, giving big companies an incentive to hire more full-time workers.  Reforms of apprenticeships and training were another seismic boost, he says: “In France, we used to be very top-down, but these days we are more bottom-up, allowing workers to negotiate solutions with firms. Training is no longer decided by unions; workers choose what to do, as they do in Germany.”  Speaking to the Observer last week, Cédric O, France’s secretary of state for the digital economy and a close Macron ally, said the president’s reforms of tax and employment laws, and his understanding of the concerns of small firms, played an important part: “He understands and believes in entrepreneurs. Now we’re halfway to creating the business ecosystem we need.”  Ordonez worries that much of the money Macron spent during the pandemic has pushed the national debt from below 100% to 115% of national income in two years.  At the beginning of this year, Bank of France governor François Villeroy de Galhau warned election candidates that proposals for tax cuts and new spending were unaffordable: “We cannot allow our public finances to deteriorate further.”  Macron has already committed more than €60bn to a recovery fund, alongside €40bn from the EU, to provide the backbone of public investment over the next two years.  But Ordonez is among many who argue that, so far, Macron’s government has distributed borrowed funds wisely. “The money is being spent to restructure the economy and liberate companies from historically high taxes,” she says.  “Higher investment and job creation will pay dividends.”

Hiiumaa island, Estonia. Islands can provide refuges for species that struggle elsewhere. Photograph: Marjorie Botanique/Alamy  Along a straight, ice-free stream, he clambers over fallen trunks, his boots sinking into the powder snow. A glorified chicken coop comes into view, one of the three sites where Maran’s team regularly released European minks between 2000 and 2016. Pregnant females were placed in the cages in May, allowing the mink and her brood plenty of time to adapt to the smells and the sounds of the forest before the doors swung open in August.  Hiiumaa is Estonia’s second-largest island. Its natural borders, surrounded by the Baltic Sea, sparse population and limited surface area – it is just 989 sq km – make it a place with enough potential for the reintroduction of the European mink, which had been locally extinct in Estonia since the mid-1990s.  At one time, the European mink (Mustela lutreola), a small semiaquatic predator that belongs to the family of weasels, otters and martens, was found almost everywhere in Europe, from the eastern foothills of the Urals to northern Spain, from Finland to the Caucasus. But its downfall in large swaths of Europe started centuries ago.  American minks spread fast. Active management is the only way for the European mink to survive Madis Põdra, biologist  Scientists struggle to pinpoint one cause of its demise. More likely, a confluence of circumstances pushed the species towards the abyss, all of them driven by humans. The wetlands in which minks thrived were drained, rivers were straightened, their habitats poisoned. And their furs ended up in wardrobes all over the continent.  The final blow came with the farming of their distant cousins from across the water, the American mink. The animals regularly escaped the industrial-sized farms – or activists opened their cages. In the Soviet Union, scientists released American minks intentionally into the wild, with the idea that they would enrich the fauna. Similar in appearance but not closely related, the two species target the same ecological niche. But the European mink is no match for its shrewd, more flexible and aggressive American counterpart. The American mink drove the European mink to inferior habitats where it found less food and failed to reproduce successfully.  A European (left) and American mink. Since its introduction to the continent, the American mink has driven the European to inferior habitats. Composite: Tiit Maran and Blickwinkel/Alamy  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers the European mink one of the most endangered carnivores in Europe. Within the EU, the animal survives in small numbers in Spain, France, Romania and Estonia. The American mink, on the other hand, thrives in about 20 European countries.  Ecologists continue to protect the remaining habitats of the European mink from dangerous invaders. In Spain, where the European mink occurs in Basque country, Navarre, and La Rioja, government agency Tragsatec traps American minks that enter the habitat of the European.  Without these measures, says Madis Põdra, an Estonian biologist living in Spain, the European mink would already be locally extinct. “American minks spread fast. Active management is the only way for the European mink to survive.”  Tiit Maran, director of Tallinn zoo and a European mink biologist. Photograph: Tom Peeters  At Tallinn zoo, biologists are monitoring the gene pool of the European mink. The breeding facility is currently sealed off as Covid-19 can have disastrous consequences for minks – more than half of Europe’s captive minks live in Tallinn and an outbreak would be catastrophic. “We’d lose the backbone of our conservation work,” says Maran.  When the animal disappeared from the Estonian wilderness, Maran plotted to repopulate Hiiumaa with captive-born European minks. Trappers first eliminated the American minks that had escaped from a now defunct fur farm on the island and, in 2000, Maran’s team released the first batch of European minks.  The reintroduction did not go smoothly. Most males born in captivity showed no interest in mating, even behaving aggressively towards their partners. “In certain years, 80% of males failed to produce offspring,” Maran says. “With every male that does not contribute to the next generation, genetic diversity gets lost.”  More than 500 released minks later, the population has finally stabilised. Currently, between 160 and 250 minks populate Hiiumaa in autumn, a number that dwindles to less than half after winter.  The population of minks on the island has finally stabilised since the first release in 2000. Photograph: Tiit Maran  Islands such as Hiiumaa are typically vulnerable habitats for threatened species. Small populations are acutely sensitive to extinction – environmental disasters, forestry and agriculture or an exceptional winter can have detrimental effects.  But islands, besides being centres of extinction, can also become beacons of hope, refuges for species that struggle elsewhere.  Maran mentions his former teacher in Moscow, who in the 1980s released minks on the Kuril Islands, a Russian archipelago in the far east. “Those populations still survive 40 years later,” he says. Nature reserves delimited by industry or mountains can also act as islands.  Young European mink. More than half of Europe’s captive minks live in Tallinn. Photograph: Tiit Maran  This summer, Maran’s team plans to release minks on Saaremaa, Estonia’s largest island. “It’s not very smart to keep your eggs in one basket,” he says. “Two baskets, in combination with breeding at the zoo, will better ensure the future of the European mink.”  Although no longer regularly working in the field, Maran tries to enhance the mink’s survival chances by educating people at the zoo. Environmental protection, he says, can be divided into two timeframes – short- and long-term.  “The reintroduction of the mink is a short-term thing, even though I have devoted my whole life to it. But if we as humans don’t change, then it has all been useless in the end.”  Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features

Talks on the final draft of the latest comprehensive assessment of climate science, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stretched hours past their deadline on Sunday.  Scientists and governments were locked in disagreement on questions such as how much funding was likely to be needed for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis, and what emphasis to give policies such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.  Governments have been accused of trying to water down the scientists’ findings, originally due to be published early on Monday but – after delays and disagreements on Sunday – postponed by six hours to later the same day.  The Guardian understands that India has demanded key changes on issues including finance, along with Saudi Arabia which wants to see affirmation of a continued role for fossil fuels, while other countries including China and Ecuador also held out on some points. Russia has played a more muted role than some feared.  Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate the Tyndall Centre for climate research at the University of Manchester, one of the UK’s leading climate academics, called for the scientists to prevail.  “I hope Working Group 3 [the IPCC section about to be published] has the courage to actually call for the elimination of fossil fuels production and use within a Paris [agreement] compliant timeline,” he said.  This is the third part of the IPCC’s latest landmark assessment, and the most contentious because it covers the policies, technologies and finances needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  The first part, covering the physical science of climate change, was published last August showing the world had only a narrow chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C; the second, published just over a month ago, showed the catastrophic impacts heating of 1.5C would have, but it was overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The report itself – hundreds of pages long and drawing on the work of thousands of scientists over the past eight years – is settled, but still in dispute is the crucial “summary for policymakers”, a selection of key messages running to only about 40 pages.  While the report is drafted by scientists, the summary – which is the key reference document for governments – is edited with input from every UN member state that wishes to be represented.  The latest warning from the IPCC – the final instalment of its mammoth comprehensive assessment, before a synthesis report in October draws together its key messages in time for governments meeting for the UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt this November – comes at a crucial time.  Many countries, including the US, the EU and the UK, are reconsidering their reliance on fossil fuels in light of the Ukraine war, which has pushed already high energy prices to record levels. Energy is now seen as a national security issue, and the crisis in the cost of living in many countries is forcing governments to rethink ways to protect their citizens, from high prices and climate breakdown.  Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, said: “We are at a moment of increasing tension around the world, with every excuse possible for distraction and delay. We now have to put our arms round a new form of energy security, one that embraces everyone – a new kind of politics. We are at a moment of reckoning and the IPCC report just puts an exclamation point at the end of that.”  Some governments are likely to stress the role the IPCC foresees for techniques that remove carbon from the air, such as carbon capture and storage, used to neutralise fossil fuel power stations, and technologies such as “direct air capture” by which carbon is chemically extracted from the atmosphere.  The IPCC in its broader report is likely to warn that these techniques are unproven and likely to be prohibitively expensive to use quickly at the scale required, but governments may force more favourable language into the summary.  Nikki Reisch, the director of the energy and climate programme at the Center for International Environmental Law, said governments should be clear: “There is no room for more oil and gas full stop. [Some businesses] want to perpetuate the myth that we can carry on using fossil fuels. But we need a just transition away from fossil fuels, not techno-fixes.”  Anderson said this was a key dilemma. He warned the report could “pull its punches, hiding behind billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide removal … [If that is what emerges], then the academic community will have abdicated its responsibility and opted for realpolitik over real physics. The climate responds only to the second.”  Stephen Cornelius, the head of delegation for WWF, defended the IPCC process against charges that governments could use it to water down scientific warnings. He said that as governments played a role in writing the summaries, they could not shirk responsibility for heeding the warnings they contain.  “The IPCC is a useful process,” he said. “It is cumbersome, there is a long time between the outlines and the report, but … the reports have political buy-in, and that’s why they are taken seriously.”

Pure white cotton material is draped over her shoulder, the only thing to set her Driza-bone apart against the brown backdrop. With a flourish, she lays it down, painting the fabric with the mud that helped grow it.  The slow-fashion advocate plans to convert the farm-grown cotton material into a dress to wear and tell a story about the place where it came from: Keytah Farm, the carbon positive farming operation owned by Sundown Pastoral.    “A lot of farmers naturally are cautious about opening the doors and part of that is they can be subject to criticism,” Milburn says.  “But I think transparency and shining light and showing the good things they are doing here is important.”  Just 100 metres away, more artists take shelter from the rain under a row of grain silos while they paint the landscape.    Leo Robba is among them. He’s a lecturer at Western Sydney University and at the helm of the pilgrimage of city artists who travel west each year.  The visit is part of The Painted River Project, combining creativity and science to highlight the importance of healthy waterways.  The project started at Parramatta in western Sydney in 2017, and extended to the Moree region in 2021 through a collaboration between Western Sydney University and the Bank Art Museum Moree (Bamm).  According to Robba, the artists come not just to create but to contribute to and understand the carbon conversation.  “As climate change kicks in, people become more aware,” he says.    “It’s important that city people get a different understanding of how country people live and where their food comes from, how it’s grown, how we could work together to understand each other’s perspectives and work for a collective approach around that.”  Licence to farm  The Keytah Farm manager, Nick Gillingham, doesn’t mind the company the project generates and the chance to gain direct feedback from the consumer.  “It puts back to us how we need to make sure we do the right thing to maintain our licence to farm in the public sector,” he says.  “We need to keep pressing on and try and do the best job we can and improve on what we are doing.”  The operation uses sustainable farming practices, including minimal soil disturbance, incorporating stubble and reducing usage of fertiliser, and according to Sundown Pastoral it’s made water efficiency improvements of up 235%.  In 2019, the 65,000-acre (260 sq km) cropping property underwent a carbon emissions audit that found the production of cotton and other crops on the property reduced carbon emissions.  “We were one of the first farms to do a really thorough study. We compared from 2013 to 2018 – we’d increased our levels in that time, and hopefully in the next few years will be on the up and up,” Gillingam says.  Moree artist Nick Osmond works on his colourful figurative piece in an empty shed on Keytah Farm. Photograph: Lauren Marer  Consumer responsibility  According to Robba, the view that farmers are wasting water is simplistic.  “They are running businesses, so it is in their own interest to be responsible,” he says.  Many in the broadacre farming sector are now using minimal soil disturbance practices and slowly building the health of the soil to increase yields, but Gillingham says sustainable decisions are still motivated by consumer demand and “at the forefront of every political talk”.  In a pre-budget announcement, the federal government recently offered tax cuts to farmers and landholders receiving revenue from the production of Australian carbon credits, to encourage more participation in carbon offset projects and practices.  But as Milburn walks back to the grain shed with her mud-dipped masterpiece, she speaks of her own responsibilities as a consumer in the farming supply chain to make more sustainable choices.  “It is actually how we as wearers use the cotton, so if we wear it for longer until it wears out, then really there is no issue because we need to wear something,” she says.  In the next shed, Moree artist Nick Osmond has been sitting on a chair looking out at the rain to inspire his colourful figurative piece on paper.  While the presence of the artists on the farm is a juxtaposition, Osmond’s self-reflection would have you thinking he could be a farmer.  “You do get set in your ways, you really do. You should be continually looking for different aspects of your work,” he says.  Bamm recently held an exhibition of work completed as part of The Painted River Project 2021.

Vucic scored an outright victory in Sunday’s presidential election with the backing of 60% of the voters, while his Serbian Progressive party (SNS) gained 43% of ballots in parliamentary elections, according to a near complete tally by state election authorities.  The results mean no runoff vote is needed in the presidential election and that Vučić’s party will be able to form the next government in a coalition with junior partners in the 250-member assembly.  The main opposition group, United Serbia, trailed the SNS in the parliamentary elections with 13% of the votes. The group’s presidential candidate, Zdravko Ponoš, gained 17%.  Despite being so far behind nationally, opposition groups appeared to be in a tight race with the populists in the capital, Belgrade, where ballots were still being counted.  The opposition and independent observers listed a series of irregularities and incidents around the vote, including violence. The populists denied vote manipulation or pressuring voters.  Since the SNS came to power in 2012, Vučić has gradually clamped down on mainstream media and institutions, assuming complete control. A former ultranationalist, Vučić has served as defence minister, prime minister and president.  Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Vučić, saying that the outcome confirmed a “broad public support” for his independent foreign policies. The Russian leader voiced hope that Vučić’s activities would help further strengthen the “strategic partnership” between Russia and Serbia.  Portraying himself as a guarantor of peace and stability amid the war in Ukraine, Vučić has refused to join western sanctions against Russia despite formally seeking membership of the EU for Serbia.  After declaring victory on Sunday evening, he said the new government would face tough decisions but would seek to maintain friendly relations with Russia, a historically close ally.  Most of the parties running in the election were right-leaning, reflecting the predominantly conservative sentiments among Serbia’s 6.5 million voters. For the first time, however, a green-left coalition made it into the parliament, signalling rising public interest in neglected environmental problems in the country.  Turnout was nearly 60%, which was higher than recent votes.

Defending earlier comments that described revelations about the parties as “fluff”, the Brexit opportunities minister said a more fundamental issue to be discussed was whether the Covid rules in place at the time were too rigid.  Taking part in a phone-in show on LBC radio, Rees-Mogg declined a caller’s request to apologise for calling the party claims “fluff” now that the Metropolitan police had issued fines to some people who attended the lockdown gatherings.  “We have a war going on in Ukraine, we have atrocities being carried out, we have pictures coming through that show the enormous brutality of Putin’s army,” Rees-Mogg said. “And what I was saying was, in the context of what is going on, not just with Ukraine but with the cost of living crisis, this is not the most important issue in the world. Having said that, people should obviously obey the law.”  Those fined reportedly include the government’s former ethics chief Helen MacNamara. According to the Telegraph, she was fined £50 for attending a leaving event in the Cabinet Office in June 2020.  Separately, sources told the Guardian that Downing Street staff have been issued with fines by over a party that took place the night before Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.  Even though fines had been issued, Johnson had not misled parliament when he said no rules were broken, as he was simply passing on information he had been given, Rees-Mogg said.  “The fact that the prime minister was given wrong information doesn’t mean he misled people. The prime minister said that he was told that the rules were followed, but that turns out not to be correct. We know that fines have now been issued. But the prime minister can only work on the information he’s given.  “If the prime minister is told information that is incorrect, and passes that information on, he has made no deliberate effort to mislead anybody.”  Calling his earlier comments “completely reasonable”, Rees-Mogg appeared to suggest a more important issue would be for a future Covid inquiry to look into whether the rules imposed on people’s lives were overly tough.  “I don’t think the issue of what may or may not have happened in Downing Street, and what we are finding out, is fundamental,” he said. “What I think is fundamental is that we look in the inquiry at how the rules were devised, and the effect that they had.”  Asked about the fines on Sky News, the Wales secretary, Simon Hart, dismissed calls for Boris Johnson to resign, saying “the world has moved on a considerable distance”.  Citing the views of his constituents, Hart said: “Throughout all of this saga of the Downing Street parties they have said one thing very clearly, and in a vast majority: they want contrition, they want an apology, but they don’t want a resignation.”

The comment, from mid-2021, is reported in This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future by Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, two New York Times reporters.  The book is due out in May. Last month, Politico reported passages in which Jill Biden, now the first lady, is critical of her husband’s decision to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Reporting Biden’s remark about Murdoch, CNN said the president had never spoken in public about the 91-year-old media baron and Fox News owner.  The president did tell a town hall audience he sometimes “turn[s] on Fox to find out how popular I am”. He also apologised to a Fox News White House reporter, Peter Doocy, for calling him a “stupid son of a bitch”.  According to Burns and Martin, Biden “assessed” Murdoch to be “one of the most destructive forces in the United States”.  Fox News anchors including Tucker Carlson have prominently relayed coronavirus misinformation and spoken favorably of Vladimir Putin and Russia. The network has been sued for giving voice to Donald Trump’s lies about electoral fraud in his defeat by Biden, who is now a target for daily ridicule by Fox News hosts.  The White House and Fox News did not immediately comment.  Fox News is broadly supportive of Trump. But Murdoch has clashed with the former president.  In January 2018, the author Michael Wolff reported that Murdoch, a US citizen born in Australia, called Trump a “fucking idiot” over his views on immigration.  Last year, Wolff reported that Murdoch personally approved Fox News’ call of Arizona for Biden, a decision that indicated Trump would lose his re-election fight. Fox News denied it.  Wolff told Brian Stelter, the CNN host who on Sunday revealed Biden’s comment about Murdoch, that Murdoch “hates Donald Trump. Hates him – but Rupert loves money”.  Stelter is the author of a book of his own, Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth, published in 2020.  As the Guardian reported, the book reports that Trump’s second attorney general, William Barr, told Murdoch a Fox News personality critical of Trump should be “muzzled”.

A week after one of the most chaotic Oscars in recent memory – during which Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage – the Grammys seemed to revel in its technical proficiency and lack of controversy. “We’re gonna be listening to some music, we’re gonna be dancing, we’re gonna be singing, we’re gonna be keeping people’s names out of our mouths,” said host Trevor Noah in his opening monologue, acknowledging the elephant in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.  “Don’t even think of it as an awards show,” said Noah, who returned to the Grammys stage after emceeing last year’s Covid-straitened ceremony. “This is a concert where we give out awards.”  Indeed, after years of controversy over the recording academy’s lack of diversity, recognition of hip-hop or inclusion of female artists, the 2022 Grammys mostly stuck to the music, with only nine televised awards in what was essentially a revue of two years in popular music.  Noah acted as an amiable, enthusiastic hype man with a handful of light quips on Covid vaccines (last year “people were doing shots, but it was more Moderna and Pfizer”) and NFTs (“You know it’s been rough when your favorite artists go from trying to sell you music to trying to sell you pictures of digital monkeys”).  He struck a more serious note halfway through the ceremony, introducing Zelenskiy: “Even in the darkest times, music has the power to lift spirits and give you hope for a brighter tomorrow. There’s nobody who could use a little hope right now more than the people of Ukraine.”  01:30 Ukraine's president appears in video message at 2022 Grammys – video  In a pre-filmed video, a noticeably hoarse Zelenskiy cast music as an embodiment of peace and freedom. “The war. What is more opposite to music?” he said. “The silence of ruined cities and killed people. Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars.  “The war doesn’t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence,” he continued. “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.”  Zelenskiy praised his countrymen (“We defend our freedom. To live. To love. To sound. On our land, we are fighting Russia which brings horrible silence with its bombs. The dead silence. Fill the silence with your music! Fill it today to tell our story”) and urged Grammy viewers to publicly support Ukraine. “I have a dream of them living,” he said of the Ukrainian people. “And free. Free like you on the Grammy stage.”  The message served as an introduction to a John Legend performance of Free, along with Ukrainian musicians Mika Newton and Siuzanna Iglidan, and Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk.  In his second year as executive producer of the Grammys, taking over after Ken Ehrlich’s 40-year tenure, Ben Winston mostly allowed individual artists to shine. Rodrigo, who took home best new artist and best pop vocal album for Sour, sang her record-smashing breakout hit Drivers License from behind the wheel of a vintage Mercedes, with a full American suburban street set.  no thoughts head empty just olivia rodrigo singing her grammy winning song at the #GRAMMYs 🥲 pic.twitter.com/yxN4GRNk3z — 💭 (@livsthinker) April 4, 2022  Brandi Carlile drew a standing ovation for Right on Time, an operatic ballad of regret and second chances. New York-bred rap legend Nas – “your rapper’s favorite rapper,” as Noah introduced him – performed a medley of hits (and also drew a standing ovation from the crowd, including Lil Nas X). Lady Gaga paid tribute to long-time friend and collaborator Tony Bennett, who retired from live performances last year at the age of 95 on doctor’s order (Bennett has lived with Alzheimer’s for several years, he revealed). Jon Batiste, the night’s most-nominated artist with 11 nods, kicked off a sprightly, retro-futurist performance of Freedom with a dramatic, starkly lit piano solo.

Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters  In a self-conscious nod to the Academy’s reputational woes – which has led artists such as the Weeknd and Frank Ocean to snub the awards entirely – new president Harvey Mason Jr promised “at the new Recording Academy, we serve music” in a video message. The show celebrated live music producers – the behind-the-scenes workers who helped bring live concerts back from pandemic closures – by inviting some to introduce their artists. Road tour manager Misha Hedman Mayes introduced HER, whom she has known since the R&B star was just 11 years old. Wardrobe supervisor Joan Lee pitched her collaborator and boss, Carrie Underwood, who won best roots gospel album for My Savior. Tour manager Nicole Massey, who shouted out to all “women in touring”, set the stage for “the best 20-year-old boss in the world”, Billie Eilish, who performed a rain-soaked rendition of Happier Than Ever. Eilish’s brother/producer Finneas accompanied her on guitar, wearing a shirt honoring Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died unexpectedly last week at age 50 while on tour in Colombia.  Noah also acknowledged Hawkins, who was supposed to perform with the Foo Fighters at the ceremony. The remembrance kicked off the night’s In Memoriam segment: Dear Evan Hansen star Ben Platt, Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo, Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr and West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler sang a medley of songs by the late musical theater titan Stephen Sondheim, who died last November at 91.  ‘This is a big deal,’ said Doja Cat, who won best pop duo performance with SZA. Photograph: Steve Marcus/Reuters  Amid all the music, there were a handful of lighthearted speeches. “I have never taken such a fast piss in my whole life,” said Doja Cat, who apparently rushed from the bathroom to the stage to accept the award for best pop duo performance with SZA, for Kiss Me More. “I like to downplay shit,” she said through tears, “but this is a big deal.”  Silk Sonic, AKA Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, grooved on to the stage for both record and song of the year. “We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,” Anderson .Paak quipped. “Drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight!”  Jon Batiste closed the evening with, fittingly, a celebration of music for album of the year. “I believe this to my core: there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor,” he said. “The creative arts are subjective and they reach people at a point in their lives when they need it most.”  The 2022 Grammy winners in full  Album of the year  Jon Batiste – We Are – WINNER  Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga – Love for Sale  Justin Bieber – Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe)  Doja Cat – Planet Her (Deluxe)  Billie Eilish – Happier Than Ever  HER – Back of My Mind  Lil Nas X – Montero  Olivia Rodrigo – Sour  Taylor Swift – Evermore  Kanye West – Donda  Record of the year  ABBA – I Still Have Faith in You  Jon Batiste – Freedom  Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga – I Get a Kick Out of You  Justin Bieber featuring Daniel Cesar and Giveon – Peaches  Brandi Carlile – Right on Time  Doja Cat featuring SZA – Kiss Me More  Billie Eilish – Happier Than Ever  Lil Nas X – Montero (Call Me by Your Name)  Olivia Rodrigo – Drivers License  Silk Sonic – Leave the Door Open – WINNER  Best pop/duo group performance  Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga – I Get a Kick Out of You  Justin Bieber and Benny Blanco – Lonely  BTS – Butter  Coldplay – Higher Power  Doja Cat featuring SZA – Kiss Me More – WINNER  Best pop vocal album  Justin Bieber – Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe)  Doja Cat – Planet Her (Deluxe)  Billie Eilish – Happier Than Ever  Ariana Grande – Positions  Olivia Rodrigo – Sour – WINNER  Best R&B album  Snoh Aalegra – Temporary Highs in the Violet Skies  Jon Batiste – We Are  Leon Bridges – Gold-Diggers Sound  HER – Back of My Mind  Jazmine Sullivan – Heaux Tales – WINNER  Best rap performance  Baby Keem featuring Kendrick Lamar – Family Ties – WINNER  Cardi B – Up  J.

Although her findings come in many shapes and sizes, in her years as a researcher, she and her colleagues have struggled to get their biological discoveries out to the wider scientific community. With Spanish as her mother tongue, her research had to be translated into English to be published. That wasn’t always possible because of budget or time constraints –and it means that some of her findings were never published.  “It’s not that I’m a bad scientist,” she says. “It’s just because of the language.”  Ramírez Castañeda is not alone. There is a plethora of research in non-English-language papers that gets lost in translation, or is never translated, creating a gap in the global community’s scientific knowledge. As the amount of scientific research grows, so does the gap. This is especially true for conservation and biodiversity. Research about native traditions and knowledge tied to biodiversity is often conducted in the domestic non-colonial language and isn’t translated.  It’s not that I’m a bad scientist. It’s just because of the language Valeria Ramírez Castañeda, Colombian biologist  A study published in the journal Plos Biology found that paying more attention to non-English language research could expand the geographical coverage of biodiversity scientific evidence by 12% to 25% and the number of species covered by 5% to 32%. There is research on nine amphibian species, 217 bird species and 64 mammal species not covered in English-language studies. “We are essentially not using scientific evidence published in non-English-languages at the international level, but if we could make a better use of [it], we might be able to fill the existing gaps in the variability of current scientific evidence,” says Tatsuya Amano, a Japanese biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland and the paper’s lead researcher.  His team pored over more than 400,000 peer-reviewed papers in 16 different languages and found 1,234 studies providing evidence on biodiversity conservation which, because they weren’t in English, may have been overlooked. These included Japanese-language findings on the effectiveness of relocating the endangered Blakiston’s fish owl, the largest owl species, and a Spanish-language study on the use of guardian dogs to alleviate conflict between farmers and Andean mountain cats in Patagonia.  A study on relocating the Blakiston’s fish owl may have been overlooked because it was published in Japanese, researchers found.

Some experts believe English should be the lingua franca of science. Scott Montgomery, a geoscientist at the University of Washington and author of Does Science Need a Global Language? argues that for the sake of the bigger picture, scientific knowledge should converge into one common language.  “Science is very globalised and becoming more so, so the use of a global language is enormous for that. It’s not just for efficiency, it’s for collaboration,” Montgomery says. “I make the point that learning English should be something similar to learning mathematics for scientists. It’s just a very basic, fundamental skill that you need to participate.” Where that isn’t possible, other languages should be translated into English, he adds.  Translating science into a more widely used language has been standard practice in history, according to Michael Gordin, a science historian at Princeton University. “This kind of chain of translations is a thing that’s been going on in the history of science for millennia,” he says. “Arabic knowledge, which was very prominent from about the ninth century to the 13th century, some of it was Persian translated into Arabic, but a lot of it was Greek and Syriac translated into Arabic, and more.”  However, the amount of scientific knowledge that needs translating is huge. One potential solution is to extend the use of machine translation, which was initially developed to translate Russian science into English, according to Gordin. Another option would be to have large international scientific organisations subsidise the translation and copy-editing of local science into a universal language. It also could be possible to transition to a world where, say, Chinese, English and Spanish are the three languages of science and scientists were expected to have a passive knowledge of all three, just as English, French and German were the languages of science in the 19th century.  It is a problem worth tackling because this language gap also widens the gap between the global north and south, argues Nina Hunter, a researcher at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa.  Valeria Ramírez Castañeda and a colleague at work studying Amazonian snakes. Photograph: Courtesy of Valeria Ramírez Castañeda  “Global south scientists and their science aren’t taken into consideration in the same way, because it’s all just based on the kind of criteria that are easy for the global north,” she says. In a recent paper, she argues that in the fight to combat the climate crisis, researchers from Lusophone Africa (Portuguese-speaking African countries) are being marginalised.  Inequality in international influence is also a result of unequal access to knowledge, because of that language gap, according to Hunter. Many biologists from indigenous communities in South America or Africa, who have already had to learn the colonial language of the nation, are cut off from accruing more personal and professional knowledge for their research because so much of it is published solely in a language they don’t understand.  Scientists can work with an English collaborator, or use a translator – but this ultimately strengthens the cycle of dependency on the global north, according to Ramírez Castañeda, who is currently a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. After her initial publishing struggles, she went on to study science communication and published an article on the difficulties facing Colombian researchers.  The specific meanings of words can also pose a problem in translation, she says. For example, in the work she does with indigenous communities in the Amazon, many of the local languages don’t have one single word to describe forest snakes and frogs.  “So we’re losing observations for science, too,” says Ramírez Castañeda. “For me, it’s not possible to just have everything translated to English. We need multilingual science, and we need people that feel comfortable doing science in their own languages.”  Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features

Born in August 1922, four months before the proclamation of the Soviet Union, Bahatelya lived through the Holodomor, when Joseph Stalin’s regime visited an artificial famine on large areas of Ukraine by confiscating its grain stocks. She survived the second world war, even after spending two years in a Nazi slave camp in Austria.  She has outlived the Soviet Union and then made it through the difficult 1990s, when the Ukrainian economy left many in poverty. This January she survived a vicious bout of Covid, despite being unvaccinated. Now, four months short of her century, she faces yet another challenge: Vladimir Putin’s war on her country.  “Now again, the people are suffering,” she said at her home on the outskirts of Kyiv, where she lives with her 69-year-old daughter, Olha Punyk.  Speaking loudly, with an imploring tone and the cadence of poetry, Bahatelya gives sharp and clear recollections of the various ordeals she has been through, but grew angry when asked about the Russian president, making a rude hand gesture and calling him: “The worst man in the world.”  Her hearing these days is not so good, but even she can hear the loud booms coming from Brovary, just a few miles from her home on the edge of the capital, which was pounded by Russian strikes in the first part of the war.  Punyk taped over the windows in her mother’s room and has brought dark curtains for the windows, but said the renewed military action has brought back traumatic memories for her mother. Most people over 80 in Ukraine have lived through a lot. One historian has termed Ukraine and the wider region “the bloodlands” – the territories caught between the violence of Hitler and Stalin that saw terror, war and the Holocaust in the mid years of the 20th century.  Sometimes, the most practical option has been to try to shield older people from the realities of the new war to prevent the traumas of the past returning. At one old people’s home in Kyiv, the director has spent the past weeks doing everything to shut out the fact that life outside is in any way different. “A lot of my people have absolutely no idea what is happening outside the fence,” said the director, who asked not to be named.  Some elderly people are all too aware, however. Anatoliy Ruban, 84, lives alone on the far western outskirts of Kyiv, just a short distance from the Russian forward positions outside the city. There has been constant shelling nearby since the war started. “I hear everything: the explosions and the sirens. When it’s loud, I sit in the bathroom until it’s finished,” he said.  Ruban was a child during the second world war in Kyiv, but he remembers it vividly, and the recent action has brought the memories flooding back. “I remember my mum put me on a cart and we rode out of the city, and I remember bullets flying around above my head,” he said.  After the outbreak of this war, Ruban declined the suggestion that he should leave Kyiv for a safer place in western Ukraine or Europe, and indeed has still been going to work for the past month, working 24-hour shifts as a janitor at a youth sports hall. “I take it all calmly, I’ve seen war with my own eyes before. A person is forced to adapt to everything. I refuse to go anywhere, and nobody is waiting for me anyway,” he said.  Putin is the scariest man in the world – I just hope that lunatic doesn’t press the nuclear button. That’s what I fear most Anatoliy Ruban, 84, janitor  Ruban served in the Soviet army in the late 1950s and used to count Russians among his friends, but said he was now disgusted with the neighbouring state and particularly its leader. “Putin is the scariest man in the world – I just hope that lunatic doesn’t press the nuclear button. That’s what I’m really scared of,” he said.  Bahatelya is also aware of what is happening, though her daughter does her best to shield her from the worst of it. “I try to turn the television off when there’s news about the war – she just gets very upset and starts talking about the last war,” she said.  In June 1943, after the Nazis occupied Bahatelya’s village, she was sent along with millions of other women to be an Ostarbeiter, the term the Nazis gave to civilians captured in occupied territories and forced into slave labour inside the Third Reich.  She spent two years living in a camp in the small Austrian town of Ternitz and working in a factory there. “We had a quarter loaf of bread in the morning and a thin soup twice a day, then potatoes on Sunday,” she recalled.  When the war was coming to a close, as Soviet soldiers moved westwards, Bahatelya went the other way, walking to Budapest before journeying home by train to find her whole village destroyed. Back then, she considered herself a patriotic Soviet citizen and the Russians to be a fraternal nation.  Her daughter said: “She told me that when Stalin died, she cried. She cried sincere tears, because they thought it was a tragedy. They were zombified back then, just like the Russians are zombified by their propaganda today.”  Asked what she would like for her 100th birthday, Bahatelya said she had one wish: “I’d like him to die,” she said. It was clear who she meant.

Katonina held up a sign that read “No to war”, but few in the crowd knew that they (Katonina’s preferred pronoun) were Russian.  They said: “Onlookers thought we were Ukrainians because our people look the same. It was crucial for us to stand apart and show that Russians also oppose the war. We needed to identify ourselves.”  Katonina said it was obviously impossible to go to the protests with the country’s traditional white, blue and red flag. “Unfortunately, the Russian tricolour has been completely appropriated by the state propaganda and the military,” Katonina said. “We needed a flag that had no connection to violence and war.”  So Katonina and their friends came up with a solution: a white, blue and white striped flag. “It is as if someone threw white paint over the red, over the bloodshed that is going on,” Katonina said.  But they were not the only ones to have the idea – it was soon seen at other protests around the world. “It was funny to see that at the very same time, other Russians opposing the war were putting forward the very same flag. Some unconscious collaboration was going on,” they said.  The flag was originally used in Veliky Novgorod, one of the oldest cities in Russia and known as the cradle of national democracy – its citizens were full participants in representative rule as early as the 12th century.  “The Veliky Novgorod symbolism was important to us. It was as democratic as a place could be in the 12th century,” Katonina said.  Members of Prague’s Russian community draped in the flag. Photograph: Michal Čížek/AFP/Getty  The flag has since been embraced on social media as well as by Russian anti-war protesters on the streets.  Russian poets, artists and musicians, as well as Russia’s main opposition movement, led by supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, have also backed the use of the flag.  The Free Russia Forum in Vilnius, a leading opposition group outside the country, called the new flag a symbol “of peace and freedom”. The group said: “Why is the new symbol important? Because it frees Russians of their ties to the Kremlin. By showing this flag, we – Russians – can say no to the war, no to dictatorship, and no to censorship. This isn’t the symbol of a state, it’s a symbol of people joining together.”  Katonina said they were also inspired by the events in Belarus, where thousands of protesters used a white-red-white striped flag during rallies after the country’s disputed elections.  An anti-war march in London last month. Photograph: Mark Phillips/Alamy  This flag, first used during the short-lived Belarusian national republic in 1918, became such an irritant to the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko that even people wearing socks in its colours have faced prosecution.  Unsurprisingly, the new Russian flag has also drawn the ire of the Kremlin, and officials last week proposed banning it as an “extremist” symbol.  Vladimir Putin and state media have sought to create their own pro-war symbols. Most notably, the Latin letter Z has gone from being a military marking to the main sign of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  But the new Russian flag has gained more traction among the country’s large émigré communities, which have been swollen by Russians who have left the country since the outbreak of the war.  As Putin is effectively criminalising dissent over the war, tens of thousands of Russians have departed, and the main hubs of organised opposition movements are now abroad. Like-minded Russians have since been gathering at protests and anti-war concerts in cities across Europe, including Istanbul, London, Riga and Warsaw.  At one of those concerts, given recently by the prominent Russian rapper Oxxxymiron, hundreds of Russians came together at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London.  “Millions of Russians are against this war,” the rapper said, as he stood over a cheering crowd … some of them waving the new flag.

It is part of a series of pictures that Cegarra has taken of the “second wall”, the legacy of Donald Trump’s agreement with Mexico that refugees are returned across the border to await asylum hearings. The boy holding his head in his hands is from Honduras; the volunteers blowing bubbles are part of Bay Area Border Relief, a humanitarian organisation from San Francisco. Cegarra’s pictures, shortlisted in the documentary category of this year’s Sony world photography awards, shine a light on those thousands of childhoods lost to the escalating aggression of immigration policies.  Having failed to get Mexico to pay for his mythical wall, in 2018 Trump threatened incoming Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador with tariffs on all Mexican goods unless he acceded to the “Remain in Mexico” policy by which asylum seekers would be held south of the border to await US court hearings. President Biden repealed this policy at the beginning of last year but it was reimposed by legal action from the Republican-controlled states of Missouri and Texas.  When Cegarra took this picture, there were more than 75,000 people incarcerated in makeshift camps like this one at Matamoros, waiting for a hearing, and a backlog of more than 1m immigration cases in the American courts. Biden has pledged to have cases heard within 180 days, but on average the delays on asylum hearings are running to just under five years. Those waiting are vulnerable to extortion by people traffickers and drug cartels and brutalisation by local police. By the end of the Trump presidency, the percentage of successful asylum applications stood at 0.1% of all cases. The promised wall exists in brutal legal reality for the children in Matamoros, if not in concrete fact.

Calling Russian soldiers “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, Zelenskiy said late on Sunday: “your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women”. He warned that “even worse things” may be found in other occupied regions.  Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Satellite images taken late last week show a 14-metre (45ft) mass grave in Bucha near the Church of St Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Maxar, the company that took the pictures, said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave there were seen on 10 March, several weeks into the invasion.  Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers had fired on men fleeing the town, and had killed civilians at will. Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field. Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”.  Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, 77, said she had witnessed an elderly man who had challenged a Russian soldier being shot dead as his wife stood next to him. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said. The accounts could not be independently verified.  01:48 Civilians lie dead in the street as Russian forces retreat from Bucha – video  Photographs from the town showed a scene of devastation, with hunks of charred and destroyed tanks and armoured vehicles lined up along one street, along with dead bodies.  Zelenskiy on Sunday made a surprise video appearance at the Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country “in any way you can”.  “Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence,” Zelenskiy said in English in a video introducing John Legend’s performance of Free and featured Ukrainian musicians and a reading by Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuck.  Russia denied responsibility for the killing of civilians. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos from towns such as Bucha as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”, echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol.  Figures around the world have condemned the brutality of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s forces.  The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the “despicable” killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha. “Streets littered with bodies. Bodies buried in makeshift conditions. There is talk of women, children and the elderly among the victims,” Scholz said. His defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said the European Union should consider a ban on gas imports from Russia.  US secretary of state Antony Blinken described the images from retaken towns as “a punch in the gut” while United Nations secretary general António Guterres called for an independent investigation.  The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army”, adding that “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”.  The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”.  01:34 Bucha resident recounts finding husband dead in basement – video  Zelenskiy said he expected a UN security council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the atrocities, and was scathing on Sunday night of a historic western policy of “appeasing” Russia by failing to make Ukraine a Nato member 14 years ago at a summit in Bucharest. He invited former German and French leaders Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy to visit Bucha “to see what the policy of concessions” to Russia has led to, and urged Ukraine’s allies to do more than increase sanctions.  Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia warned on Monday against inferring much from the withdrawal of Russian forces around Kyiv. “They are now regrouping. They are using it as an operational pause and I’m sure they will mount another assault and therefore we need support of the free world to help us fight,” said ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko.  “We see civilians’ dead bodies lying around the city, many of them have their hands tied up. We are now collecting the evidence from the witnesses,” Myroshnychenko said of the recent discoveries in town such as Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel. “Multiple rapes of women, children killed. This is a massacre.”  The west needed to provide heavy weapons, air defence systems, anti-ship missiles, armoured, vehicles, tanks and planes to help Ukraine, the ambassador said. “It’s only two and a half flight from Kyiv to Paris. We’re in the middle of Europe and this is happening now in the 21st century.”  In other developments:

In a statement, Crvena Zvezda confirmed that the players were instructed by club officials not to hold up the banner because of the use of the Ukrainian flag colours.

Images of murdered civilians lying in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha read more have incensed Western public opinion. The atrocities, which Kyiv blames on Moscow, will inevitably trigger a tougher round of European sanctions.  Brussels has several options to rachet up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin, whose armed forces deny the allegations of war crimes. One would be to add top lenders like Sberbank (SBER.MM) and Gazprombank to the list of Russian institutions barred from the SWIFT payments-messaging system; another would be a partial trade embargo enforced by prohibiting Russian vessels from docking at EU ports; more potent still would be an EU ban on Russian energy imports, whose $1 billion-a-day proceeds help Putin finance his war against Ukraine.  Energy sanctions would certainly hurt Russia. Moscow cannot simply turn to India and China to replace the 155 billion cubic metres of gas it exports annually to the 27-nation bloc. Oil, which can travel by ship, is in theory more fungible and therefore less susceptible to an EU ban. It also brought in three times the $60 billion Moscow earned from gas in 2021 read more . Yet Russia’s sulfur-rich Urals crude is harder to refine than, say, Saudi crude, and outside Europe the specialist refining facilities that can handle it are uncommon.

Berlin derives about 55% of its natural gas, half its coal and a third of its oil from Russia. In Germany, a full energy embargo would mean rationing and a further spike in already sky-high hydrocarbon prices.  There are alternatives. Europe could impose a cap on the price it was prepared to pay, effectively demanding a discount. Yet such a move would endanger contractual agreements with Russia. A simpler alternative would be to force Moscow to pay a border tax on hydrocarbons arriving in Europe. The concept borrows from the carbon border tax already under discussion to reduce carbon dioxide emissions outside Europe. Importantly, it would not require the breaking of existing contracts.  Such a halfway-house option could keep Germany happy while still being relatively painful for Moscow.  Follow @LJucca on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Social unrest will probably accelerate a restructuring of some $44 billion of international sovereign debt. Though Sri Lanka’s problems follow years of mismanagement, its speedy unravelling is a warning to sturdier economies from Europe to Asia suddenly grappling with a spike in the cost of living.  A current account crisis read more has intensified after the West fired its sanctions bazooka at Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine. Rolling blackouts and a state of emergency are frightening away remaining tourists, a crucial source of foreign exchange. Food inflation hit an eye-watering 30.2% in March. The currency’s 40% depreciation against the U.S. dollar in one month, including a central bank managed devaluation, is blowing out leverage ratios: Public debt estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 120% of GDP is perhaps some 40 percentage points more than might be deemed sustainable, guesses Citi.  A worsening crisis mutes the impact of disjointed financial lifelines, including a $1.5 billion currency swap from China in December and rice and diesel shipments from India. The IMF notes that policies required to reduce debt to sustainable levels are neither economically nor politically feasible. Hence, Sri Lanka’s $1 billion bond maturing in July trades at 67 cents on the U.S. dollar, compared to about 74 cents at the start of February. Haircuts will stretch from China to Wall Street, where market borrowings accounted for 47% of Sri Lanka’s foreign government debt as of April last year.

Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, few Asian countries had consumer inflation in double digits. The standouts were Sri Lanka and Pakistan, whose Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday dodged a no-confidence vote and called fresh elections. Poorer countries are more vulnerable to surging global food prices because their populations spend more on food than discretionary items. But pandemic dislocations to supply chains and trade meant advanced economies overall were facing a jump in prices three times bigger than emerging markets between 2019 to 2022, per IMF estimates in January.  Whether countries rush to deal with surging prices with tax cuts, or ramping up subsidies, Sri Lanka’s speedy unravelling offers a warning of the political risks of complacency.

The world's biggest hamburger chain -- which for years has wanted to stop the use of "McJob" as shorthand for low-wage, dead-end work -- said it plans to hire up to 50,000 new U.S. workers on Tuesday.  WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Too much of a good thing can be bad for the U.S. Federal Reserve. The unemployment rate for Americans fell to 3.6% in March, near pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, dining out is back and even travel is returning to normal. It all gives the central bank room to raise interest rates to fight inflation. But continued robust hiring may make price pressures worse.  The United States is closing in on full employment. That’s where the Fed thought the economy was before Covid-19 hit, with a jobless rate of 3.5% in February 2020. Last month, employers added a decent 431,000 jobs, while other upward revisions put average monthly gains for the first quarter at 562,000 positions, the Labor Department said on Friday.  Other activities are also back on track. Roughly as many people are dining in U.S. restaurants as in 2019, according to reservation-software provider OpenTable. And the number of travelers who passed through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in the last seven days of March reached 90% of the level seen in the same week of 2019.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The return toward pre-pandemic normality - even in a period coinciding with Russia's disruptive invasion of Ukraine - makes the Fed’s job easier. Central bank boss Jerome Powell read more has recently taken on a more hawkish tone, highlighting that the labor market is strong enough to hike rates by 0.5 percentage points at future meetings if warranted by inflation. In March, rate-setters increased the cost of borrowing by half that amount.  Still, hiring patterns suggest imbalances remain. In February, job vacancies were still near record levels at 11.3 million while there were on average 60 unemployed persons for each 100 of those positions, compared to 80 in February 2020. The pace at which people quit their jobs remained high at 4.4 million, with retail, hotels and restaurants continuing to see the biggest exodus.  The fight for scarce workers could put more pressure on prices. Hourly wages increased 5.6% over the year to March, against pre-pandemic bumps in the 3% range. Full employment would be welcomed by the Fed after the labor market pains induced by the pandemic. Up to a point, so would higher wages, especially for lower-paid workers. But blowing past that would risk overheating an economy already grappling with inflation.

The colossal 143-metre vessel, designed by star architect Philippe Starck and sporting an underwater observation pod, belongs to Russian coal and fertiliser tycoon Andrey Melnichenko read more , who has been sanctioned by the European Union. Impounding trophy assets is an easy win for governments. Navigating complex sanctions rules is more costly and complicated.  Russian yachts are headline-grabbing targets. The country’s tycoons have been enthusiastic buyers of luxury boats, an industry that was worth 8 billion euros in 2021, according to Bain & Company. They are particularly fond of larger vessels: Russians accounted for between 30% and 40% of the market for mega-yachts longer than 60 meters, Massimo Perotti, the chairman of listed yachtmaker Sanlorenzo (SNL.MI), told Breakingviews.  Yet impounding large boats is a bigger legal headache than seizing property or cash. Though the oligarchs are still the legal owners, the vessels require maintenance and crew to stay afloat. Annual bills are around 3% of the boat’s original price tag, says Perotti. With Russian owners banned from making payments, governments may have to foot the bill, hoping to recoup the cost once sanctions are lifted.

The vessels are often controlled by shell companies to conceal their ultimate owner’s identity. The 38 million pound yacht Phi, impounded in London’s Canary Wharf earlier this week and which the British government says is owned by an associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is registered to a St Kitts and Nevis company and carries a Maltese flag.  Italian officials are still trying to figure out who owns the $700 million Scheherazade, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy alleges belongs to Putin or a member of his circle read more . Governments are likely to face legal battles disputing seizures, or fights over costs. Meanwhile, a ban on luxury exports to Russia means boats still under construction are in legal limbo.  Sanctions rules make little provision for the long-term fate of the boats. Several U.S. congressmen have proposed a Yachts for Ukraine Act, which would sell the assets to raise cash. But doing so would flood the super-yacht market with second-hand vessels. For now, governments have no choice but to navigate choppy sanctions waters.

REUTERS/Aly Song - RC19BA3710A0  HONG KONG, April 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - In the late 1980s American aerospace company McDonnell Douglas was locked in a life-or-death struggle with rival Boeing (BA.N). Having assessed the vast potential of the Chinese aviation market, it signed a $1 billion deal in 1992 to supply jetliners to the People’s Republic. At the same time, the company entered into a joint venture with Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation to assemble the planes inside China. The hope was that Beijing would direct local airlines to prefer its products, even though it would help the country learn to build a domestic rival to U.S. aircraft.  It was a massive mistake. The MD-90 probably inspired China’s ARJ-21 regional jet, but local orders never came. “Chinese airlines simply do not want to buy an airplane that’s been manufactured in China,” raged one baffled executive. “It’s totally amazing that the Chinese system permits this.” The miscalculation contributed to McDonnell Douglas’ ultimate merger with Boeing.  Capitalists have a long and mixed history of pandering to dictatorial regimes. In “America Second: How America’s Elites Are Making China Stronger”, journalist-turned-China-risk-consultant Isaac Stone Fish catalogues those who kowtowed to Beijing, from erstwhile Disney (DIS.N) Chief Executive Michael Eisner to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. It’s fun to see the greedy and hypocritical named and shamed. However, the profit margin on pandering keeps shrinking.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Stone Fish believes politicians and executives misled American voters in their desire to tap China’s cheap labour force and vast market. “Corporations recognized they couldn’t argue that China was actually making progress on human rights,” he writes, so they insisted economic growth would fix the problem: “Trade with China would both benefit Americans and democratize China.” Stapleton Roy, who was America’s ambassador to China from 1991 to 1995, told Stone Fish that few in the U.S. government believed this thesis. The idea “was used to sell policy, not formulate it.” In the event, China’s opening up stopped far short of democracy, and President Xi Jinping’s rise sent it into reverse.  Today, unable to argue they are advancing democratic norms, some business leaders have pivoted to openly defending the Chinese system, citing its decisiveness and ability to make long-term strategic investments. In private they also argue it keeps pesky social and environmental activists in check. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, believes the United States is doomed to be overtaken by China. Tesla (TSLA.O) boss Elon Musk insults elected U.S. politicians on Twitter but has opened a dealership in Xinjiang, where Beijing has executed a controversial programme to deradicalise Muslim minorities.  For some companies, sucking up appears to have worked. Take Rio Tinto (RIO.L), (RIO.AX). In 2010, Stone Fish writes, the Anglo-Australian miner hired Kissinger to advise it on how to deal with four employees China had convicted for corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Kissinger advised executives to build trust with Beijing, so Rio fired the employees. Five years later, Stone Fish notes, China accounted for 40% of the company’s global revenue, implying the pandering paid off.  Yet the reality is more complicated. Even a vicious tariff spat between China and Australia did not dent Rio’s sales in the People’s Republic, which reached 58% of the total in 2021. Western companies whose products are not as vital to China’s economy were less successful. Meta Platforms (FB.O) founder Mark Zuckerberg spent years publicly praising Xi, and in 2016 the New York Times reported his company was developing a censorship tool that would comply with Chinese law. Yet the social network remains locked out of China.  Meanwhile, industries for which accommodation used to make sense may be having a rethink. Hollywood movies once accounted for 40% of the Chinese box office. Hoping Beijing would relieve them of onerous revenue-sharing requirements and let them release more titles, studio bosses took self-censorship to new extremes. But the restrictions stayed in place, and now local production houses dominate the $7.4 billion market. read more Similarly, in 2016 Apple (AAPL.O) had to commit to invest $275 billion in the country read more to relieve regulatory pressure on its business, according to The Information. That’s more than the $249 billion in revenue the iPhone maker collected in Greater China over the last five years.  The McDonnell Douglas executive who was baffled by the failure of his China venture might have considered that corruption is not the same as stupidity. Executives at Chinese state-owned airlines in the 1990s knew how poor local quality control was. As for Kissinger, China’s paramount leader Mao Zedong described the diplomat as “just a funny little man who shudders all over with nerves every time he comes to see me.” Like most people, Chinese leaders have little respect for sycophants.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  LONDON, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - In a world dominated by passive investors, financial genius consists of owning an index fund in a rising market. That’s been the happy experience of American investors in recent years. But several of the forces that have underpinned financial markets for decades are now going into reverse. Investors need to hedge their portfolios against inflation and bursting bubbles. That requires a more active investment approach.  Four long-term trends have propelled the great bull market in U.S. stocks: the decline of inflation, ever-lower interest rates, the rise of globalisation and the embrace of shareholder value by corporate managers. Quiescent inflation allowed central banks to support financial markets with unconventional monetary policies during periods of turbulence. Falling interest rates helped push up the value of stocks and bonds. The advance of globalisation further dampened inflationary pressures.  Not only did China provide the developed world with cheap exports, but Western companies boosted profits by manufacturing in low-cost regions. Companies that pursued shareholder value – which deems that management’s main role is to maximise the market value of a business – used cheap debt to buy back their shares, thereby boosting their earnings per share, and their stock prices.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  All these trends, which over the years have created trillions of dollars of financial wealth, are now going backwards. Inflation in the United States approached 8% in February, its highest level since 1981. Caught asleep at the wheel, the Federal Reserve is now in inflation-fighting mode: it raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% in mid-March, with a further six hikes expected over the course of the year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further shaken faith in globalisation. Corporations face rising input costs and need to reconfigure their supply chains. Higher interest charges are set to make buybacks less attractive.  Milton Friedman’s claim that the company’s social responsibility is to maximise its profits finds fewer advocates in today’s boardrooms. Instead, management teams are prioritising social and environmental concerns. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also making life harder for activist investors and wants publicly traded companies to comprehensively report their climate risks. Whatever the merits of these regulations, they are likely to push up costs in the near term.  Passive investors are therefore in a perilous position. Despite some wobbles in recent months, the U.S. stock market remains at bubble levels. Having captured all the upside of the bull market, index funds are exposed to whatever downside is in the offing. As long as inflation persists, the traditional buy-and-hold investment approach is likely to deliver volatile returns and, given current valuations, the real possibility of permanent capital losses.  Whether they know it or not, investors are engaged in “The Battle for Investment Survival”. This is the title of the 1935 investment classic by an American stockbroker named Gerald Loeb. Loeb’s investment philosophy was shaped by the harrowing experience of the Great Depression.  In his view, financial markets were dangerous places and the business of preserving capital, let alone compounding it, was fraught. Loeb rejected conventional nostrums: he didn’t believe investors should be fully invested at all times. Nor did he believe that one should buy and hold stocks. He also rejected diversification. Instead, Loeb recommended that capital should be “deployed like a rabbit darting here and there for cover”. For most of the time, investors should keep their powder dry.  Markets are roiled by so many unexpected events – politics, war, and shifts in public sentiment – that safe investment was impossible. To protect capital it was necessary to speculate, said Loeb, taking large bets when the opportunity arises and cutting losses whenever they appear. Forget about the long run: it was easier to tell what lies immediately ahead than in the distant future. Short-turn trading, Loeb claimed, is “certainly the safest form of speculation that exists”.  In every respect, Loeb’s advice is the opposite to that of his more celebrated contemporary, Benjamin Graham, the author of “Security Analysis”. But while Graham suffered major losses in the Great Crash of 1929, Loeb claims to have sold all his stocks before the market tumbled.  In later editions of his book, Loeb considered the problem of inflation. In his view, the preservation of purchasing power should be the prime aim of investment. But this was no easy task: “The investor buying inflation hedges is more apt to get into trouble than keep out of it,” he wrote. “Stocks are only good inflation hedges if bought at the right time and at the right price.”  Inflation-hedging is also the subject of a thought-provoking recent essay by Henry Maxey, chief investment officer of London-based Ruffer LLP. Inflationary pressures may be around for a time, Maxey points out. The path to inflation is not straight but has many twists and turns. Since the modern financial world is highly leveraged, it is acutely sensitive to rising interest rates. The danger is that when the Fed taps the brake pedal in order to slow inflation, Wall Street will fly straight through the windscreen.  Given these circumstances, it is pointless to invest for the inflation endgame. Instead, Maxey says investors should hedge against inflation volatility – the prospect that the market’s psychology switches abruptly from fears of inflation to concerns about deflation, and back again. This requires an active approach to investment. It’s time to turn off the investment autopilot, proclaims Maxey. As the great management guru Peter Drucker once wrote: “The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence. It is to act with yesterday’s logic.”  The Fed is now tightening. Positive fiscal and monetary policies are in retreat. Inflationary pressures, Maxey predicts, will fall sharply when the tripwires are hit. At this point policymakers will hit the gas pedal, again. Passive investors and inflation-hedgers are likely to get whipsawed. There’s one simple way to stay out of trouble, recommended by both Loeb and Maxey: hold plenty of cash in reserve. As Loeb points out, while inflation erodes the value of money over a period of time, stock markets can evaporate fortunes in a flash. Let the battle commence.

Fans of the element, seen as the missing link in the fight against climate change, advocate either its “blue” variant, made from natural gas with most of the carbon captured and removed, or its “green” one, made using renewable electricity. An actual war in Ukraine has allowed green to pull decisively ahead.  Much of hydrogen’s excitement relates to its ability to decarbonise heavy industry, one of the trickiest parts of the global economy to clean up. It’s also a handy energy store for when wind and solar power aren’t available. However, only 10% of the 90 million tonnes of hydrogen produced annually is low-carbon, be it blue or green. The remaining 90% is “grey” hydrogen, used mainly in oil refining and fertiliser production. Its manufacture accounts for more than 2% of the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions. The challenge, according to the Hydrogen Council, is to ramp up overall hydrogen output to over 650 million tonnes a year by 2050, with the vast majority of that being of the low-carbon green or blue varieties.  In that light, obsessing over blue or green looks odd. But that hasn’t stopped it happening. Up until last autumn the oil sector-backed blue corner was crowing about the potential for costs under 3 euros per kilogram, based on natural gas prices of under 20 euros per megawatt hour (MWh). The green corner, whose unit costs tend to be at least 4 euros per kg, hit back with a research paper from scientists at Cornell University in the United States lambasting blue hydrogen’s potential to pollute. Ahead of November’s COP26 climate talks, the UK government diplomatically advocated both hues in its hydrogen strategy, only for the pro-green boss of the UK’s hydrogen industry association to quit in protest.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  However, even before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and imperiled European gas supplies, blue’s star was waning. Since last summer, natural gas prices have risen fivefold to over 100 euros per MWh. That radically changes the relative cost dynamics. Even with gas at 80 euros per MWh, grey hydrogen works out at 5 euros per kg, Bernstein reckons; blue, which has the added expense of carbon capture, exceeds 6 euros. At this month’s war-driven peaks, both would have topped 10 euros per kg.  Carbon costs are a material factor, too. Each 1 kg of hydrogen produces 9 kg of carbon dioxide. At the pre-Ukraine war carbon price of around 90 euros a tonne that’s nearly an extra euro for each kg of grey, and a smaller but tangible cost for blue hydrogen. This expense will rise with the carbon price.  The conflict has revealed deeper problems for blue hydrogen, according to Graham Cooley, chief executive of $2.8 billion ITM Power (ITM.L), which makes electrolysis kit to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Besides wildly fluctuating prices, blue hydrogen’s main input – natural gas – may even become unobtainable if shortages lead to rationing. Conversely, green hydrogen’s main input – renewable electricity – has supply driven by the weather, not post-Cold War geopolitics, and costs determined by long-term fixed-price wind and solar power off-take agreements.  You’d expect Cooley to say as much – last year he opened a gleaming new electrolyser factory in Sheffield, Northern England. But governments look more likely now to target green rather than blue. The European Union recently quadrupled its 2030 green hydrogen target to 20 million tonnes, and hiked electrolyser capacity plans from 80 to 200 gigawatts (GW).  However, green hydrogen is not completely free of supply headaches. Currently, the world excluding China has about 5 GW of electrolyser capacity. Hitting 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030, a distinctly modest target, implies 167 GW of kit, according to Liberum Research. Between them, the big non-Chinese electrolysis players like ITM, Nel (NEL.OL), Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) and Plug Power (PLUG.O) as of year-end had only pledged 90 GW by then. The 2050 ambitions imply a mammoth 4,300 GW of electrolysers, plus an epic increase in wind and solar power generation.  Such numbers point to Europe relying on green hydrogen imports and others to ramp up electrolyser supply. A plan by Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest to ship 5 million tonnes of hydrogen annually to Germany by 2030 is punchy but unproblematic geopolitically. Less so is Europe replacing its unhealthy dependence on Russian and Middle Eastern hydrocarbons with an equally questionable dependence on green hydrogen if imports or electrolyser supply chains were controlled by potentially tricky countries like China.  As broad as possible an array of suppliers helps avoid such an outcome. In the meantime, ITM’s share price has jumped nearly 50% since the Ukraine war broke out. Assuming green hydrogen really has won its own internecine conflict, it may have a fair way yet to go.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko - RC21DT9PX9PB  MUMBAI, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The West has sown the seeds of a growing sanctions backlash in emerging markets. The United States designed the sweeping restrictions it slapped on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine to allow Europe to procure the energy it needs read more , and is coordinating gas deliveries to help keep the lights on. Now the White House has belatedly realised the brutal side-effects the measures are having on poorer nations.  A U.S. treasury official acknowledged the problem on Tuesday, noting allies must work together to address global food security challenges. Ukraine and Russia account for 38% of global wheat read more exports, and Russia is a major exporter of fertilisers, accounting for about one fifth of the market in some cases. Developing nations that struggled through the pandemic now face a food crisis that could destabilise their governments.  Waivers and workarounds, the traditional methods for granting relief to countries caught in diplomatic crossfire, might be less effective this time around given the sweeping scope of the sanctions and the complexity of trading links, exacerbated by logistical challenges as shippers struggle with poor security conditions and difficulties insuring themselves.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Buying in bulk is one option. Rich nations could then subsidise wheat supplies and ensure they get to vulnerable importers like Turkey, Egypt and Lebanon. India is sitting on a huge surplus and is well-placed to plug some of the gap. Australia could help too. But it’s harder to coordinate a fix for fertiliser, a shortage of which could see crop yields halve; soaring prices for natural gas, a key input, have prompted companies like Norway’s Yara (YAR.OL) to cut output. Washington might have to guarantee customers to persuade it and others, including Canada’s $56 billion Nutrien (NTR.TO), the largest producer of another type of crop nutrient, potash, to ramp up production.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, the United States was reviewing its reliance on sanctions. President Donald Trump’s administration increased the number of entities facing retaliation by a factor of ten. The side effects are starting to alienate otherwise sympathetic foreign governments the White House needs for wider global policy goals. The freezing of Russia’s foreign exchange will also encourage them to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and the American financial system. If there is too much sloppiness with sanctions, they will eventually blunt themselves.  Follow @ugalani on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard  HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The answer to Ferretti (9638.HK) Chief Executive Alberto Galassi’s baffling confidence in its Hong Kong share sale lies in the South China Sea. The yacht maker is going public on Thursday despite seemingly ever worsening choppy waters: Western sanctions are hitting boat-loving Russian oligarchs; President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive has prompted the country’s own super-rich to lay low; and new Covid-19 outbreaks are depressing Chinese consumer spending and delaying initial public offerings. read more  But China's palm-tree-laden island province of Hainan is coming aboard. It’s the ultimate owner of entities buying a large chunk of the 70% of Ferretti’s IPO going to cornerstone investors. On Friday authorities there passed new rules to promote the yacht industry, part of their aim to boost tourism and pivot away from real estate.  Ferretti priced its IPO on the lower end of the range, valuing it marginally higher than rival Sanlorenzo’s (SNL.MI) 10 times adjusted EBITDA multiple for the next 12 months. Hainan officials will be hoping it’s a seaworthy financial vessel.

THIS IMAGE MAY OFFEND OR DISTURB Bodies of people, who according to residents were shot by Russian soldiers, lie down on the street, amid Russia's invasion on Ukraine, in Bucha, Ukraine April 3, 2022. REUTERS/Mikhail Palinchak  BUCHA, Ukraine, April 4 (Reuters) - A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation.  Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes.  Russia's defence ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging 'crimes' by Russian troops in Bucha were a "provocation," and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents.  But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others which did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions.  In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing.  On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range.  The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers.  Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed, but received no immediate reply.  Russia's defence ministry, in its statement on Sunday said: "During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions." It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region.  Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures.  The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained.  "Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians," Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies.  SHALLOW GRAVE  Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head.  Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents.  Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv.  She and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command centre in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived.  She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were, and demanded to see documents.  She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would "cut us up." She did not say how she knew he was Chechen.  Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply.  Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived.  "I recognised him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold," she said. "My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."  Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound.  After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbours buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough "so dogs wouldn't eat him," she said.  Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity.  "SHOT IN LEFT EYE"  Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a woman resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops. She did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct.  One of the residents said she recognised one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military.  Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southwards toward the capital.  Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces.  The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine.  On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion.  On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled "Beware, mines" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises.  Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground.  Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning.  He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer towards them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers.  "It is so hard to go through it all," said the 69-year-old," as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard.  Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. "They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'who you are, why you are out?'. The men were simply shot."  The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a "special military operation" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas.  Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: "This is not a special operation, these are not police actions... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians."

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo  BUCHAREST, April 4 (Reuters) - The United States will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Monday, after Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing dozens of civilians in the town of Bucha.  A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights.  "Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce," U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on a visit to Romania.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them."  Thomas-Greenfield said she wants to have the vote this week.  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with 140 votes in favour. Moscow says it is carrying out a "special operation" to demilitarise Ukraine.  "My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action," Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on a visit to Romania.  Russia's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Gennady Gatilov said that such an initiative would be unlikely to enjoy majority support.  "Washington exploits the Ukraine crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organisations, including the Human Rights Council here in Geneva," Gatilov said.  Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the 47-member council, which cannot make legally binding decisions but its decisions send important political messages and it can authorise investigations.  Last month it opened an investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine since Russia's invasion. Thirty-two members voted in favour of the resolution, brought by Ukraine. Russia and Eritrea voted against while 13, including China, abstained.  Bucha's deputy mayor said around 50 bodies found after Russian forces withdrew were the victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. read more  Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing those Bucha residents.  Ukrainian authorities said they were investigating possible war crimes there. The Kremlin denied accusations related to the murder of civilians in the town.  The United States has said war crimes have been committed in Ukraine and U.S. experts were gathering evidence to prove it.  The General Assembly has previously suspended a country from the council. In March 2011, it unanimously suspended Libya because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then leader Muammar Gaddafi.

The deaths in Bucha, outside Kyiv, looked set to galvanise the United States and Europe into additional sanctions against Moscow, possibly including some restrictions on the billions of dollars in energy that Europe still imports from Russia.  The discoveries overshadowed peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, due to restart on Monday against a backdrop of artillery bombardments in Ukraine's south and east, where Russia says it is now concentrating its operations.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on a visit to Bucha, adding it had become harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia since the scale of alleged atrocities emerged.  Taras Shapravskyi, deputy mayor of the town some 40 km (25 miles) northwest of Kyiv city, said around 50 victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops had been found there after Kremlin forces withdrew late last week. read more  Reuters saw one man sprawled by the roadside there, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head. Hands and feet poked through red clay at a mass grave by a church where satellite images showed a 45-foot-long trench. read more  The Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in the town, where it said the graves and corpses had been staged by Ukraine to tarnish Russia.  Ukrainian authorities said they had found 421 civilian casualties near Kyiv by Sunday and were investigating possible war crimes in Bucha, a description also used by French President Emmanuel Macron and, in reference to Russia's broader offensive, by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Reuters saw more makeshift burials elsewhere but could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible.  In the village or Motyzhyn west of Kyiv, its reporters saw three bodies in a forest grave. An adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry said the victims were the village's leader and her family.  Zelenskiy has used the term genocide at different times during the war, decrying what he calls an intent to eliminate the nation by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who has questioned Ukraine's legitimate, independent history from Russia.  FLATTENED BY SHELLING  On the other side of the country in Mariupol, a southern port that has been under siege for weeks, Reuters images showed three bodies in civilian clothes lying in the street, one against a wall sprayed with blood. Outside a damaged apartment building, residents buried other dead in a shell crater.  "It is easier to dig here," one resident said, saying four bodies were in the improvised grave. Nearby, the skeletal remains of residential tower blocks and other buildings surrounded by dust and debris dominated the skyline, Reuters images showed.  Ukraine says it has evacuated thousands of civilians in recent days from the city, which is surrounded by areas in the hands of Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region.  1/6 A Ukrainian service member inspects a compound of the Antonov airfield, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Hostomel, in Kyiv region, Ukraine April 3, 2022. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Read More  Several attempts by International Committee of the Red Cross teams to reach the besieged city in recent days have been unsuccessful, and a spokesman for the organisation said it was again unable to enter on Monday to evacuate civilians, a spokesperson said, citing security conditions.  Ukraine was preparing for what its general staff said were about 60,000 Russian reservists called in to reinforce the offensive there, while British military intelligence also said Russian troops, including contractors from the Wagner private military company, were moving to the east.  Reuters could not independently confirm the claims. Reuters correspondents saw convoys of armoured vehicles belonging to pro-Russia forces near Mariupol.  Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of eastern Luhansk region, said Russia was building up forces to break through Ukrainian defences.  "I am urging residents to evacuate. The enemy will not stop, it will destroy everything in its path," he said in comments carried on Ukrainian television.  SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN ENERGY?  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Russian President Vladimir Putin and his supporters would "feel the consequences" of events in Bucha.  Western allies would agree on further sanctions against Moscow in coming days, he said, though the timing and reach of the new package was not clear.  Germany's Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning Russian gas, though other officials urged caution around measures that could cause a European energy crisis. read more More than half of Germany's gas came from Russia last year.  France's Macron suggested sanctions on oil and coal, adding there were very "clear clues pointing to war crimes" by Russian forces.  As the U.N. Security Council prepared to discuss Ukraine on Tuesday, U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet told its Human Rights Council that strikes and heavy shelling during Russia's invasion had killed civilians in acts that might amount to war crimes.  The United States will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Rights Council, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov urged international leaders not to rush to judgment, telling reporters on Monday that the facts did not support Ukraine's version of events in Bucha.  Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a "special military operation" aimed at demilitarising and "denazifying" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.  Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of war crimes. France and Britain would support any such probe, their foreign ministers said.  However, legal experts say a prosecution of Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Additional reporting by Zohra Bensemra, Abdelaziz Boumzar and Simon Gardner in Bucha, Pavel Polityuk, Elizabeth Piper and Silvia Aloisi in Lviv, Issam Abdallah in Odesa, Natalia Zinets in Mukachevo, Lidia Kelly in Melbourne, Michelle Nichols at the UN, Max Hunder and Reuters bureaus in Europe and Washington Writing by Lincoln Feast and Frank Jack Daniel Editing by John Stonestreet  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko/File Photo  LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Military conscripts in the Russian-backed Donbas region have been sent into front-line combat against Ukrainian troops with no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons, six people in the separatist province told Reuters.  The new accounts of untrained and ill-equipped conscripts being deployed are a fresh indication of how stretched the military resources at the Kremlin's disposal are, over a month into a war that has seen Moscow's forces hobbled by logistical problems and held up by fierce Ukrainian resistance.  One of the people, a student conscripted in late February, said a fellow fighter told him to prepare to repel a close-quarter attack by Ukrainian forces in southwest Donbas but "I don't even know how to fire an automatic weapon."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The student and his unit fired back and evaded capture, but he was injured in a later battle. He did not say when the fighting took place.  While some information indicating poor conditions and morale among Donbas conscripts has emerged in social media and some local media outlets, Reuters was able to assemble one of the most comprehensive pictures to date.  Besides the student draftee, Reuters spoke to three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces.  Reuters verified the identity of the student, as well as the other sources and the draftees they are associated with. The news agency was unable to confirm independently the accounts of what happened to the men once they were drafted.  The six sources all asked that their full names not be published, saying that they feared reprisals for speaking to foreign media.  The Donbas armed forces are fighting alongside Russian soldiers but are not part of the Russian armed forces, which have different rules about which troops they send into combat.  Several Donbas draftees have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago, according to three people who saw conscripts from the separatist region using the weapon. Images shared on social media, that Reuters has not been able to verify independently, also showed Donbas fighters with Mosin rifles.  The student said he was forced to drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies. Two other sources in contact with draftees also told Reuters the men had to drink untreated water.  Some Donbas conscripts were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them, according to one of the sources and video testimony from a prisoner of war published by Ukrainian forces.  Asked to comment about the treatment and low morale of the Donbass draftees, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), the self-proclaimed separatist entity in Donbas. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  A spokeswoman for the DNR administration, after viewing Reuters questions, said there would be no response on Friday. She did not say when the administration would reply. Messages left with a spokesman for the separatist military went unanswered.  After being pushed to the front line near the port of Mariupol -- scene of the heaviest fighting in the war -- a group of about 135 Donbas conscripts laid down their arms and refused to fight on, according to Veronika, the partner of a conscript, who said her husband was among them. Marina, partner of another conscript, said she had been in contact with a friend who was part of the same group.  "We're refusing (to fight)," the friend wrote in a text message to Marina, seen by Reuters.  The men were kept in a basement by military commanders as punishment, Veronika and Marina said. Commanders verbally threatened them with reprisals but subsequently allowed the group out of the basement, pulled them back from the front line and billeted them in abandoned homes, Veronika said.  Neither the Kremlin nor separatist authorities answered Reuters questions about the incident.  CALL-UP  All sides in the Ukraine war have systems of conscription, where young men are required by law to do military service.  Ukraine's government has declared a general mobilisation, meaning that conscripts and reservists have been deployed to fight.  Russia says it is not deploying conscripts in Ukraine, though it has acknowledged a small number were mistakenly sent to fight. read more  The Donetsk separatist authorities announced in late February they were drafting all fighting age men for immediate deployment.  Military recruitment officers appeared at workplaces around the Donetsk region and told employees to report for duty, while police ordered people in the streets to report to their local draft office, according to a Reuters reporter who was there in late February. Anyone not complying risks prosecution.  Reuters could not determine how many people have been called up, nor what proportion of Donbas forces is comprised of draftees.  None of the five draftees had prior military experience or training, and four of the five were given no training before they were sent into combat, according to the injured draftee, the three wives of conscripted men, and the acquaintance.  "He never served in the army," said one of the partners, who gave her name as Olga and lives in the town of Makeevka. "He doesn't even really know how to hold an automatic weapon."  Two of the wives said their partners were deployed to the front line, where they saw heavy fighting.  "I'm in the war," read a text message, seen by Reuters, that Marina, also from Makeevka, said came from her drafted husband.  Marina said she learned from messages from her husband that his unit, fighting in the Donbas region, was ordered to draw enemy fire on to themselves.  Ukrainian forces on March 12 published a video showing a prisoner of war. He said his name was Ruslan Khalilov, that he was a civil servant from Donbas and that he was sent with zero training to Mariupol where his role was to draw enemy fire to facilitate the bombing of Ukrainian targets.  A person in Donbas who knows Khalilov confirmed to Reuters his identity, that he was drafted and has no military training. Reuters established that the person knows Khalilov.  "SLAUGHTERHOUSE"  The student draftee who spoke to Reuters said that a day after reporting for duty he was put in a mortar unit then sent towards the fighting. "We were taught nothing," he wrote to Reuters via messenger app.  "Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn't know how to do anything with them."  He said that before he left, his unit had been under repeated attack by Ukrainian troops. "There were lots of casualties," he wrote. "I hate the war. I don't want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?"  All the accounts gathered by Reuters mentioned an acute shortage of supplies. The sources described little or no safe drinking water, field rations for one man being shared among several, and units having to scavenge food.  "We drank water with dead frogs in it," said the student conscript.  "Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster," said the source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Neither the Kremlin nor the separatist authorities replied to Reuters’ questions about supplies and equipment for the draftees from Donbas.  WORLD WAR TWO RIFLE  The same source said some conscripts were issued with the Mosin rifle from reserve stocks that date back to the Second World War.  The student conscript said he has seen fellow fighters using the rifle: "It's like we're fighting with World War Two muskets."  A soldier in the Russian armed forces who is fighting near Mariupol told Reuters he had seen soldiers from the Donetsk separatist military carrying Mosin rifles.  A video posted on social media on Tuesday by Russian military journalist Semyon Pegov showed a man who said he was a Donbas draftee brandishing a Mosin rifle.  Soon after the men were drafted in late February, many of their wives, mothers, and sisters started writing petitions to the separatist leadership, to Donbas draft offices, and to the Kremlin, describing their treatment and seeking help.  "Bring us back our men," said one petition addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin, seen by Reuters.  The three wives of draftees who spoke to Reuters said they received no definitive answers.  On March 11, about 100 women gathered outside the separatist administration’s offices in Donetsk to demand answers, in a rare public show of dissent.  Two women who took part in the gathering said Alexander Malkovsky, the head of the DNR draft office, came out and told them that men aged 18 to 27 would be exempted from the draft. Reuters couldn't determine if this has been implemented, and was unable to reach Malkovsky.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  OSLO/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Russia maintained gas flows through key pipeline routes into Europe on Monday, despite uncertainty over payment terms and as European leaders urged further sanctions against Moscow amid allegations of war crimes in Ukraine.  Physical gas flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, at Germany's Mallnow border point see-sawed over the weekend and last stood at zero, data from operator Gascade showed.  Nominations, or requests, for Russian gas deliveries via Slovakia's Velke Kapusany entry point from Ukraine were steady on Monday at 967,954 MWh/day, as were flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany at73,379,286 kWh/h.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it was continuing to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with requests from European consumers.  However, questions remained over future deliveries in light of the Kremlin's demand that buyers start paying Gazprom in roubles.  Slovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger confirmed over the weekend that his country would act in unison with the European Union against such payment demands. read more  The discovery of a mass grave and civilians shot dead at close range in the Ukrainian city of Bucha outside Kyiv, from which Russian forces recently withdrew, has spurred calls for tougher sanctions on Russia. read more  Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes.

Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union after the United States and its allies imposed crippling sanctions due to Putin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.  Russia on Sunday denied its forces were responsible for the deaths of civilians in the town of Bucha and said Ukraine had staged a performance for the Western media.

The United States said that those responsible for any war crimes must be held responsible, Britain said it was stepping up its sanctions and France condemned "massive abuses" by Russian forces in Ukraine.  1/3 Squashed civilian cars are seen on a street, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in the town of Bucha, in Kyiv region, Ukraine April 1, 2022. REUTERS/Oleksandr Ratushniak Read More  SANCTIONS  The Kremlin says the West's sanctions - the most burdensome in modern history - amount to a declaration of economic war and that Moscow will now look eastwards to partners such as China and India.  Largely cut off from the West's economies, Russia is facing the biggest economic contraction for decades while prices are rising. Putin said that the West understands nothing about Russia if it thinks Russians will give in to sanctions.  Still, cutting off Russian gas - or more of Russia's natural resources - would wipe out growth in Europe's biggest economies, send energy prices to records and propel an inflationary shockwave through the global economy.  Russia, which has supplied gas to Europe since the 1970s, would be deprived of hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign currency earnings. It would likely toughen its response to the "economic war" of the West.  "The world is much bigger than Europe - and in fact Russia is much bigger than Europe - so sooner or later we will have a dialogue no matter what people across the ocean want," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Channel One state television.  Ukraine called for a full oil, gas and coal embargo, a ban on Russian vessels and cargos and the disconnection of all Russian banks from SWIFT.  Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people and displaced millions.  Putin says the "special military operation" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine.  Ukraine says Moscow launched a war of aggression and that Putin's claims of persecution are nonsense.

Global stocks stalled as investors kept an eye on the Ukraine conflict and for signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve on its monetary policy tightening plans.  A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, the gap between 2- and 10-year bond yields remained inverted, as a strong jobs report last week supported the view that the Fed would aggressively hike rates. An inverted yield curve is widely seen as a signal of incoming economic recession.  "While (the inversion is) bad news in the sense that it's a very accurate indicator of a recession, the good news is historically it's a buy signal versus a sell signal in the short term," said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.  "On average, the market tends to peak about a year to year-and-a-half after the 2/10 spread inverts."

REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo  Summary Orban's Fidesz wins two-thirds of parliament seats  Inflation surging, economy set to slow  EU funds frozen, tough talks ahead on Russia sanctions  Orban's stance on Russia distanced some eastern allies  BUDAPEST, April 4 (Reuters) - Emboldened by a fourth consecutive landslide election victory, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to dig in against energy sanctions on Russia and toughen his stance in talks with Brussels to unlock frozen EU funds.  Nationalist Orban, who held on to his sweeping majority on Sunday, crushing the opposition despite efforts to unite against him, will likely continue to reject any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas, arguing they would wreck an economy already slowing due to the impacts of the Ukraine war.  Using his strong mandate, Orban will also entrench his conservative policies at home and could attempt to squeeze out foreign companies in some sectors like retail where Hungarian ownership is still not dominant, as his Fidesz party aims to form its own class of loyal industrialists.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But Orban faces some tough challenges: he needs to mend relations with his eastern allies like Poland, strained by his cautious stance on the Ukraine war after a decade of close business ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  He also has to rein in a swelling budget deficit at a time when the Hungarian economy is set to slow due to supply chain disruptions in the car sector.  Unlocking recovery funds withheld by Brussels could play a key role in fixing the budget, so Orban is expected to fight for that, but it could be a lengthy process.  The EU has suspended payments to both Poland and Hungary from its pandemic recovery funds over perceived democratic shortcomings, which economists say could begin exerting pressure on Budapest and Warsaw from the second half of the year, barring a compromise. read more  "The expectation that there could be a relatively quick agreement with the European Commission (on EU funds) is questionable now after in his speech last night Viktor Orban took a repeated swipe at Brussels," said Peter Virovacz at ING in Budapest.  "We can hardly expect that his government, with two-thirds majority now, will be as ready for a compromise as it would have been with a simple majority win in elections."  Pre-election surveys had pointed to a much closer race.  Surrounded by leading party members, a triumphant Orban, 58, said Sunday's victory came even with Brussels bureaucrats and the international mainstream media all teaming up against him.  "We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon, but definitely from Brussels," he said. read more  SUPER-MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT  Based on preliminary results, Fidesz will have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority in parliament, with 56 seats going to the opposition alliance.  His critics say the victory could embolden Orban in what they say is an erosion of democratic norms, media freedom and the rights of LGBTQ people.  "Without wanting to sound overly dramatic, it’s a tragedy. Looks like the end of whatever dreams one might have had of democracy in Hungary," an EU official said.  "We'd have to cut money transfers so that he doesn't build his own oligarchy with our money."  In Poland, Orban's re-election was welcome with mixed feelings among the ruling nationalists.  "Putin is a long-term threat also for Hungary and whoever doesn't see that is making a big mistake," Polish deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz said on Monday.  In bright sunshine after Sunday's snowfall, some residents in Budapest, which remains an opposition stronghold with the alliance winning in 16 of 18 constituencies, remained hopeful.  "We are not happy. I would like to stay in Europe but I hope we will stay in Europe somehow this way too," said Janos Varadi.  Others said Orban's positioning on Ukraine, accusing the opposition of risking Hungary being dragged into the war by seeking to allow arms shipments through its territory, played into their choice.  "I did not hope for such a big victory but I was sure that the present government party would win," said Veronika Nagy, a language teacher. "I think it is due to how the parties reacted to the war, perhaps the ... opposition made people uncertain."  One of Europe's longest-serving leaders, Orban has emerged as a vocal supporter of anti-immigration policies and was especially popular with voters in rural areas who espouse his traditional Christian values and with families who benefit from a host of tax breaks and price caps on fuel and some foodstuffs.  With inflation running at an almost 15-year high of 8.3% in February, Orban will have a tough task in unwinding some of his measures that had helped tame price growth in the run-up to the vote.

REUTERS/Yves Herman  Summary Finnish President asked NATO chief how to join; Sweden more hesitant  NATO sees both countries as partners  Living memories of war kept Finns on alert, Swedes less prepared  Finnish politicians tour NATO capitals to gauge support  Moscow has threatened "serious consequences" if countries join  BARDUFOSS, Norway, April 4 (Reuters) - The sound of gunfire echoed around the Norwegian fjords as a row of Swedish and Finnish soldiers, positioned prone behind banks of snow, trained rifles and missile launchers on nearby hills ready for an enemy attack.  The drill, in March, was the first time forces from Finland and Sweden have formed a combined brigade in a scheduled NATO exercise in Arctic Norway known as "Cold Response." Neither country is a member of the NATO alliance. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game.  "We would be rather naive not to recognise that there is a threat," Swedish Major Stefan Nordstrom told Reuters. "The security situation in the whole of Europe has changed and we have to accept that, and we have to adapt."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  That sense of threat means President Vladimir Putin, who embarked on what he calls a "special operation" in Ukraine partly to counter the expansion of the NATO alliance, may soon have a new NATO neighbour.  Finland has a 1,300 km (810 mile) border with Russia. In a March 28 phone call, the country's President Sauli Niinisto asked NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for details on principles and steps for accepting new members, he wrote on Facebook. Finland's leaders have discussed possible membership with "almost all" NATO's 30 members, and will submit a review to parliament by mid-April, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told Reuters.  Sweden – home of the founder of the Nobel Peace Prize and a country which has not fought in a war since 1814 – is more hesitant. But a recent opinion poll for a major Swedish TV station found 59% of Swedes wanted to join NATO, if Finland does.  For some in the alliance, the two countries sandwiched between Russia and NATO-member Norway are already partners. U.S. General David Berger, who is the commandant of the U.S. Marines Corps, told reporters at the drill that – putting the politics of membership aside – they were brothers-in-arms during training.  "For marines, at the tactical level ... there's no difference," Berger said. "I just have to know that the unit over there, they have my back. They've got me covered."  Stoltenberg announced in early March that NATO was now sharing all information on the war in Ukraine with Sweden and Finland. Both countries regularly attend NATO meetings. At the exercises in Norway, Stoltenberg said "no other countries in the world" are closer partners.  But he noted an important difference: "The absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies."  As non-members, Finland and Sweden's combined population of 16 million don't have the protection of NATO's guarantee that an attack on one ally is an attack on all.  Moscow did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It has repeatedly warned both countries against joining NATO. On March 12, the Russian foreign ministry said "there will be serious military and political consequences" if they do, according to Russian news agency Interfax.  Stoltenberg has said it would be possible to allow Finland and Sweden in "quite quickly." NATO has not commented on what a fast-track process would be; a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said any decision would be taken by the countries themselves but their accession would need to be agreed by all 30 allies.  "President Putin wants less NATO on Russia's borders," Stoltenberg said in January, also referring to more allied troops in southeastern Europe, Poland and the Baltics. "But he is getting more NATO."  MEMORIES OF WAR  More than 1,000 km to the southeast of the NATO drill, 80-year-old Markku Kuusela knows real war. The pensioner, who lives in Imatra, a town on Finland's border with Russia, was evacuated to Sweden with his brother as an infant after his father was killed fighting a Russian invasion.  They returned to Finland only after the war was over.  "It is always in the back of my mind," said Kuusela, visiting the cemetery where his father is buried. Tears welled in his eyes. "How it would have been to have a father."  Some 96,000 Finns, or 2.5% of the population, died fighting the Russian invasion, in two wars between 1939 and 1944. A total of 55,000 children lost fathers and over 400,000 people lost homes as territory was conceded.  But the Finns, fighting under cover of dense forest, repelled the Russians and ever since, Finland has had a clear goal: strong defence and friendly relations with Russia.  The country built a conscript army – it has about 900,000 men and women in reserves – and according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, one of the largest artilleries in Europe.  For years, Finns and Russians have interacted extensively. This year, Imatra was planning to celebrate a 250-year history of Finnish tourism since a visit by Catherine the Great, the Russian empress, in 1772.  Now the Imatra border station is deserted, its stalls unused. Finland's security service, known as Supo, says Russia's military resources are currently focused on Ukraine and its own domestic operations, but warns the situation may change quickly.  The Ukraine invasion triggered almost 3,000 applications from Finns to join local associations of reservists as well as almost 1,000 to women's emergency preparedness groups, the groups said.  One applicant was Pia Lumme, a 48-year-old coordinator for the Finnish National Agency for Education who lives near Imatra. She recalled her grandmother's war memories.  "I think we Finns all share ... the will to uphold this country," Lumme said.  Finland is one of few European countries to maintain a national emergency supply of fuel, food and medicine. Building emergency shelters beneath every major building has been mandatory since World War Two. The country says its 54,000 shelters have room for 4.4 million of the 5.5 million population.  Finns' backing for joining NATO has risen to record numbers over the past month, with the latest poll by public broadcaster Yle showing 62% of respondents in favour and only 16% against.  Supo, the security service, said on March 29 Finland must guard against potential Russian retaliation to Helsinki's discussions on joining NATO, or interference in the public debate.  "We don't need to make any quick decisions on our own defence, but certainly a possible membership application could lead to making us a target of interference or hybrid actions," Haavisto told Reuters in an interview. "Finland needs to prepare for that and also listen to how NATO countries would react."  CRISIS KITS  Sweden, which has argued that non-alignment has served its people well, has been slower to see Russia as a threat – for example, it allowed defence spending to slip and emergency shelters to fall into disrepair after the Cold War. But the mood there is also changing.  After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the government speeded up rearmament and boosted military strength on the island of Gotland, near the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. It also reintroduced limited conscription that year.  Stockholm said earlier this month it would almost double defence spending to around 2% of GDP and is refurbishing a network of emergency bunkers, to shelter up to seven million people. It says there are currently around 65,000 shelters, mostly in private homes.  Around 71% of Swedes are worried about an increased military threat from Russia – up from 46% in January – according to a survey by pollsters Demoskop for daily Aftonbladet on March 2.  Three retail chains told Reuters sales of products to prepare for emergencies had accelerated again after picking up at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  "Sales of crisis kits, wind-up radios, water filters and water containers - pretty much everything - have increased," said Fredrik Stockhaus, founder of Criseq, a Swedish online store. Sweden's statistics office does not measure sales at this level of detail.  If either country does go for NATO membership, Finland looks set to move first, diplomats and politicians say. Foreign Minister Haavisto said he is in "almost daily" talks with his Swedish counterpart on the topic.  "It wouldn't be ideal for Finland to go alone, because then all the risks in the application process would be on Finland," said Matti Pesu, a foreign policy analyst at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.  In Sweden, the government and opposition are conducting an analysis of security policy which is expected in May. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson stressed on national TV on March 30 it was important to wait and see what conclusions that reaches. The ruling Social Democrats oppose joining, but four opposition parties support it.  Even so, Sweden's non-aligned status is increasingly blurred, said Anna Wieslander, Northern Europe Director at the Atlantic Council think-tank.  "If you look at it, we are preparing to meet the adversary together and I think there is no doubt in which camp we are," she said. "You can see the warnings Russia has given so there is no doubt on their side as well."

Picture taken March 21, 2022. REUTERS/Layli Foroudi  Summary Yachts detained by France, Spain, Germany and Italy  Running costs can run into millions of dollars per month  Liability for costs depends on a vessel's legal status  LA CIOTAT, France, April 4 (Reuters) - In a quiet corner of the French Riviera, La Ciotat Shipyards said it is writing bills for mooring fees for the towering white superyacht Amore Vero, but it doesn't know who to send them to.  Customs agents seized the 86-metre (282-ft) vessel as its crew prepared to sail out of harbour on the night of March 2, two days after the European Union added Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft, to its sanctions list for the war in Ukraine.  France's finance ministry says the yacht belongs to a company controlled by Sechin - one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's oldest allies. The ministry declined to name the firm.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But Sechin - in a statement sent to Reuters by Rosneft - denied this.  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France had officially seized the Amore Vero - a measure that officials said gives the state custody over the yacht and leaves costs with the owner.  But authorities have not notified third parties of the vessel's status, leaving it unclear who is responsible for its upkeep, said two companies involved in servicing the yacht. As bills pile up, an executive at La Ciotat Shipyards said the company was unsure how to get paid.  "We're continuing to invoice," said Alice Boisseau, communications officer for La Ciotat Shipyards. Asked who would foot the bill, she said: "We don't know."  Boisseau declined to answer further questions. France's customs agency declined to comment on why it had not informed the shipyards of the yacht's status.  The questions hanging over the Amore Vero point to the complexities authorities face as they target the assets of Putin's allies, and the disruption being brought to some businesses.  In the European Union, oligarchs' financial wealth remains largely untouched read more , but European states have frozen or seized physical assets, including properties and at least 11 superyachts.  John Dalby, owner of Marine Risk Management, which recovers maritime assets on behalf of insurers and banks, said Mediterranean governments had little experience in the legal intricacies of seizing superyachts.  "There's a lack of cohesion in what people are doing: between state actors and other third parties, like creditors," Dalby said, adding that he had spoken with authorities in the Mediterranean and the United States.  He said that creditors of seized yachts - such as fuel suppliers or crew management firms - could ask a court to sell the vessel to recoup their debts. France's customs agency did not comment.  OWNERSHIP  Russians own nearly one in every 10 superyachts, according to specialist website Superyacht Times.  Some of those owned by sanctioned individuals are moored in safe havens - such as Roman Abramovich's Eclipse and Solaris in Turkey - or are sailing in international waters beyond the jurisdict of sanction-imposing states.  The Amore Vero had been in port in France undergoing a refit by luxury yacht specialist MB92 when sanctions were imposed, Le Maire said.  Authorities had seized rather than merely 'frozen' the Amore Vero because its attempt to leave port contravened the EU sanctions regime and broke French law, the minister said.  MB92, asked if it had received full payment for the refit or whether it expected to do so, told Reuters: "We are still waiting for formal notification from Customs that will clarify the official status of the vessel."  Maritime lawyer Pascal Flot said difficulties determining the ownership of megayachts might be one reason why French authorities had not notified third parties of the Amore Vero's status.  The super-rich often control their assets through a web of shell companies in offshore tax havens, Flot said. The Amore Vero flies under a Cayman Islands flag.  The customs office declined to comment.  "NASTY SURPRISES"  The annual running costs of the biggest superyachts can amount to 10% of their value, Flot said, including the crew's salary, repairs, fuel, food, insurance, berth fees and onshore utilities.  For a vessel like the $540 million Sailing Yacht A, owned by coal and fertilizer baron Andrei Melnichenko and detained in the Italian port of Trieste, that could mean millions of dollars each month. read more  In Italy, frozen assets are managed by a publicly appointed administrator and maintenance expenses are borne by the state property agency. They must later be reimbursed by the owner or the state can sell the asset to recoup its expenses.  Italy's Agenzia del Demanio declined to comment. Representatives for Melnichenko did not reply to a request for comment.  In France and in Spain, the running costs of a 'frozen' or seized yacht remain the owner's responsibility. However, blocks on their bank accounts meant that sanctioned owners were often unable to make payment, said Rachel Lynch of the seafarer union Nautilus International.  Another risk for governments lay in vessels wrongly detained, said Giannis Markogiannis, a Greek lawyer specialised in international yachting law, insurance and taxation.  A seized yacht whose ownership could not be linked to a name on the sanctions list had to be released, leaving the state liable for any deterioration in condition or damage during its immobilisation, he said. Owners might also sue for loss of charter earnings or for prohibition of use.  "All those matters need to be carefully dealt with by the seizing state to avoid nasty surprises." Markogiannis said.

Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv last week, Ukrainian troops have been moving in, showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt out cars.  Reuters could not independently verify who killed the family in the grave just outside Motyzhyn, west of Kyiv. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and has said similar reports of killings were "staged" to sully Russia's name. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head," said Anton Herashchenko, naming those killed as Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son, Oleksandr.  "The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery. These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be responsible for this."  A Reuters reporter saw the bodies in a forest near a farm, which had been all but destroyed, just outside the village of Motyzhyn. Nearby a burnt out tractor could be seen and one of those buried in the sand had his head taped.  The reporter also saw another body of a man in a well near to the burnt out farm, where black scorch marks climbed up its few remaining walls. He appeared to have been tied up.  Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbours Motyzhyn, told Reuters the family had been taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before the troops left.  "The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined," he said by telephone.  Global outrage spread on Monday over civilian deaths in Ukraine including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops, as artillery bombarded the country's south and east.  Reuters reporters saw on Sunday several corpses by the roadside in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, one had his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. read more  On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said in a statement all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging crimes by Russian troops in Bucha were a "provocation" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops.

Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday they were investigating possible crimes by Russian forces after finding hundreds of bodies strewn around towns outside the capital Kyiv after the Russian withdrawal from the area.  "This information must be seriously questioned," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes."  Peskov said that the facts and chronology of the events in Bucha did not support Ukraine's version of events and urged international leaders not to rush to judgment.  "We categorically deny any accusations," said Peskov.  "The situation is undoubtedly serious and we would ask that many international leaders not rush with their statements, not rush with their baseless accusations, request information from different sources, and at least listen to our explanations."  Peskov said that Russia's diplomats would press on with their efforts to convene a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss what Moscow has called "Ukrainian provocations" in Bucha despite their first effort to arrange such a meeting being blocked.  "The initiative itself of raising this topic to the platform of the U.N. Security Council suggests that Russia wants and demands that this topic be raised at the international level," Peskov said.  Peskov declined to comment on whether the furore over Bucha would affect peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which had been set to resume via video conference on Monday.  Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Michel Euler/Pool via REUTERS  Summary  Summary Companies Dimon concerned about secondary impact of Ukraine conflict  Dimon calls for increased U.S. military presence in Europe  Dimon urges revamp of U.S. supply chain  Fed rate hikes could be higher than market expects -Dimon  NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) could lose about $1 billion on its Russia exposure, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Monday, detailing the extent of the bank's potential losses from the conflict in Ukraine for the first time.  In his keenly watched annual letter to shareholders, the chairman and chief executive of the biggest U.S. bank by assets also urged the United States to increase its military presence in Europe and reiterated a call for it to develop a plan to ensure energy security for itself and its allies.  Dimon did not provide a time frame for JPMorgan's potential Russia losses but said the bank was concerned about the secondary impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on companies and countries. Russia calls its actions a "special operation."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Global banks have detailed their exposure to Russia in recent weeks but Dimon is the most high-profile world business leader yet to comment on the broader impact of the conflict.  "America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best," he wrote. (For five key takeaways from Dimon's letter, click on read more )  Dimon may continue as chairman when he eventually relinquishes his role as chief executive, the bank said Monday.  The disclosure, in a report to shareholders ahead of JPMorgan's annual meeting in May, said the bank had found that most major shareholders want Dimon to remain chairman.  The board also said that it was inclined as a "general policy" to separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive after Dimon is gone. Many shareholders have a general preference to separate the posts, it said.  Dimon has made something of a joke of perpetually saying he will resign in five years. In 2019, he said the five-year clock had actually begun.  In his letter to shareholders, Dimon addressed the relationship between the United States and China and said the United States should revamp its supply chain to restrict its scope to suppliers within the United States or to only include "completely friendly allies". He urged the United States to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.  Commenting on the macroeconomic environment, Dimon said the number of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes "could be significantly higher than the market expects." He also detailed the bank's rising expenses, in part due to technology investments and acquisition costs.  The letter is Dimon's 17th as CEO. While Dimon is not the only CEO of a top U.S. bank to write such letters, his have become must-reads among Wall Street's elite and policymakers for the view they provide into his political and economic ideas.  'FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET'  This year's letter comes as the Russia-Ukraine war and high inflation are hurting the economy, and as Dimon faces new skepticism from investors over expenses.  Some question his plans to increase spending on the bank's information technology and campaigns to take market share in businesses and geographies where JPMorgan currently trails competitors, such as in Germany and the United Kingdom.  JPMorgan decided earlier this year to hold its first investor day since the pandemic began to address doubts about its spending plans. The meeting will be held on May 23.  Dimon has spent more than a decade building what he calls the bank's "fortress balance sheet," and he said it is now robust enough that JPMorgan could withstand losses of $10 billion or more and "still be in very good shape."  While Dimon wrote that he is not worried about the bank's exposure to Russia, he said the war in Ukraine will slow the global economy and will impact geopolitics for decades.  "We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against Russia," he said.  On acquisitions, Dimon said that the bank will be reducing stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules "and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our company."  JPMorgan has been on a buying spree, spending nearly $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months. Dimon said that will increase "incremental investment expenses" by roughly $700 million this year.  Investments in technology will add $2 billion to expenses this year, Dimon said.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo  MEDYKA/BORATYN, Poland April 4 (Reuters) - Five weeks after the start of the fighting in Ukraine, Kamil Prusinowski and his small band of volunteers are exhausted at their refugee shelter over the border in Poland.  Supplies, funding and energy are all running low, Prusinowski said in a room filled with children's toys, stuffed animals and footballs in the centre housed in a former school in the village of Boratyn.  "We are just bleeding out," the 37-year-old added. "We just require the proper institutional help to support all of these people."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled abroad since the start of what Russia calls its "special operation" in Ukraine, U.N. agencies say.  Almost 2.5 million of them have crossed into Poland and more are still arriving - though the numbers have slowed since the start of the war, according to Poland's border guard service.  With mattresses lying on the floor, children and their mothers waited for medical attention at the centre run by the recently formed UNITATEM foundation.  Inés Jorge de Figueiredo, a 34-year-old doctor from Portugal, said she had ibuprofen and other basic supplies, but was desperately short of treatments for chronic conditions including hypertension and diabetes.  "The people need help. The need is changing, but we need to be here and our organisation is struggling to get another team (of doctors to come through)," she said.  Aid groups need cash to pay their electricity, water, food bills she added. Staff there need "help to pay (for) our car to go from one centre to the other centre."  Around a dozen aid workers in Boratyn, at the Przemysl train station and at the Medyka border crossing told Reuters they were tired and struggling with rain, snow, sub-zero temperatures and dwindling resources.  A Polish government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on requests for more state aid.  "WE GET USED TO EVERYTHING"  Agencies at Medyka said they were trying to get more volunteers, so they could give existing workers more time off.  Some said they had already started bringing in people for just a week or two weeks at a time, before giving them a break and flying in replacements from abroad.  Volunteers hid under rain ponchos and dripping tents, venturing out occasionally to offer refugees pizza, fries and hot drinks.  "People are coming with really critical needs that need to be addressed," Shabia Mantoo, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, said.  "So it's really important for the international community to support the national responses, humanitarian actors and others that are on the ground."  Lillian Boulard, 49, who drove a car-load of supplies from his home in Bordeaux at the beginning of the conflict and now organises regular aid convoys from France, said supplies would run out if bigger organisations did not step in.  "The events (in Ukraine) have overtaken the NGOs (non-governmental organisations). They're not here. Or only very little," he said.  Refugees said they were doing their part.  "We're trying to help here with cleaning and keeping the place tidy," said Kateryna Rogachova, originally from Velyka Dymerka in Ukraine's Kyiv Oblast region.  Standing next to shelves full of clothes and plastic packs of water bottles, Rogachova said the work was helping her to adjust.  "We go to other similar institutions and help there as well. We paint the walls, fold cloths, help unload the groceries," the 49-year-old said. "Little by little, we get used to everything."

Roughly 21.7 million U.S. households use food stamps, which are mostly restricted payments to cold food items, non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants.  Target disclosed to Reuters last week that it will begin to accept payment online with food stamps, tentatively starting in late April, through a service offered by Shipt, its delivery arm. A Target spokesman said Thursday that it hadn't "shared any official launch date" for the service, which also will include drive-up and pick-up orders.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Offering food-stamp payment for online orders could help Target fill a long-time gap in its e-commerce strategy and reach households that might otherwise purchase groceries at so-called "dollar store" chains, or at Walmart Inc (WMT.N).  Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) already accept purchases with food stamps on their websites since 2019 as part of a program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which distributes food stamps. Grocery delivery service Instacart also offers the option.  Still, even though Target has lost the early mover advantage, investors and industry watchers were positive on the move. Accepting food-stamp payments online could build customer loyalty and help it sell other products, said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds over $30 million in Target shares.  "Target is kind of taking the long view, saying you can use your food stamps now," he said. "But maybe at some point you won't depend on food stamps and you'll remember that Target was there for your various shopping needs."  "I wouldn't call it a game-changer, but I think it is important," Klink added.  Grocery is a big part of Target's operations. In 2020, it accounted for 20% of its overall sales of $92.4 billion, putting it in competition with the 10 largest U.S. grocers, including Kroger (KR.N) and Albertsons (ACI.N). The company this month said it was looking to expand grocery sales, especially through private label.  On March 1, Richard Gomez, Target's chief food and beverage officer, told investors Target is "going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries."  Target's house brand, Good & Gather, now offers nearly 2,500 food and beverage products. Target, for example, sells a 12-ounce can of Good & Gather evaporated milk for $0.99 on its website, compared to Nestle's Carnation condensed milk for $1.69.  "Target will put a leading national brand like Nestle on a display, but put the Target (private-label) item right next to it, to get the consumer to cross over," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm, adding that the move was "transformative."  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in October began providing about 42.8 million people with an additional $20 billion in food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than 3.2 million food-stamp households shopped online in January, doubling from a year before. To buy groceries online, food-stamp recipients generally must have an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card, similar to a debit card. However card holders can't use the benefits to pay for non-food items.  For Target, one question is whether food-stamp recipients will be willing to pay delivery fees. Shipt, which Target acquired in 2017, charges $7 per delivery but offers free same-day delivery to subscribers who pay $99 per year.  Instacart, which handles deliveries for BJ's Wholesale Club, Food Lion, Publix and Ahold Delhaize USA, among others, is waiving its $3.99 delivery fees for food stamp purchases made online until March 31.  Amazon has since offered additional discounts of up to 15%on select meat, produce, toiletries and paper products purchased at Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods by food stamp recipients using EBT cards.  EBT cards can not be used to pay for Amazon Prime subscription membership, tips or items sold by third-party sellers; however, Amazon offers membership discounts of $6.99 per month for customers who are on government programs including SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid. An Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month, or $139 per year.  Lower-income households are seeing their purchasing power erode as meat and bread prices, and heating and gas costs, rise. The price of groceries purchased online in the United States rose 7.6% on average in February, compared to a year earlier, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index.  The $50 billion or more that Americans spend annually on groceries purchased with food stamps represents just 5% of the $1 trillion spent on food-at-home yearly, said Bill Kirk, consumer analyst at MKM Partners.

The editor, Marina Ovsyannikova, told Reuters earlier this month that she hoped her protest would open Russians' eyes to propaganda. read more  But his mother said the protest looked fake, as if it had been staged with a green screen, according to Nokhrin.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It is an example of how Russian Americans are sending their relatives in Russia accounts of the war in Ukraine produced by Western and other media outlets that contrast with what Russian state media is reporting. Reuters interviews with 11 Russian Americans suggest that, as with the case of Nokhrin's mother, skepticism about the war in Ukraine runs deep.  "The propaganda there works very well," said Nokhrin, a 37-year-old IT entrepreneur. "They've been told that this is a peacemaking operation and they truly, honestly believe it."  State TV, the main source of news for many millions of Russians, closely follows the Kremlin line that Russia was forced to act in Ukraine to demilitarize and "denazify" the country, and to defend Russian-speakers there against what the Kremlin calls "genocide."  Russia passed a law earlier this month banning the "public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation." Offenders face up to 15 years in jail. read more  Russian state TV did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Kremlin declined to comment.  Russian Americans interviewed by Reuters said they are engaging in conversations with family over messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram, sharing material they collect from social media and international news sites.  Nokhrin has sent his relatives pictures of injured Ukrainian children, dead Russian soldiers, and bombed-out apartment buildings and hospitals. He sent his mother the link to a news site that aggregates content about Ukraine from international news sites and translates them into Russian. He used WhatsApp to message his mother a YouTube clip of Russia's independent news broadcaster, TV Rain, signing off with "No to war."  Reuters has seen the messages sent by Nokhrin and others interviewed for this story and verified the sources of the videos and pictures they included. Reuters was unable to interview the relatives in Russia to verify the conversations.  "This military operation has been presented to them as if there were Ukrainian fascists that are trying to enslave the Russian population," Nokhrin said. "My mom, she thinks (President Volodymyr) Zelenskiy is this evil monster who wants to join NATO, which wants to nuke Russia."  1/2 Russian President Vladimir Putin appears on a screen at the White House briefing room during a TV broadcast, signing documents recognizing separatist areas of Ukraine as independent, in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2022. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Read More  "It's crazy for us to think of this, since we see the other side of this, but when you are isolated in Russia and just seeing government media it really informs what you believe."  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in the past that the United States is an "empire of lies" that sows disinformation about Russia. Senior Russian officials such as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov say Western media has misreported the conflict in Ukraine and has repeatedly failed to show the persecution of Russian-speaking people there.  Julia Bari, a New York City-based insurance broker who emigrated from Moscow 26 years ago, described a cousin's reluctance to engage in a fraught discussion about what was happening in Ukraine.  Bari said she is frequently in touch over WhatsApp with the cousin living in southwestern Russia. After the invasion, "I called her to say, 'Oh my God, war is happening,' and she shut me down. She said, 'Look, we don't know anything. This is politics.' I became quiet because my insides were boiling from anger."  Bari sent her cousin what she could find: pictures of Ukrainian children sleeping in bomb shelters, videos of buildings being hit by artillery strikes, photos of orphans being evacuated on trains.  "I told her, you know, this is real. This is murder," Bari said. "She said that it was unpleasant to see but she couldn't be involved with it. She wants to act like everything is normal."  International reaction to the invasion has been severe and includes sweeping sanctions that have sent the rouble plunging to record lows and left Russians isolated. read more  Bari said she is concerned for her cousin, whose salary with one of Russia's largest state-owned companies was recently cut by 60%, according to Bari. She declined to name the company.  "She thinks (Russia) can switch to its own production lines or get whatever they need from China," Bari said. "I'm scared for her."  After leaving Moscow in 2018, Sasha and Vitaly, a couple in their mid-30s who asked that their last names not be used out of concern for the safety of their family, started a WhatsApp chat with their relatives. Until three weeks ago, their content was mostly pictures of their two young children. These days, they send news updates and videos about the invasion.  Vitaly's mother, who works in healthcare in Moscow, reads the stories he sends her from independent Russian news sources that post on Telegram.  "She would bring up the war with her colleagues, and they'd say, 'You think this way because your son is in America and has brainwashed you. That's why you're not supporting President Putin,'" Vitaly said in an interview at a café in Portland, Oregon. Vitaly's mother, he said, was open to the idea of seeing the invasion of Ukraine as an atrocity.  However, since Russia passed the law on information dissemination, Vitaly said his mother, at his request, has stopped talking to colleagues about the war, for fear she could be accused of spreading falsehoods.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo  WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday was poised to vote on President Joe Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson in the next hurdle on her journey toward confirmation, with a potential tie looming on a panel evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.  Even with the possible 11-11 committee deadlock, Jackson's nomination still would proceed to the full Senate, with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer already saying the chamber was on track to confirm the federal appellate court judge to the lifetime post before its planned Easter recess begins on Friday.  If confirmed, Jackson would become the first Black woman to serve on the top U.S. judiciary body, joining the liberal bloc on a court with a 6-3 conservative majority. During her confirmation hearing before the panel last month, Biden's fellow Democrats expressed support for Jackson while Republicans signaled opposition with a spree of hostile questions.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman, noted in his opening statement ahead of the vote that the panel voted to confirm Jackson to three previous posts. Durbin said Jackson has impeccable qualifications and he lamented what he called baseless attacks by some Republicans.  "They repeatedly interrupted and badgered Judge Jackson and accused her of vile things in front of her parents, her husband and her children. There was table-pounding - some literal - from a few of my colleagues. They repeated discredited claims about Judge Jackson's character," Durbin said.  Several Republican senators used the confirmation hearings to accuse her of being lenient on child pornography offenders during her time as a federal trial court judge. Jackson defended her record, saying she did her "duty to hold the defendants accountable." Sentencing experts called the penalties she imposed within the mainstream among federal judges, while American Bar Association witnesses rejected claims that Jackson was "soft on crime."  With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, Jackson would get the job if Democrats remain united regardless of how the Republicans vote. Biden's fellow Democrats control the Senate because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote.  Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee's top Republican, called Jackson "very personable and engaging" but complained that more documents on her judicial record should have been released and took issue with the nominee on a number of matters.  "Having carefully studied her record, unfortunately, I think she and I have fundamentally different views on the roles of judges and the role that they should play in our system of government. Because of those disagreements I cannot support her nomination," Grassley said.  During her confirmation hearings, Jackson, 51, pledged independence if confirmed and embraced a limited role for jurists. She also reflected on opportunities she has had that her parents, who grew up in era of racial segregation in the South, did not. read more  Senator Susan Collins, not a member of the committee, last Wednesday became the only Republican to announce support for Jackson while also calling the current judicial confirmation process too politicized. read more  The committee's tally is expected to be a deadlock after Senator Lindsay Graham, its sole Republican to vote to confirm Jackson last June for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said he would vote no this time. Graham on Monday again aired grievances about how Democrats treated previous Republican Supreme Court nominees, while accusing Jackson of being evasive during her confirmation hearings and giving answers that he said indicated she would be an activist judge molding her rulings to her own beliefs.  A tied committee vote would not block Jackson's nomination, as Democrats would be expected to hold a vote on the Senate floor that would let it proceed. Democrats expect a final Senate confirmation vote on Thursday or Friday.  Jackson, if confirmed, would replace retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.

In closing arguments on Friday, a government prosecutor described the men as "paranoid" and bent on sparking a civil war by abducting Whitmer and holding her accountable for placing restrictions on social and business activities due to COVID-19.  Defense attorneys, on the other hand, said their clients were coerced into discussing the plot by FBI informants and never made concrete plans on their own.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The case stands as one of the most high-profile prosecutions of alleged members of right-wing organizations that have risen in prominence in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. It also highlights the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.  All four of the defendants - Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris - have been charged with kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison.  "They trained to kidnap the governor, they cased her house in the middle of the night, they mapped it out, they planned it, they gathered weapons and bombs," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said on Friday in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. "That is the conspiracy that they are charged with and in America it's a crime."  Defense attorneys accused the FBI of entrapping their clients.  "Somebody rattles the keys, somebody beats the drum and gets 'em all worked up," Christopher Gibbons, an attorney for Fox, said on Friday. "That’s unacceptable in America. That’s not how it works. You don’t make terrorists so we can arrest them."  Two other men initially charged in the alleged plot struck plea deals. The pair, Ty Garbin and Kalen Franks, served as star witnesses for the prosecution. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks is awaiting sentencing.  The four men on trial are among 13 men who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.  The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. The group's goal was to end curbs on social and business activities imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Prosecutors have also accused them of wanting to start a second American civil war.  Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the "Three Percenters," a similar far-right organization.

REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare/File Photo  WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Americans living in poorer counties died during the pandemic at almost twice the rate of those in rich counties, a study released Monday by the Poor People's Campaign showed.  The study, based on income and death data from over 3,200 U.S. counties, shows an even bigger gap during the Delta variant that made up the U.S.'s fourth coronavirus wave, when people living in the lowest income counties died at five times the rate of those in the highest income counties.  The 300 counties with the highest death rates have an average poverty rate of 45%, and household median incomes on average $23,000 lower than counties with lower rates. Many of the top twenty counties were sparsely populated areas in Georgia, Texas and Virginia, the report and an accompanying map of death rates and income online show.

The United States is the only wealthy nation not to guarantee health services for all, and witnessed the biggest decline in male life expectancy during the COVID-pandemic of 29 nations studied by Oxford University.  More than 980,000 Americans have died of COVID, the most of any country in the world.

The city began its two-stage lockdown on March 28, initially in Shanghai's eastern districts, and later expanded to cover the whole city.  The curbs, which have massively disrupted daily life and business operations in China's financial hub, were initially scheduled to end at 5 a.m. local time (9 p.m. GMT) on Tuesday.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The city will continue to implement seal and control management and strictly implement 'staying at home', except for medical treatment," the city government said on its official WeChat account.  It did not give an indication of when the curbs might lift.  The country sent the military and thousands of healthcare workers into Shanghai to help carry out COVID-19 tests for all of its 26 million residents on Monday, in one of the country's biggest-ever public health responses.  Some residents woke up before dawn to stand in queues for white-suited healthcare workers to swab their throats as part of nucleic acid testing at their housing compounds.  The People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Sunday dispatched more than 2,000 medical personnel from across the army, navy and joint logistics support forces to Shanghai, an armed forces newspaper reported.  About 38,000 healthcare workers from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang and the capital Beijing have been dispatched to Shanghai, according to state media, which showed them arriving, suitcase-laden and masked up, by high-speed rail and aircraft.  It is China's largest public health response since it tackled the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus was first discovered in late 2019. The State Council said the PLA dispatched more than 4,000 medical personnel to the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is, at that time.  Shanghai, which began a two-stage lockdown on March 28 that has been expanded to confine practically all residents to their homes, reported 8,581 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and 425 symptomatic COVID cases for April 3. It also asked residents to self-test on Sunday.  The city has emerged as a test of China's COVID elimination strategy based on testing, tracing and quarantining all positive cases and their close contacts.  The country has 12,400 institutions capable of processing tests from as many as 900 million people a day, a senior Chinese health official was reported as saying last month.  China's primarily uses pool testing, a process in which up to 20 swab samples are mixed together for more rapid processing.  The city has also converted multiple hospitals, gymnasiums, apartment blocks and other venues into central quarantine sites, including the Shanghai New International Expo Center which can hold 15,000 patients at full capacity.  Individuals who refuse to be tested for COVID for no justifiable reason will face administrative or criminal punishment, Shanghai police said on Saturday.  PUBLIC FRUSTRATION  The surge in state support for Shanghai comes as the city is straining under the demands of the country's "dynamic clearance" strategy, with some residents complaining of crowded and unsanitary central quarantine centres, as well as difficulties in securing food and medical help.  1/2 A person in personal protective equipment (PPE) walks a dog at a resident community, as the second stage of a two-stage lockdown has been launched to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Shanghai, China April 3, 2022. REUTERS/Aly Song Read More  Some have begun to question the policies, asking why COVID-positive children are separated from their parents. Western diplomats have also urged China not to do so. read more  On Monday Shanghai official Wu Qianyu told a news conference that children could be accompanied by their parents if the parents were also infected, but separated if they were not, adding that policies were still being refined.  There has also been increasing public questioning why mild or asymptomatic infections - the majority of Shanghai's cases - cannot isolate at home. read more  A Shanghai resident, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told Reuters he had been transported to a central quarantine facility on Sunday night after reporting a positive result on a self test more than a week ago.  Another antigen test on Saturday showed he was no longer infected, but authorities insisted on sending him to quarantine, where he has been put in a flat where he has to share a toilet with two other patients, both of whom are still testing positive.  "How is this isolation?" he said, adding that he was now afraid of being re-infected. "I'm not in any mood to do anything right now, I can't sleep."  On Monday, videos circulating on the WeChat messaging app showed scores of people rushing to grab bedding and supplies from the dirty floor of what the poster said was a quarantine centre whose premises were still littered with construction materials.  Reuters could not independently verify the footage.  WORKERS UNDER STRAIN  The pressure on the city's healthcare workers and Communist Party members has also been great, as they work around the clock to manage the city's lockdown and deal with residents' frustrations.  Photos and videos have gone viral on Chinese social media of exhausted workers and volunteers sleeping in plastic chairs or on the grass outside housing compounds, or being berated by residents.  On Saturday, the city's Pudong Chinese Center for Disease Control said it was investigating a leaked recording of a call between a staff member and the relative of a patient, who was perplexed by his father's COVID test results.  The CDC staff member, who local media identified as infectious disease expert Zhu Weiping, could be heard saying exasperatedly that she herself had raised concerns over the current quarantine and testing rules and that the virus had become a "political" one.  Reuters was not able to independently verify the recording which went viral on Chinese social media.  Users of the Weibo social media platform started a hashtag "protect Zhu Weiping," which by Monday had 2.9 million views, amid concerns that she could face punishment for speaking out against the official line.  Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the country to curb the momentum of the outbreak as soon as possible while sticking to the "dynamic-clearance" policy. read more  On Saturday, Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan, who was sent to Shanghai by the central government, urged the city to "make resolute and swift moves" to curb the pandemic.  The eastern city of Suzhou said it had detected a version of the Omicron BA.1.1 subvariant that doesn't match any others in the domestic database or the international variant tracking database GISAID, state television reported.  The state-backed Science and Technology Daily said it remains unclear whether the virus is a new sub-branch of Omicron and that the emergence of one or two new versions is normal given the spread of Omicron in China, citing an unidentified expert with a national database.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "We request that under no circumstances should parents and children be separated," said a letter written by the French consulate in Shanghai that was addressed to the foreign affairs office of Shanghai on March 31.  In a separate letter to the Chinese foreign ministry dated the same day, the British embassy in Beijing said it was concerned by "recent instances when local authorities have sought to separate minors who tested positive for COVID-19 from their parents" and requested assurances that this would not happen to diplomatic staff.  The French consulate and British embassy both said they were writing the letters on behalf of other countries, including European Union states as well as others including Norway, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand after hearing about difficulties caused by Shanghai's lockdown, which the city started carrying out in two stages starting March 28.  Asymptomatic or mild cases should be sent to "a specialized isolation environment with staff who can communicate in English," said the French consulate letter, a copy of which Reuters has seen and verified with two sources.  Currently, asymptomatic cases are sent to centralised quarantine centres, some of which have been described as unsanitary and overcrowded. read more  The British embassy said there were concerns over the conditions and lack of privacy in recently deployed mobile hospital facilities, adding that isolating in diplomatic housing was a "preferable solution and consistent with our Vienna Convention privileges," in the letter seen by Reuters and verified by two sources.  "The British Consulate-General in Shanghai has been raising its concerns about various aspects of the current COVID policies in relation to all British Nationals in China, with the relevant Chinese authorities," a spokesperson for the consulate said.  The French consulate declined to comment on the letter. The Australian Consulate General in Shanghai, which was cited in the letters, also declined to comment but said it had been engaging with local authorities on the COVID-19 restrictions.  The U.S. did not appear as a signatory on either letter.  However, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Jim Heller, told members of a private chat group for U.S. citizens that the consulate had been underscoring many of the concerns raised by the European letter with the Shanghai government.  A U.S. embassy spokesperson declined to comment on Heller's remarks but said that the way embassy staff were treated in the COVID pandemic was "job one" and that the embassy was engaging on COVID-related policy with the Chinese government.  Other countries, such as Norway, Switzerland and New Zealand, which were mentioned in the letters, did not respond to requests for comment.  The Chinese foreign ministry also did not respond to a request for comment.  On Monday, Shanghai official Wu Qianyu told a news conference that children could be accompanied by their parents if the parents were also infected, but separated if they were not, adding that policies were still being refined.

REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File Photo  ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Reuters) - Pakistan's top court adjourned on Monday without deciding on the legality of Prime Minister Imran Khan actions in blocking an opposition attempt to oust him, a move that has led to political turmoil in the nuclear-armed nation.  Khan, a former cricket star, lost his majority in parliament last week as his opponents built support in advance of a vote of no-confidence that had been due on Sunday.  But the deputy speaker of parliament, a member of Khan's party, threw out the no-confidence motion that Khan had been widely expected to lose, ruling it was part of a foreign conspiracy and unconstitutional. Khan then dissolved parliament. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The stand-off has thrown the country of 220 million people, which the military has ruled for almost half its history since independence in 1947, into a full-blown constitutional crisis.  Pakistan's opposition has challenged Khan's decision in a legal case that began on Monday, with a five-member Supreme Court bench hearing arguments in a packed courtroom.  The court failed to come to a verdict during the three-hour hearing and will return on Tuesday.  "The ruling was unlawful - why?" Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial told lawyers for Pakistan's opposition.  Whatever the Supreme Court decides, Pakistan looks to be heading for a fresh election before the completion of the current term of the parliament and the prime minister in 2023.  If Khan prevails, polls will happen within 90 days. The opposition also wants an early election, albeit after delivering a political defeat to Khan by ousting him through a parliamentary vote.  Opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif called the blocking of the vote "nothing short of high treason".  "The nation is stunned," the English-language Dawn newspaper said in an editorial.  "Even as political pundits and the media confidently predicted Mr Imran Khan's defeat in the vote of no-confidence, he seemed unperturbed. No one could have guessed that his last ploy would involve having the democratic order burnt down."  ELECTION IN 90 DAYS?  Khan also dissolved the cabinet and wants a general election within 90 days, although that decision officially rests with the president and the election commission, and depends on the outcome of the court hearing.  The largely ceremonial head of state, President Arif Alvi, said in a statement that Khan would stay on as prime minister in an interim role until a caretaker prime minister was appointed under whom a general election would be held.  Alvi wrote to both Khan and Sharif, asking them to put forward names for a caretaker prime minister within three days, the president's office said in a statement.  But whether an election will happen depends largely on the outcome of the legal proceedings.  The Supreme Court could order that parliament be reconstituted, call for a new election, or bar Khan from standing again if he is found to have acted unconstitutionally.  The court could also decide that it cannot intervene in parliamentary affairs.  Khan says he did not act unconstitutionally, calling the move to oust him a plot orchestrated by the United States - a claim Washington denies. read more  After coming to power in 2018, Khan moved Pakistan closer to China and Russia and away from the United States. read more  Political analysts say the powerful military regarded Khan's conservative, nationalist agenda favourably when he won election in 2018, but later cooled towards him over various wrangles.  The military denies involvement in civilian politics but the generals are unlikely to stand by if they believe political chaos was damaging the country or if their core interests were threatened.

REUTERS/Heru Asprihanto  JAKARTA, April 4 (Reuters) - An Indonesian court handed down a death sentence on Monday to a teacher for raping 13 girls at an Islamic school, upholding an appeal by prosecutors for the death penalty after he had initially received a sentence of life in prison.  The case of teacher Herry Wirawan has shocked Indonesia and shone a spotlight on the need to protect children from sexual violence in the country's religious boarding schools.

Ira Mambo, Herry's lawyer, declined to comment on whether there would be an appeal, citing a need to see the full ruling from the court.  A spokesperson for the local prosecutor's office also said it would wait to receive the final ruling before commenting.  Between 2016 and 2021, Herry sexually groomed the 13 girls, who were between 12 and 16 years old, and impregnated eight of his victims, a judge said in February. read more  Indonesian officials, including the country's child protection minister, had also backed calls for the death penalty, though the nation's human rights commission, which opposes the death penalty, said it was not appropriate.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly  WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in February, likely because of persistent shortages of materials and a shift in spending back to services, but manufacturing remains supported by low inventories at businesses.  The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders fell 0.5% in February. Data for January was revised slightly higher to show orders rising 1.5% instead of 1.4% as previously reported. February's decrease in factory orders was in line with economists' expectations.  Manufacturing accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. An Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey last Friday showed its index of national factory activity declined in March to the lowest level since September 2020, with factories reporting no let-up in supply chain challenges.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The global supply crunch has been worsened by Russia's war against Ukraine, which has sent prices for commodities like oil and wheat soaring. Though demand is reverting back to services, business inventories remain lean, which should keep factories humming. Government data last week showed that consumer spending on services increased by the most in seven months in February.  The decline in factory orders in February was led by a 5.3% tumble in transportation equipment. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.6%, likely reflecting an ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has hampered production.  There were also sharp decreases in orders for machinery as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6%. Orders for furniture and related products rebounded 2.7%.  Shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.6% after advancing 1.4% in January. Inventories at factories climbed 0.6%. Unfilled orders gained 0.4% after increasing 0.9% in the prior month.  The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, slipped 0.2% instead of 0.3% as previously reported last month.  Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3% in February instead of the previously reported 0.5%.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri  April 4 (Reuters) - When buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC was seeking lenders to finance its acquisition of business software company Anaplan Inc (PLAN.N) last month, it skipped banks and went directly to private equity lenders including Blackstone Inc (BX.N) and Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N).  Within eight days, Thoma Bravo secured a $2.6 billion loan based partly on annual recurring revenue, one of the largest of its kind, and announced the $10.7 billion buyout.  The Anaplan deal was the latest example of what capital market insiders see as the growing clout of private equity firms' lending arms in financing leveraged buyouts, particularly of technology companies.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Banks and junk bond investors have grown jittery about surging inflation and geopolitical tensions since Russia invaded Ukraine. This has allowed private equity firms to step in to finance deals involving tech companies whose businesses have grown with the rise of remote work and online commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Buyout firms, such as Blackstone, Apollo, KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) and Ares Management Inc (ARES.N), have diversified their business in the last few years beyond the acquisition of companies into becoming corporate lenders.  Loans the private equity firms offer are more expensive than bank debt, so they were generally used mostly by small companies that did not generate enough cash flow to win the support of banks.  Now, tech buyouts are prime targets for these leveraged loans because tech companies often have strong revenue growth but little cash flow as they spend on expansion plans. Private equity firms are not hindered by regulations that limit bank lending to companies that post little or no profit.  Also, banks have also grown more conservative about underwriting junk-rated debt in the current market turbulence. Private equity firms do not need to underwrite the debt because they hold on to it, either in private credit funds or listed vehicles called business development companies. Rising interest rates make these loans more lucrative for them.  "We are seeing sponsors dual-tracking debt processes for new deals. They are not only speaking with investment banks, but also with direct lenders," said Sonali Jindal, a debt finance partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  Comprehensive data on non-bank loans are hard to come by, because many of these deals are not announced. Direct Lending Deals, a data provider, says there were 25 leveraged buyouts in 2021 financed with so-called unitranche debt of more than $1 billion from non-bank lenders, more than six times as many such deals, which numbered only four a year earlier.  Thoma Bravo financed 16 out of its 19 buyouts in 2021 by turning to private equity lenders, many of which were offered based on how much recurring revenue the companies generated rather than how much cash flow they had.  Erwin Mock, Thoma Bravo's head of capital markets, said non-bank lenders give it the option to add more debt to the companies it buys and often close on a deal quicker than the banks.  "The private debt market gives us the flexibility to do recurring revenue loan deals, which the syndicated market currently cannot provide that option," Mock said.  Some private equity firms are also providing loans that go beyond leveraged buyouts. For example, Apollo last month upsized its commitment on the biggest ever loan extended by a private equity firm; a $5.1 billion loan to SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), backed by technology assets in the Japanese conglomerate's Vision Fund 2.  NOT CONSTRAINED  Private equity firms provide the debt using money that institutions invest with them, rather than relying on a depositor base as commercial banks do. They say this insulates the wider financial system from their potential losses if some deals go sour.  "We are not constrained by anything other than the risk when we are making these private loans," said Brad Marshall, head of North America private credit at Blackstone, whereas banks are constrained by "what the rating agencies are going to say, and how banks think about using their balance sheet."  Some bankers say they are worried they are losing market share in the junk debt market. Others are more sanguine, pointing out that the private equity firms are providing loans that banks would not have been allowed to extend in the first place. They also say that many of these loans get refinanced with cheaper bank debt once the borrowing companies start building cash flow.  Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), said the direct lending deals are allowing some private equity firms to saddle companies with debt to a level that banks would not have allowed.  "While that may to a degree increase risk, they may view that as a positive," said Feldgoise.

REUTERS/Mayela Lopez  SAN JOSE, April 4 (Reuters) - Economist Rodrigo Chaves extended a hand to the opposition upon winning the Costa Rican presidency on Sunday after a bruising election campaign in which the former World Bank official vowed to break with traditional politics.  Defeating former president Jose Maria Figueres by about 53% to 47% in a run-off vote, according to preliminary results, the bearded 60-year-old Chaves quickly dropped his confrontational campaign rhetoric and said it was time to work together.  "Tonight, let's set aside the party colors that can easily divide us," Chaves, told dozens of cheering supporters in the capital, San Jose, on Sunday night. "I humbly ask you that we unite beneath the blue, white and red of our national flag."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Chaves will take office next month with his Social Democratic Progress Party (PPSD) holding just 10 of the national parliament's 57 seats, while the party of Figueres, who came first in an indecisive first round vote in February, has 19.  At 57%, turnout was the lowest in decades, reflecting apathy among many voters in Costa Rica, where straitened economic times have fueled disenchantment with the political class.  Chaves, whose campaign was buffeted by allegations of sexual harassment stemming from his time at the World Bank, had vowed to use referenda to work around parliament, and also pledged to help the poor by keeping down the price of basic goods.  He has repeatedly denied the harassment allegations. But his policies, combative style and confrontational approach to the media drew comparisons to other anti-establishment leaders in the Americas, including former U.S. president Donald Trump.  A few dozen of Chaves' supporters gathered for a modest but lively watch party at a downtown hotel. Dancing began before the results and the festivities continued after his speech.  Caravans of revelers celebrating Chaves' victory honked their car horns as they passed the hotel where Figueres' supporters had gathered. Inside, the mood was somber and party flags were lowered immediately after Figueres conceded.  ECONOMIC CHALLENGE  In the end, a belief that Chaves could deliver a fresh start for Costa Ricans proved decisive in seeing off the challenge of Figueres, who was president from 1994-1998 and is a scion of one of the most powerful political families in the country.  Adrian Salazar, 57, and his family were among the Chaves supporters celebrating in the streets of central San Jose.  "I voted thinking we weren't going to win, but confident that we need new faces to save the country," said Salazar, attributing the triumph to a "hunger for real change."  Still, in his victory address, Chaves namechecked Figueres' father, three-time president Jose Figueres Ferrer, as he sought to win over opponents to help him govern. read more  Chaves spent almost three decades at the World Bank, and is not a complete newcomer to politics. He briefly served as finance minister under outgoing president Carlos Alvarado, who is barred by law from seeking immediate re-election.  Chaves sought to underline his economic credentials in his campaign pitch to Costa Ricans, who over the past two decades have seen unemployment steadily creep up, inequality rise and the country slip deeper into debt during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In January 2021, the country agreed to $1.78 billion in financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.  In exchange, the government vowed to adopt a raft of fiscal changes and austerity measures to stabilize finances. But the fragmented parliament has so far made little headway on them.

REUTERS/Monica Quesada  SAN JOSE, April 3 (Reuters) - Anti-establishment economist Rodrigo Chaves clinched Costa Rica's presidency on Sunday, upending decades of political consensus in the Central American country that is grappling with growing social discontent and mounting national debt.  Chaves, a veteran former official of the World Bank, was projected to win about 52.9% of the vote in the run-off ballot, a preliminary tally by the electoral tribunal showed, based on returns from some 97% of polling stations.  Rival candidate and former Costa Rican president Jose Maria Figueres was seen securing about 47.1%.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Speaking to supporters in San Jose, the capital, the 60-year-old Chaves said he accepted his victory with humility, and urged Figueres to help him move the country forward.  "I humbly beg Jose Maria and his party to work together to make possible what Don Jose Maria himself called the Costa Rican miracle," he said, referring to Figueres' father, Jose Figueres Ferrer, who served as president three times.  "Let's put aside pettiness and vanity. Tonight we will begin together to serve our country," added Chaves, who is set to assume office on May 8.  Figueres quickly conceded defeat after results came in.  "I congratulate Rodrigo Chaves, and I wish him the best," he told supporters.  Caravans of cars sporting the flag of Chaves' Social Democratic Progress Party (PPSD) crowded the streets of downtown San Jose in celebration.  Polls had shown Chaves to be a slight favorite heading into the election after he unexpectedly finished runner-up to Figueres in an indecisive first round of voting in February.  Chaves, who briefly served as finance minister for outgoing President Carlos Alvarado, ran as a maverick. He has vowed to shake up the political elite, even pledging to use referendums to bypass Congress to bring change. read more  "If the people go out to vote, this is going to be a sweep, a tsunami," Chaves said after casting his ballot on Sunday.  Figueres campaigned on his experience and family political legacy in Costa Rica, a tourist destination and bastion of environmentalism long regarded as one of the most stable democracies in Latin America.  On Twitter, Alvarado said he had called to congratulate Chaves and pledged an orderly handover of power.  Turnout was 57.3%, the electoral tribunal said, less than the 60% who cast ballots in the first round.  Going into Sunday's vote, some voters said they were lukewarm on both candidates, whose political careers have been tainted by accusations of wrongdoing.  Chaves faced accusations of sexual harassment during his World Bank tenure, which he denied. Figueres resigned as executive director of the World Economic Forum in 2004 amid accusations that he had influenced state contracts with Alcatel, a telecoms company. That case was never tried in court.  David Diaz, 33, said he was not enthused by Chaves or Figueres. He left home early to vote by 7 a.m. in the rural town of Tacacori, about 30 km (19 miles) from San Jose.  "I see very little movement, there is a lot of apathy," said Diaz, a mechanic at a medical device factory.  Chaves faces the challenges of reviving an economy battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and alleviating the poverty in which about 23% of a population of 5.1 million live.  Growing income disparity makes Costa Rica one of the world's most unequal countries, with unemployment of almost 15%. read more  In January 2021, the country agreed to $1.78 billion in financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo  April 4 (Reuters) - Moscow is studying what extra incentives it needs to offer highly skilled Russian expatriates to persuade them to return home, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Monday.  Russia has a reputation for producing world-class engineers and other technical specialists, but has for years been trying to counter an exodus of its brightest scientists.  Moreover, Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, has prompted thousands of Russians who oppose the conflict and want to avoid seeing their living standards slip under Western sanctions to leave the country.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Alexander Sergeyev, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, spoke last week of a large brain drain under Western sanctions - imposed in 2014 in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and significantly toughened since February.  Russia has had a repatriation programme for skilled workers since 2007.  "The further development of this programme and additional benefits to attract highly qualified Russian specialists from different spheres is being discussed," the ministry said, without elaborating on what the benefits might be.  The current programme includes compensation for the cost of moving, six months of unemployment benefits and other financial incentives, the ministry said.  Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, cited sources close to the government as saying that specialists were showing interest in returning to Russia because they faced pressure in Western countries over Moscow's intervention in Ukraine.  Russia has sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it calls a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists.  Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

REUTERS/Richard Carson/File Photo  LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Investors made few changes to petroleum positions last week as prices remained poised between upside risks from the disruption of Russian exports and downside risks from recession and China's coronavirus outbreaks.  Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 15 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts in the week to March 29, according to position records.  Fund sales reversed purchases of 16 million barrels the previous week - but the reporting deadline came before the announcement of a record release of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve on March 31.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The latest changes included liquidation of 10 million barrels of previous bullish long positions and the initiation of 6 million barrels of new bearish short positions.  (Chartbook: https://tmsnrt.rs/3DF4ODe)  There were small sales of Brent (-8 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-4 million), U.S. gasoline (-3 million) and European gas oil (-2 million) partially offset by small purchases of U.S. diesel (+2 million).  Net long positions across all six contracts amounted to just 553 million barrels (39th percentile for all weeks since 2013) although the ratio of long to short positions was still relatively high at 4.81:1 (61st percentile).  The disparity was consistent with a cautious approach among fund managers amid conflicting pressures on prices, high levels of uncertainty and elevated volatility, which makes taking and holding positions risky and expensive.  Reflecting this, the number of open futures positions held by all traders across the six contracts fell by a further 59 million barrels to 5,059 million, the fewest since May 2015.  Like other traders, funds were struggling to resolve the triple uncertainty from the disruption of Russia's oil exports, signs of a slowdown in the major economies, and China's worsening outbreaks of coronavirus.  Funds were significantly more bullish about the outlook for refined fuels and especially middle distillates rather than crude, reflecting the low level of diesel and gas oil inventories around the world.  Even in distillates, however, bullishness stemming from low inventories and the impact of the conflict on Russia's exports was tempered by concerns about economic slowdowns evident in the United States, Europe, China and the rest of Asia.

REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo  LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 4 (Reuters) - The impact on commodity prices of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has largely focused on crude oil and natural gas in Europe, but a massive surge in Australia's forecast earnings from natural resources shows the wider impact.  Australia's government forecaster said in its latest Resources and Energy Quarterly report, released on Monday, that earnings from commodity exports would rise to a record A$424.9 billion ($318 billion) for the fiscal year to June 30, 2022.  This is up a full third from earnings in 2020-21, and also up nearly A$50 billion since the December quarter report. Driving the jump, says the Office of the Chief Economist at the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, is the upsurge in the price of energy commodities since Moscow's Feb. 24 attack on its neighbour.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It's also likely that the government is being cautious with its forecasting, with the price assumptions likely to be below what is actually achieved over the year to June 30.  Iron ore is Australia's biggest commodity earner. While this is expected to remain the case, the government actually expects revenue from the steel raw material to drop this fiscal year compared to last.  Iron ore export earnings are forecast at A$135 billion for the 2021-22 year, down from A$158 billion in 2020-21, with lower prices the culprit given that volumes are expected to rise to 897 million tonnes from 867 million.  But the price assumption used for iron ore for the 2021-22 year is $118 a tonne. That is likely to prove on the low side, given the spot price is now $160.01, and has only been below the assumed average price for about 12 weeks of the nine months so far in the current fiscal year.  Iron ore has seen some impact from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, mainly centred around expectations of tighter steel markets as buyers self-sanction purchases from Russia. That has led to the expectation that steel mills in Asia will produce more in order to make up for lost Russian supplies.  But the resources that have surged in the wake of Russia's action, which Moscow refers to as a "special military operation", are energy commodities such as coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Australia's LNG exports are forecast to earn A$70 billion in 2021-22, more than double the A$32 billion for the previous fiscal year, even though volumes are expected to rise modestly to 82 million tonnes from 77 million.  The jump is due to the forecast price rising to A$16 a gigajoule, which is about $11.99 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).  Asian spot LNG prices have been above this level since the start of the fiscal year, reaching a record $48.30 per mmBtu in late December. But the bulk of LNG is sold under crude oil-linked long-term contracts, and therefore would have been sold at prices well below the spot level.  Nonetheless, the strength in LNG prices is likely to continue as long as Europe seeks alternatives to Russian pipeline gas.  STELLAR COAL  Australia is the world's largest exporter of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, and it's this commodity = which largely flies under the radar - that is the standout performer.  Earnings from metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, are forecast to almost triple to A$65 billion in 2021-22 as the expected price for the year jumps to $348 a tonne from $123 in 2020-21.  Again, this price forecast looks cautious. The Singapore Exchange contract has traded above this level since the start of year, including a surge to a record of $635 a tonne in mid-March, followed by a retreat to a still-elevated $480 on April 1.  Russia is a significant exporter of coking coal, supplying about 30% of Europe's needs, and if self-sanctioning by European steel mills does occur, an already tight seaborne market is going to face further challenges.  Russia is also a major exporter of thermal coal, used mainly for power generation, ranking behind Indonesia and Australia.  Prices for thermal coal have also surged, with the Australian benchmark Newcastle Weekly Index , as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, hitting an all-time high of $379.69 a tonne in mid-March, before declining to $262.30 by April 1.  Nonetheless, thermal coal prices remain well above the Australian government's forecast of $193 a tonne for the 2021-22 year. The forecast level would already result in export earnings of A$45 billion, nearly three times the A$17 billion recorded for the prior year.  It's not just energy commodities getting a boost, given Russia is also a major exporter of metals.  Australia expects earnings from aluminium exports to rise to A$5.8 billion from A$3.9 billion, nickel to go to A$7 billion from A$3.9 billion and copper to A$13 billion from A$12 billion, even though export volumes of the industrial metal are expected to decline by 6.9% in 2021-22.  Overall, it's clear that the Russia-Ukraine crisis is going to deliver Australia, and other diversified commodity exporters, a massive earnings boost.  How long it lasts will depend on whether the conflict can be resolved and Russia re-admitted to the Western world's economies, and how widespread self-sanctioning of Russia's commodity exports becomes.

And while some of the analyses can get lost in the blizzard of impressive milestones notched up by commodities and bonds in the first quarter of 2022, one thing is clear: this has the classic indicators of a late cycle economic expansion.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  A period when economic growth is strong but slowing and inflation is high forcing policymakers to squeeze the monetary spigots means only one thing: time to load up on quality names.  Despite the 11% rise in world stocks in the last two weeks, utilities and healthcare names have outperformed the wider index. Even in credit markets where a high yield bond market rally has dominated headlines, the top gainers are defensive telecoms and utility names, according to BofA.  That trend shows no signs of slowing in the early days of April. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields hit their highest levels in three years at 2.4950%, pushing the dollar higher while an index of Asian stocks paused after recent gains.  A strong monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday and hawkish comments by U.S. policymakers has prompted traders to price in a 73% probability of a 50 basis points rate hike in May. The last time the Fed hiked rates by that quantum was in the tech-mania days of May 2000.  European and U.S. stock futures are slightly higher.  Oil prices inched higher on Monday as worries about tight supply persisted even as investors eyed the release of supplies from strategic reserves from consuming nations and a truce in Yemen sparked hopes that supply issues in the Middle East could abate.  Oil slid 13% last week - the biggest weekly fall in two years - after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the largest-ever oil reserves release.  Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:  Germany's defence minister said on Sunday that the European Union must discuss banning the import of Russian gas after Ukrainian and European officials accused Russian forces of committing atrocities near Kyiv. read more  Telecom Italia has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber. read more  Speaker's corner: ECB President Christine Lagarde, Bank of Spain´s governor Pablo Hernández de Cos, Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor, Bank of England.

REUTERS/Rebecca Noble  TUCSON, Ariz., April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. self-driving truck companies have a golden opportunity in the form of a nationwide driver shortage, but their robot drivers still are not ready and neither are their biggest potential customers.  The uncertainties surrounding autonomous trucking come at a critical time for the U.S. trucking industry, which faces a record shortage of 80,000 drivers as demand for online shopping and rapid delivery times is straining supply chains.  Private investors, who have so far poured nearly $9 billion into U.S. AV trucking companies according to data from Pitchbook, are hoping that self-driving trucks eventually catch on. Among the companies developing the technology are TuSimple Holdings Inc (TSP.O), Aurora Innovation Inc (AUR.O), Embark Technology Inc (EMBK.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Waymo.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But large logistics companies, who represent the tech startups' coveted future customers, are in no rush to sign big contracts. They continue to test the technology of multiple providers in limited partnerships.  "Everybody is at a point where they're hedging their bets," said Eric Fuller, the Chief Executive of US Xpress Enterprises Inc (USX.N), a carrier and trucking brokerage that manages 6,000 of its own tractors.  The company has announced partnerships with TuSimple and Aurora. Fuller, who also sits on TuSimple's advisory board, said US Xpress was working with all the other AV companies, but had yet to announce more partnerships.  The companies say they have developed technology that can safely pilot a 33,000 pound (15,000 kg) truck down a busy highway and are pushing toward commercial launches.  They provide the sensors and software, and some have partnered with truck manufacturers to incorporate their technology at the assembly line, but all rely on large logistics companies to pay for their offering.  The U.S. Southwest, primarily Texas and Arizona, where weather and regulations are favorable, has emerged as the testing ground for heavy-duty autonomous vehicle (AV) companies.  Large logistics groups such as DHL (DPWGn.DE), United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and Ryder System Inc (R.N) have launched pilot programs with several autonomous trucking companies.  But logistics giants also say they are still in the early stages of exploring the technology and are waiting to see which startups have the team, capital and network to survive and prove self-driving to be feasible on a large scale.  'SHAKING THINGS OUT'  While much attention has been focused on self-driving taxis, industry experts increasingly bet on driverless trucks to be the first autonomous vehicles to generate meaningful revenue due to the less complex driving environment in which they operate. read more  Making a meaningful dent in the U.S. market of 2.3 million trucks will take time, however, and industry experts project no more than a few hundred-thousand autonomous trucks over the next decade.  Logistics companies hope robo-trucks will one day take over monotonous long-haul tours, but not replace existing jobs.  Human drivers will prefer to spend more time on shorter, complex routes near their homes - routes that are still too difficult for self-driving technology.  Pitchbook analysts expect the global AV trucking market to balloon from around $530 million in 2023 to $167 billion in 2035.  "There's still opportunity for more players. We're not at a point where we're shaking things out," Jim Monkmeyer, president for transportation at DHL Supply Chain, said during a February visit to TuSimple's testing facility in Tucson, Arizona.  DHL Supply Chain, which operates some 1,500 trucks and manages around $3 billion of annual North American freight spend, has so far partnered with TuSimple and Embark and put in reservations for future trucks with both companies. Those orders are slated to be fulfilled in 2024.  Monkmeyer said DHL had contracted with multiple providers to reduce its risks, but added that placing truck reservations early was crucial in order to be among the first to explore the new technology.  Monkmeyer and his logistics colleagues say self-driving trucks offer the potential to increase freight capacity and reduce cost, with robots, unlike humans, not subject to a mandatory 11-hour daily driving limit.  LOWER COSTS  But the economics pan out only once the driver is out of the cabin.  So far, only TuSimple has removed its safety drivers in a handful of night-time trial runs along an 80-mile (130 km) stretch of highway between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona.  The company is planning to present per-mile cost calculations in the next few months, Cheng Lu, TuSimple's former CEO, said in late February, just days before the company replaced him in a surprise move. read more  "Your cost has to either be lower than what today's costs are, or there is a clear line of sight to be lower," said Lu, who now serves as an adviser to the new CEO.  Drivers account for more than 40% of per-mile costs, according to data by the American Transportation Research Institute.  Reuters Graphics  Graphic on current per-mile trucking costs: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ulCdyo  Autonomous driving could halve driver costs, with the companies planning to charge between 35 and 45 cents in per-mile subscription fees, according to two industry experts.  But the companies, three of them publicly listed, are far from generating meaningful revenue, let alone profit. Embark recorded a 2021 net loss of $124 million, TuSimple had a loss of $411 million and Aurora lost $755 million.  For the logistics partners, access to sufficient capital is crucial when determining whom to partner with, DHL's Monkmeyer and US Xpress' Fuller said.  TuSimple said it ended 2021 with some $1.3 billion left in cash, Aurora with $1.6 billion.  But the companies also confront other real-world hurdles as they try to release their technology on a larger scale.  Ryder, which operates nearly 240,000 trucks and around 800 U.S. maintenance locations, has partnered with TuSimple, Waymo and Embark to explore how self-driving trucks would fit into its network.  The logistics company wants to understand how to service the host of lidar, radar and camera sensors and whether trucks operating around the clock require different maintenance schedules.  In the long run, the tech companies also had to tackle more challenging driving conditions, such as snow, said Ryder's head of new product development, Karen Jones.  "I can't just run an autonomous business in the Southwest and Southeast, you have to figure out how to get to the Northeast," she said.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo  April 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Saturday reported record electric vehicle deliveries for the first quarter, largely meeting analysts' estimates, but production fell from the previous quarter as supply chain disruptions and a China plant suspension weighed.  "This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy," Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted. "Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day."  Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, and up 68% from a year earlier. Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308,836 cars, according to Refinitiv data.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles from January to March, down from 305,840 the previous quarter.  Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth.  But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease. read more  The deliveries were "better than feared given supply chain issues," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a report.  Tesla said it sold a total of 295,324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles, while it delivered 14,724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.  PRICE HIKE  Skyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars, but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales, analysts said.  Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  "Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds," Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said, adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth.  Toyota and GM, Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier. read more  Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year, as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year.  Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide, Germany, in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin, Texas, were to begin in the near future.  The company's stock soared after Tesla this week revealed plans to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split. read more Tesla shares have risen about 3% so far this year, while GM and Ford shares have declined.

Batiste, who leads the band on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," landed five awards overall, including the night's biggest prize for "We Are," a jazz album inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.  "I believe this to my core - there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor. The creative arts are subjective," Batiste said. "I just put my head down and I work on the craft every day."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Batiste's other wins included best music video for "Freedom," a vibrantly colored tribute to New Orleans, and an award for composing and arranging of songs for animated Pixar movie "Soul."  Silk Sonic, featuring Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, claimed the song and record of the year awards for their 1970s inspired hit "Leave the Door Open." The pair rose from their seats and danced slowly before making their way to the stage.  "We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point," joked Paak as the pair accepted the second honor.  Olivia Rodrigo, the 19-year-old singer of heartbreak ballad "drivers license" on her album "Sour," scored three awards, including best new artist.  "This is my biggest dream come true. Thank you so much!" Rodrigo said as she held her trophy.  Midway through the ceremony, host Trevor Noah introduced a video message from Zelenskiy, who contrasted the joy found through music to the devastation caused by Russia's invasion of his country more than a month ago.  1/8 Jon Batiste poses with their Grammys for Best American Roots Performance for "Cry," Album of the year for “We Are,” Best American roots song, Best music video and Best score soundtrack for visual media for “Soul," at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., April 3, 2022. REUTERS/Steve Marcus Read More  "What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people," Zelenskiy, wearing a green t-shirt, said in a hoarse voice.  "Fill the silence with your music," he added. "Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence." L2N2W10HZ  The remarks preceded a John Legend performance that featured two Ukrainian musicians and a Ukrainian poet.  The highest honors in music were postponed from January during a spike in COVID-19 cases and moved from Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Stars walked a red carpet and thousands of spectators packed the venue, a contrast to last year's scaled-down outdoor event.  Noah urged the audience to think of the evening as "a concert where we are handing out awards."  "We are going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths," Noah added, a jab about actor Will Smith, who a week ago slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars and told him not to mention his wife's name.  Korean pop band BTS, a global phenomenon that has never won a Grammy, left empty-handed again. But the group delivered a high-octane performance of their hit "Butter," dodging laser beams in what looked like a scene out of a heist movie.  Rock band Foo Fighters, whose drummer Taylor Hawkins died a little over a week ago, won three awards, including best rock album for "Medicine at Midnight." No one from the band appeared to accept the trophies.  Winners were chosen by some 11,000 voting members of the Recording Academy.  In comedy categories, comedian Louis C.K. won best album for "Sincerely Louis C.K.," his first comedy special since he admitted to sexual misconduct in 2017.

NFTs are crypto assets representing a digital item such as an image, video, or even land in virtual worlds, with prices of some rising so fast last year that speculators around the world sometimes "flipped" them within days for a profit.  Pili International Multimedia (8450.TWO), which makes Taiwan's longest-running television show featuring the puppets at its studio in central Taiwan's Yunlin County, says it wants to use NFTs as another source of revenue.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The sort of imagination everyone nowadays has for the online world is developing so fast that we are almost unable to grasp it," said Seika Huang, Pili's brand director.  "Instead of sitting on the sidelines, the best approach is to go ahead and understand fully what's going on. This is the fastest way to catch up."  Pili has thousands of glove puppet characters, a traditional part of Taiwanese street entertainment culture spinning colourful and highly stylised stories of heroic courage and romance, often with martial arts.  1/5 Two Pili puppet characters battle each other, with real fire as a special effect, during a demonstration at their filming studio in Yunlin, Taiwan, February 18, 2022. REUTERS/Ann Wang Read More  The puppets are painstakingly created, and expertly manoeuvred during the filming of the shows, with costumes that are sewn on and strands of hair meticulously put in place.  Pili said four of their puppet characters were made into digital versions and 30,000 sets have been sold as NFTs.  The company declined to reveal the profit-sharing with the market platform, but said prices for each set started at $40, translating to generated revenue of at least $1.2 million, since their listing in early February.  Marketing technology company VeVe, which is in charge of selling the NFTs, said the stories of the puppet heroes resonates with a younger crowd and could draw in foreign fans of super hero films, such as those based on characters from Marvel Comics.  "Westerners actually really like our martial arts heroes and kung-fu," said VeVe's brand manager Raymond Chou.  Huang, who said their initial listings had sold out seconds after launching on VeVe, is now working on transforming up to 50 other puppet characters into NFTs, potentially adding another million-dollar revenue stream for the studio.

Bodies wrapped in black tarp lay in a mass grave on the outskirts of Kyiv. In another village, the bodies of a mayor, her husband and son, and of a man believed to be a Ukrainian serviceman, also lie in a muddy pit behind a plot of land with houses where Russian forces had slept.  Zelenskyy addressed these scenes in his address in the wee hours of Monday morning.  "Presidents do not usually record addresses like this. But today I have to say just that," the president said. "After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined!"  "The pervasive consequences of looting," he added. "Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did."  "I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"  "Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure," the president said.

Ukrainian parliament member Oleksiy Goncharenko said Russian troops beheaded an elderly woman who was trying to flee the city of Bucha, where bodies have been found in mass graves, describing the graphic scene in the Kyiv region as a "scene from a horror movie."

Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. One group of nine, all in civilian clothes, were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs, one was shot in the head, and another's legs were bound.  One resident, who refused to give his name out of fear for his safety, told the AP that Russian troops went building to building and took people out of the basements where they were hiding, checking their phones for any evidence of anti-Russian activity before taking them away or shooting them.  Hanna Herega, another resident, said Russian troops started shooting at a neighbor who had gone out to gather wood for heating.  "They hit him a bit above the heel, crushing the bone, and he fell down," Herega said. "Then they shot off his left leg completely, with the boot. Then they shot him all over."  RUSSIA-CONTROLLED AREAS NEAR UKRAINE’S CAPITAL SHOW EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES: HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH  Russian troops had rolled into Bucha in the early days of the invasion and stayed up until March 30.  Russia is denying anything to do with the widespread killing of Ukrainian civilians, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Monday that "we categorically reject the accusations."  Russia's Defense Ministry claimed in a statement that fresh photos and videos of the dead bodies "have been stage managed by the Kyiv regime for the Western media."  Russia is also asking Monday for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss events in the city, but the U.S. and Britain have recently accused Russia of using Security Council meetings to spread disinformation.  Meanwhile, Russia is facing a growing avalanche of criticism for its military’s actions in Ukraine during an invasion that has now lasted 40 days.  "You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN on Sunday when reacting to photos out of Bucha.  Blinken said the U.S. is documenting any potential war crimes and vowed "accountability."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Monday that he hopes "everything possible can be done so that those behind these war crimes don’t go unpunished, and that they can appear before the courts, in this case the International Criminal Court, to answer these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and, why not say it, of genocide, too."  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said "the Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area," while U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said "reports emerging from [Bucha] and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law."

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the job that President Biden has done in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while asserting that there is more that the U.S. should be doing to make a difference in the region.  In an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press," Clinton said that the U.S. is "looking at this with our eyes wide open," and seeing the threat that Russian President Vladimir Putin poses not just to Ukraine but to "Europe, to democracy, and to global stability." Still, she claimed that the sanctions imposed and assistance given to Ukraine so far are not enough.  SEC. BLINKEN SAYS WE CANNOT BECOME ‘NUMB’ TO PUTIN'S WAR CRIMES, VOWS ‘ACCOUNTABILITY’  "We have to double down. There is more that can be done to increase pressure and stress: additional sanctions, more in the way of lethal aid, and now that there has been a pushback thanks to the brave Ukrainian military offensive action, there is time to resupply the Ukrainians so they can continue to defend their country," Clinton said.  The 2016 Democratic presidential candidate added that she would not allow Russia to rejoin international organizations, and that the Kremlin should be boycotted if they try.  So far, the Biden administration has imposed a number of sanctions against Russia aimed at isolating and crippling its economy. Still, Clinton says they can do more.  "The only way that we’re going to end the bloodshed and terror that we’re seeing unleashed in Ukraine and protect Europe and democracy is to do everything we can to impose even greater costs on Putin. There are more banks that can be sanctioned and taken out of the so-called SWIFT relationship. There is an increasing call for doing more on gas and oil."  AMID RUSSIA WAR ON UKRAINE, BILL CLINTON RELAUNCHING CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE    Clinton noted that European allies are trying to get out from under their reliance on Russian energy saying that "we need to expedite" this.  Despite pointing out what Biden can do better, Clinton stated that Biden's response to Ukraine "has been excellent." She cited "releasing classified intelligence to prevent the false flag kind of operations that Putin was counting on."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  She did not have similar praise for how Biden handled the withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. When asked if the Afghan withdrawal led to political woes that Biden has faced, Clinton responded frankly.  "I don't think it helped," she said. "I think that is obviously the case."

The United States Ambassador to Poland, Mark Brzezinski, said on Sunday that the country, which has taken in 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees in past three weeks, is committed to Ukraine’s "freedom and sovereignty."  Speaking to "Fox News Live" from Warsaw, he noted that in that city alone there are 300,000 Ukrainian refugees, which he said accounts for 10% of the city’s population.  He stressed that Poland, which has accepted the vast majority of the refugees, is "committed to tough sanctions" and "supporting the Ukrainian people."  Russia's lack of swift victory, international condemnation, and economic sanctions along with devastation and civilian losses across Ukraine have brought both countries to the negotiation table, but fighting — including a critical struggle for the city of Mariupol — continues.

Brzezinski said it is uncertain how long the war will last and that "we don’t know what [Russian President Vladimir] Putin will do next," but "in the meantime, tough sanctions [and] supporting the refugees is the approach the Poles, with the support by the Americans, is taking."  ZELENSKYY ADVISOR SAYS THE WAR COULD BE NEARING AN END IN THE NEXT 2-3 WEEKS: LIVE UPDATES  He acknowledged that "Poland has taken on enormous weight and responsibility" by accepting large number of Ukrainian refugees.  "At this point, I can report to you that this country has this in hand, although it needs and welcomes resources through its lead NGOs [nonprofit organizations] and charities," Brzezinski said, noting that that includes the Polish Red Cross.  "But, quite frankly, it will be a capacity issue," he added. "And the hope for all the people who are coming here is that they can return to Ukraine. That’s why they’re staying close to Ukraine in Poland and not going further west to Germany, to France, to Spain."  He noted that the Ukrainian refuges prefer to stay in Poland so that "they can go back to their homes quickly and start rebuilding" when the war is over.

After Russian forces scaled back operations in the outskirts of Ukraine’s capital, evidence emerged of brutal war crimes against civilians.  Human Rights Watch has documented evidence of summary executions, unlawful violence and threats against civilians, and repeated rape between February 27 and March 14. A report from the organization also implicates Russian soldiers in looting civilian property, including food, clothing, and firewood.  Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, have shared disturbing photos online of corpses strewn about abandoned streets in villages near Kyiv that were until recently under control of Russian forces.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Per international humanitarian law, belligerent armed forces are responsible for war crimes if they are found to have committed the willful killing, rape, torture, or other inhuman types of treatment of captured civilians and combatants who are in custody.  Residents of Bucha have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians without any apparent reason.  **WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT**  At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of 8 men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.  Residents say Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity and take them away or shoot them.  Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, said the bodies of more than 400 civilians were removed from Kyiv-area towns recently under attack by Russian troops.  PUTIN SHOULD FACE GLOBAL ARREST WARRANT: EX-UN PROSECUTOR WHO INVESTIGATED WAR CRIMES IN RWANDA, YUGOSLAVIA  Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Sunday that scores of dead civilians were found on the streets of Kyiv’ suburbs of Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel. He likened the scene to "a horror movie." Many of the bodies had gunshot wounds to the head and had their hands bound.  Ivana Stradner, an adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies with a background in international law, warned that similar images might emerge out of Mariupol once Russian forces leave.  "Russia, whether we like it or not, is a great power. It has United Nations Security Council authorization," Stradner told Fox News in an interview. "Yes, we are absolutely outraged at what we see over there, but whoever expects the International Criminal Court to deter Vladimir Putin from committing further war crimes absolutely lives in a parallel universe."  MSNBC'S ALI VELSHI CALLS FOR ‘DIRECT MILITARY’ ACTION FROM NATO, THE WEST IN UKRAINE  Stradner said the U.S. and its allies must send more weapons to Ukraine instead of "instead of relying on weak legal systems."  "But this really is a test for the west, because if we don't do more right now, what are we going to do when Putin uses chemical weapons or tactical nukes? He's observing how we act and what we do," she said. "Don't get me wrong, sending thoughts and prayers to Ukraine is important, but it's more important to send weapons and intelligence."  In an interview with CBS’ "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Zelenskyy said the attacks amounted to a genocide.  "We are citizens of Ukraine, and we don’t want to be subdued to the policy of [Russia]," he said. "This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated. And this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century. So, this is the torture of the whole nation."

President Biden's Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson refused to define the word "woman" on the second day of her confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee.  Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., pressed Jackson on transgender issues Tuesday night.  "Do you agree that schools should teach children that they can choose their gender?" Blackburn asked, after she read a quote from Jackson regarding Georgetown Day School, the private school on whose board Brown serves.  BIDEN'S SUPREME COURT PICK KETANJI BROWN JACKSON TESTIFIES FOR SECOND DAY: LIVE UPDATES  Jackson responded by noting that Georgetown Day School is private. When Blackburn pressed again, asking for the judge's opinion, Jackson said, "Senator, I'm not making comments about what schools can teach."  Blackburn then turned to quote the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote the majority opinion in U.S. v. Virginia (1996), in which the Court struck down Virginia Military Institute's male-only admissions policy.  "Supposed inherent differences are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national origin classifications," Blackburn said, quoting Ginsburg. "Physical differences, between men and women, however, are enduring. The two sexes are not fungible. A community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both."  "Do you agree with Justice Ginsburg that there are physical differences between men and women that are enduring?" the senator asked.  TED CRUZ QUESTIONS KETANJI BROWN JACKSON'S ANSWERS ON SEX OFFENDER CASES: ‘DISTURBING PATTERN’  "Um, senator, respectfully I am not familiar with that particular quote or case, so it's hard for me to comment," the judge responded.  "Do you interpret Justice Ginsburg's meaning of men and women as male and female?" Blackburn pressed. Jackson did not comment on the matter.  "Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman?’" the senator asked.  "Can I provide a definition? No," Jackson responded. "I can't."  "You can't?" Blackburn asked.  "Not in this context, I'm not a biologist," the judge replied.  "Do you believe the meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can't give me a definition?" Blackburn pressed.  "Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes. If there's a dispute about a definition, people make arguments, and I look at the law, and I decide," Jackson said.  Blackburn argued that "the fact that you can't give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about."  "Just last week, an entire generation of young girls watched as our taxpayer-funded institutions permitted a biological man to compete [against] and beat a biological woman in the NCAA women's swimming championships," the senator added, referring to the controversial case of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.  "What message do you think this sends to girls?"  GOP CANDIDATES STAND WITH WOMEN DEFEATED BY LIA THOMAS, CONDEMNING ‘THE DEATH OF WOMEN’S SPORTS'  "Senator, I'm not sure what message that sends. If you're asking me about the legal issues related to it, those are topics that are being hotly discussed, as you say, and could come to the Court, so I'm not able to" address them, the judge responded.  Dictionary.com defines "woman" as "an adult female person," and classifies the word as an "Elementary level" word to define.  The Republican National Committee shared a video of Jackson refusing to define "woman."  Abigail Shrier, author of the book "Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters," noted that Jackson is " celebrated for being a pathbreaking woman…but she can’t (won’t) tell you what a woman is. Not a good sign for someone who wishes to be in a position to determine the rights American women will get to keep."

Teenagers saw an increase in mental health issues stretching from persistent feelings of loneliness to suicidal thoughts last year amid school shutdowns and government-mandated restrictions during the pandemic .  "These data echo a cry for help," CDC acting Principal Deputy Director Debra Houry, said in a press release of the CDC’s findings. "The COVID-19 pandemic has created traumatic stressors that have the potential to further erode students’ mental well-being. Our research shows that surrounding youth with the proper support can reverse these trends and help our youth now and in the future."  The CDC survey found 44% of teenagers surveyed in the first six months of 2021 reported feeling persistently sad or hopeless . The figure is up from data in 2009 that found 26.1% reported hopelessness and 36.7% reported the same in 2019.  REPUBLICANS EXPOSE 'UNCOMMON' CDC, TEACHERS' UNION TIES ON COVID SCHOOL REOPENING GUIDANCE IN REPORT  Overall, 37% of high school students reported poor mental health during the pandemic and nearly 20% of teens said they contemplated suicide. Girls seriously contemplated suicide at double the rate of boys, with 1 in 4 reporting suicidal thoughts. Female students also reported higher rates of drinking and tobacco use than male counterparts.  TEACHERS UNION INFLUENCED LAST-MINUTE CDC SCHOOL GUIDANCE RECEIVED COPIES BEFORE PUBLIC RELEASE, EMAILS SHOW  Fifty-five percent of students surveyed said they encountered emotional abuse at home, while 11% reported physical abuse.  Gay and lesbian students reported worse mental health than heterosexual counterparts, with 75% reporting emotional abuse in the home and 20% reporting physical abuse. Nearly half of gay, lesbian and bisexual students reported contemplating suicide.  TEEN SUICIDE ATTEMPTS SPIKED DURING COVID-19 LOCKDOWNS: CDC  The CDC released the data Thursday after surveying roughly 7,700 students in grades 9-12 between January and June of 2021. The students who participated attended both private and public schools.  The first six months of 2021 marked the first full year of pandemic learning, which included many school districts using remote learning or hybrid models of in-person and remote learning.  Republicans on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis released a report last week revealing a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official’s testimony claiming that the agency closely coordinated with teachers' unions on school reopening guidelines.  Republicans wrote that emails between the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the White House , and the CDC showed that the AFT’s "cozy relationship with the Biden administration’s political leadership at the CDC positioned the union to impose line-by-line edits" to the reopening guidance, despite the CDC’s "past practice to keep draft guidance confidential."  Among the edits from the AFT were ones intended to make it more likely that schools would close to in-person learning, according to the Republicans.  "The damaging edits by union bosses effectively kept thousands of schools shuttered across the country, locking millions of children out of their classrooms. The Biden Administration abandoned medical science and replaced it with political science to reward one of their largest donors, harming millions of children in the process. They bypassed the science to put union bosses ahead of children," a joint statement from Republican Reps. Steve Scalise and James Comer said.  TEEN GIRLS DROVE INCREASE IN SUSPECTED SUICIDE ATTEMPTS DURING PANDEMIC, CDC REPORT FINDS  Data from March of 2021 shows that about 18% of K-12 students attended schools that only offered remote learning, while more than 30% attended schools offering a hybrid form of education . More than 50% of students were attending schools offering in-person learning five days a week, according to data from that time period.  Government-mandated restrictions were also still implemented in states such as California and Michigan last year, including face mask requirements, indoor capacity limits for establishments such as restaurants and gyms, and other caps on social gatherings.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The CDC’s report on student’s mental health comes after more than a year of health professionals and other studies warning youths were experiencing higher instances of depression and suicidal thoughts. The American Academy of Pediatrics warned in October there was a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health tied to the pandemic.  Students' educational growth has also struggled since school shutdowns, with a U.K. study reporting Monday that young kids are facing delays with writing and speaking skills. Similar U.S. studies found a third of young grade school students missed reading benchmarks likely due to remote learning.  Fox News' Jessica Chasmar contributed to this report.

A Sunday editorial from the Washington Post editorial board called for a public reckoning over the media's handling over the Hunter Biden laptop story.  The editorial is titled "The Hunter Biden story is an opportunity for a reckoning," and discusses what the press should learn from the saga surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop. In particular, the article referenced why news outlets like themselves are now authenticating thousands of emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop when the emails were first reported in 2020. While the editorial board insisted that did not prove any corruption on the part of President Biden, this did raise several questions about the media.  WILMINGTON COMPUTER SHOP OWNER SPEAKS OUT AFTER LATEST HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP DEVELOPMENTS  "For now, what’s more compelling than the assorted accusations about the Bidens’ behavior is this question: Why is confirmation of a story that first surfaced in the fall of 2020 emerging only now? When the New York Post published its blockbuster exclusive on the contents of a laptop said to have been abandoned at a Delaware repair shop by Hunter Biden, mainstream media organizations balked at running with the same narrative. Social media sites displayed even greater caution," the editorial board wrote.  During the 2020 presidential election, Twitter suspended the New York Post after they were the first to report on Hunter's emails. Prominent news outlets, including the Washington Post, either downplayed the news or accused it of being Russian disinformation.  However, the Post's editorial board insisted there was additional context behind media’s reluctance to cover the story, the publication admitted that it "doesn’t necessarily exonerate every action of every publication and platform."  "This series of events has prompted allegations of a coverup, or at best a double standard in the treatment of conservative and liberal politicians by mainstream media and social media sites," it wrote.  HUNTER BIDEN: MSNBC, ABC, CBS SIDESTEP AUTHENTICATED LAPTOP THEY DISMISSED IN 2020 WHILE ADDRESSING DOJ PROBE  Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who previously slammed the Washington Post for its late coverage of Hunter Biden's laptop, complimented the publication for admitting problems with how this story was handled, albeit with several caveats.  "The Editorial is filled with self-justifying caveats about why it was reasonable to have gotten the story so wrong. It downplays the full extent of the joint CIA/media/Big Tech lie," Greenwald tweeted. "But at least the Post now stands alone in admitting the fraud and that an accounting is due."  He also added, "As welcome as it is, much of what's in the Post's Editorial is arrogant ad hoc rationalizing. They think a story is only confirmed once the NYT & WP say so - lol. The evidence of the archive's authenticity was overwhelming from the start. Many of us staked our careers on it."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Although the Post did not offer solutions or retribution for reports on the Hunter Biden laptop, it did admit fault in suppressing an otherwise accurate and relevant story prior to the 2020 election.  "None of these dilemmas have easy answers. The lesson learned from 2016 was evidently to err on the side of setting aside questionable material in the heat of a political campaign. The lesson learned from 2020 may well be that there’s also a danger of suppressing accurate and relevant stories," the editorial board concluded.

Since the beginning of the year, liberal media networks MSNBC, CNN, NBC, CBS, and ABC have expressed concerns that the GOP will triumph over Democrats in the 2022 midterms, with many hosts asking how President Biden can save the party from an impending bloodbath.  On March 23, The New York Times published an op-ed in which columnist Thomas B. Edsall asserted that Democrats are making it too easy for Republicans to claim victory and slammed liberals for turning away from the working class while tolerating brazen crime.  Meanwhile, on the March 30 airing of MSNBC’s "Meet the Press Daily,", host Chuck Todd sounded the alarm on Democrats’ dwindling chances of victory in November with a "Midterm meter" that placed the president’s party in the "shellacking" category, below bad, decent, and exceptional.  NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED STATES DEMOCRATS' ARE MAKING IT TOO EASY FOR REPUBLICANS TO WIN IN THE MIDTERMS  This is not the first time that Todd has attempted to highlight Democrats’ poor odds.  A few days earlier, Todd was speaking with NBC News correspondent Yamiche Alcindor on "Meet the Press," and made note of an NBC poll that saw registered voters show preference for Republican control (46%) of Congress over Democrats (44%). A Republican polling lead on the generic ballot, as Todd noted, has not occurred on NBC polls since 2014.  "This is a huge red flag," Todd told Alcindor, to which she agreed.  In January, while speaking with Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., Todd asked what he needs from Biden to improve the Democrats’ chances in 2022.  Other hosts also echoed similar questions on how the Democrat Party can improve their position before the midterm election.  ABC News host George Stephanopoulos asked Vice President Kamala Harris about Biden and the Democrats’ dire poll numbers and how the president can reverse course.  "Can the president provide the kind of relief that is necessary to prevent a Democratic rout in November," he asked in March.  "What can President Biden do [to change the minds of voters]—still a lot of time, but time is drawing near before the midterm," CBS Mornings co-host Tony Dokoupil similarly asked correspondent Robert Costa.  MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell unabashedly asked a guest whether the war in Ukraine was "at least helping the Democrats" and the White House heading into the midterms.  Some media figures went a step further, worrying that a Republican win could be the end of America and voting rights, while also in one instance, preemptively accusing them of cheating.  CNN global affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga discussed a poll conducted by the network in which only 43% of Democrats had "extremely or very high enthusiasm" about voting in the midterms versus 51% of Republicans. Golodryga questioned why voters weren't more concerned with voting rights and the "threat to democratic values."  "Given this ongoing threat to democratic values, right, shouldn’t voters be more determined to go to the polls and why do you think you’re seeing that reluctance and the lack of enthusiasm?," she asked a panel of guests.  On ABC, "The View" co-host Joy Behar said she would be "very worried" if Republicans take over the House and the Senate following the midterms, claiming that it would spell doom for the U.S.  "That would be the end of the country—the beginning of the end for this country," she said in Janurary.  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., made a similar comment when he told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes that a Republican sweep in the midterms would end "voting as we know it."  On MSNBC and CBS, frequent fill-in host Jason Johnson and guest Ian Bremmer both said Republican victories in November would be the result of cheating, or at least give of the impression of an illegitimate election.  "[A] key thing to understand why Republicans are optimists for next year, even if they're sort of waving themselves and wrapping themselves in a Trump burrito, is they’re going to cheat," Johnson said on MSNBC.  Ian Bremmer was less explicit in his perception of the upcoming elections.  "The United States has an election process that is increasingly broken, increasingly delegitimized. In the midterm elections especially, if you have a significant win for a Trump-led Republican Party, means that 2024 is going to be seen as illegitimate and potentially a constitutional crisis," Bremmer said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  In an early snapshot of the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans maintain a narrow advantage over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot -- as voters say they are less likely to support a candidate endorsed by either President Biden or former President Trump, according to the latest Fox News survey of registered voters.  If the election for Congress were today, 49% would vote for the Republican candidate in their district, while 45% would go for the Democrat, according to a Fox News poll of registered voters. This is the third straight month when the GOP has had the advantage: Republicans held a 1-point edge last month (44% vs. 43%) and were up by 4 points in December (43% vs. 39%).

EXCLUSIVE: First-time Senate candidate and Army veteran Sam Brown spotlights his recovery from serious injuries he suffered in the War in Afghanistan and emphasizes that America "needs healing now" in his first statewide ad blitz in his bid for the GOP nomination in the crucial swing state of Nevada.  "I wasn’t born into power. I’m from small town America where duty and service still matter," Brown says in his new commercial, which was shared first nationally with Fox News on Monday.  NEVADA GOP SENATE PRIMARY: BROWN HAULS IN $1 MILLION FOR SECOND QUARTER IN A ROW  Brown is seen hiking in the mountains just outside of Reno, Nevada, in the spot, and it includes a photo of a very young Brown with his father, who served more than three decades in the military and deployed to Afghanistan in 2003.  The younger Brown is a retired Army captain and a Purple Heart recipient who sustained serious injuries from an IED explosion during a 2008 deployment in Afghanistan, which left his face severely burned.  GOP SENATE CANDIDATE SAM BROWN FIRES BACK AT TWITTER  "After West Point, I served in Afghanistan, where a Taliban bomb nearly killed me. After 30 surgeries, years of recovery, turns out I’m hard to kill," he says in his ad. "I built a family, a small business, a grassroots movement. It’s America that needs healing now. Career politicians can’t fix Washington. They broke it. I’m Sam Brown and I approve this message. It’s time for new conservative leadership for the people."  Brown’s campaign tells Fox News that they’re spending six figures to run the commercial statewide in Nevada through the state’s primary on June 14. Brown raised eyebrows by hauling in just over $1 million in both the third and fourth quarters of fundraising last year.  TRUMP-BACKED LAXALT HAULS IN $1.35 MILLION IN FOURTH QUARTER  Brown is running for the GOP Senate nomination in a crowded field that also includes former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, an Iraq War veteran and grandson of the late Nevada governor and senator Paul Laxalt, who has plenty of name recognition and is the primary front-runner in both polling and fundraising.

But they also see strong pickup potentials in Nevada, as well as three other swing states – Arizona, Georgia and New Hampshire.

In a recent opinion piece, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman claimed that the ongoing war in Ukraine is the first "real" World War.  The column, originally headlined "Ukraine Is the First Real World War," was highlighted on both The New York Times’ and Friedman’s Twitter accounts Sunday. Both tweets can still be viewed; however, the column has since been given a new headline on the Times’ website.  The article is now headlined, "Putin Had No Clue How Many of Us Would Be Watching."  NYT OP-ED CLAIMS SENATORS VOTING AGAINST KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 'COMPLICIT' IN HER 'ABUSE'  "Almost six weeks into the war between Russia and Ukraine, I’m beginning to wonder if this conflict isn’t our first true world war — much more than World War I or World War II ever were," Friedman wrote in the opening of the column.  Friedman then goes on to dub the war "World War Wired" because "virtually everyone on the planet" can either participate in or be affected by the war on a "granular level," noting the economic impacts of the conflict.  The Times columnist added that "everyone is watching," and that unlike World War I and II, wherein those outside of the war zone were "extremely poor" and "subsistence farmers" minimally impacted by the war, now everyone has a smartphone and access to social networks through which to experience the war in our "giant connected globalized and urbanized" world.  In 2014, following the takeover of Iraqi city Mosul by Sunni extremists, Friedman wrote the "real war of ideas" was not religious ideology, but rather the war between "religious extremists" and "committed environmentalists."  He asserted at the time that this war, which could lead to an "ecological disaster zone," was the only conflict "worth taking sides on."

Swaths of Europe are rushing to stake their energy independence and spur an energy revolution after natural gas powerhouse Russia invaded Ukraine.  "We must become independent from Russian oil, coal and gas. We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us. We need to act now to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, diversify our gas supply for next winter and accelerate the clean energy transition," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month.  The Netherlands, France, Poland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy are all ramping up their energy sectors, including by expanding their wind, solar and nuclear energy options.  RUSSIA DUPED EUROPE INTO ENERGY DEPENDENCE BY FUNDING 'RABID ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS': EXPERTS  Germany is Europe’s biggest gas guzzling country, and is working to speed up its wind and solar energy projects. Officials said this week they’re aiming to end the use of Russian oil and coal this year and natural gas by mid-2024.  While in Italy, the first wind farm in the Mediterranean is being built, and Rome officials are working to end the import of Russian gas by 2025. In Britain, Russian oil will be phased out by the end of this year, and officials are working on a plan to drastically expand their wind farms, as well as their nuclear power capabilities.  Russia’s grip on Europe’s energy sector has tightened in recent years, as European nations shunned fracking in their own countries, largely in response to climate activists, according to experts.  EUROPE'S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES STRENGTHENED PUTIN, MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER SAYS  "Fifteen years ago, Europe produced more natural gas than Russia," Michael Shellenberger, author of "Apocalypse Never," told Fox News earlier this month. "Today, Russia exports three times more natural gas to Europe than Europe produces."  By this year, the European Union was importing 90% of its natural gas, 45% of which was from Russia, according to the European Commission. All in, about 45% of both Europe’s oil imports and coal imports come from Russia.  But the reliance began unraveling on Feb. 24, when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.  Poland announced just last week that it will cut Russian oil and coal imports by the end of the year, with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki describing the move as "the most radical plan in Europe."  REPUBLICANS CALL ON YELLEN TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER RUSSIAN MONEY FINANCED USA GREEN GROUPS  Poland's announcement comes as the European Union has so far declined to sanction energy because it deeply depends on Moscow for fuel needed for everything from cars to heating homes.  "We are not at war with ourselves," Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo argued at an EU summit in Brussels last week. "Sanctions must always have a much bigger impact on the Russian side than on ours."  Russia’s currency almost fully recovered its value as of the end of March, despite weeks of the crippling sanctions, as it relies on energy exports as well as currency controls.  "There was an immediate shock or reaction from the Russian market and the markets outside Russia, which is why we saw this immediate legitimate panic and legitimate downturn," Anthony Kim, a research fellow in economic freedom at the Heritage Foundation, recently told FOX Business. "And where we are now is a different kind of period."  RUSSIAN RUBLE MAKES ALMOST FULL RECOVERY DESPITE WESTERN SANCTIONS  The ruble has recovered some of its lost value, with $1 equal to around 83 RUB as of Thursday. The exchange rate prior to the invasion saw $1 equal to roughly 83.53 RUB.  "I think it’s just part of the process … I don’t think this is any meaningful recovery, it’s an ongoing process," Kim said. "What’s more important and more critical is the next step."

Conservatives used to note that Democrats who wanted to dictate the size of your soda cup were creating a "nanny state." But now, Democrats aren’t content to just be nannies. They want to be your child’s parent – and they think you should have no say in the matter.  That’s the debate happening in Florida right now. Leftists are outraged about the new Florida law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis protecting parental rights, dishonestly dubbed "Don’t Say Gay." Even Disney – a company that has a significant role in influencing kids through entertainment – has made headlines for condemning the legislation as activist employees at the company attempt to turn it into a propaganda arm for the far-left.  This follows an unfortunate pattern of the ultra-woke attempting to reshape American institutions to fit their warped, extreme worldview.  TOP 10 REASONS DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE POWER IN NOVEMBER  But let’s be clear: Florida’s new law never even mentions the word "gay." Rather, it bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades for kids aged 5 to 8 – something polling shows most Americans support.  A survey by The Daily Wire found that 67% of Americans agreed the move would rightly "protect children from inappropriate topics that should be discussed by parents." A different poll showed even Florida Democrats agree with the legislation when it is described accurately.  As a mom, I’m sure that other parents agree: Schools should teach young kids about the A-B-Cs, not S-E-X.  But for Democrats, that’s unacceptable. The "experts," they claim, know what’s best for your child. Whether it’s woke corporations or political activists, it’s just the latest example of Democrats putting their far-left agenda over kids’ best interests.  When kids are in the classroom, they’re being indoctrinated with anti-American and sexually-explicit propaganda.  The controversy isn’t about the specific contents of the bill so much as the fact that it dares to assert parental authority over school boards, activists, and government bureaucrats. Democrats have come to feel a sense of entitlement toward other people’s children. Just look at how they treated kids during the pandemic.  For more than a year, Democrats kept kids out of the classroom. They shut down schools, forced our children to learn online and mandated masks for toddlers. The Biden administration even colluded with teachers’ union bosses to keep schools closed. And children are suffering.  More than 97% of educators "saw some learning loss" over the past year. A McKinsey report found that students will lose around $60,000 in lifetime earnings due to the loss of learning last year. Black students will be most affected: the same study projected a 3.3% loss of income a year in their adult lives.  When kids are in the classroom, they’re being indoctrinated with anti-American and sexually-explicit propaganda. More than 4,500 teachers all over the country have used curriculum inspired by The New York Times’ 1619 Project, the "reframing" of American history that claims our country is inherently racist, which has since been debunked by historians.  And, yes, despite what the mainstream media might tell you, kids are also being deluged with inappropriate gender and sexual content.  Last month, a school district in Wisconsin outrageously stated that parents are "not entitled" to know their children’s sexuality. The New York Department of Education is drawing heat for promoting explicit sexual books to its high school students. In Los Angeles, teachers who refuse to use trans pronouns for young children are being targeted by school administrators. In Oregon, the statewide public school system has passed guidance promoting kids as young as kindergarten using gender pronouns of their choice.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  This is happening nationwide. No amount of misrepresentation from the left and their allies in the media can erase what the left is trying to do to our kids.  It’s no wonder why Democrats don’t want parents to know what goes in on classrooms. That’s why teachers in Loudoun County, Virginia, created a secret Facebook group to attack concerned parents. The Biden administration tracked moms and dads who spoke up at school board meetings with an FBI "threat tag" despite previously claiming they weren’t using tools usually reserved for domestic terrorists.  That kind of threatening behavior toward parents who care about their kids doesn’t work. Don’t believe me? Just ask Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Democrats who are putting indoctrination and sexualization over education – and cutting parents out in the process – are setting themselves up to fail. It’s not just bad politics. It’s a disgrace.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Meanwhile, Republicans stand for parents being involved in their kids’ education and protecting children from the left’s inappropriate agenda, whether it’s in the classroom or in the movies they watch. That’s a message that will prove successful in midterms and beyond.  Democrats are about to learn a lesson the hard way: Don’t mess with moms.

To quote Larry Kudlow: The cavalry is coming!  Campaign gurus say Republicans are a lock to win control of the House in November and have a good shot of taking back the Senate as well. They cite:  1. Joe Biden’s abysmal approval ratings – the worst of any post-war president at this point in his presidency other than Donald Trump. Moreover, they say, a president’s standing almost never improves meaningfully between March 31 and November; what’s done is done.  TOP 10 REASONS DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE POWER IN NOVEMBER  2. The GOP, according to internal polling, enjoys an unprecedented 17-point enthusiasm advantage. Republicans are riled up and cannot wait to cast a ballot; they are lining up to protest rising inflation, surging crime, the chaotic border, and other burning issues where they judge Democrats, led by Biden, to be failing.  3. Gallup reports that the number of voters who self-identify as Republicans jumped from 40% in January 2021 to 47% at the end of the year, while those saying they are Democrats plunged from 49% to 42% – an historic swing of 14 points that augurs well for the Grand Old Party. Gallup said of the survey: "The Republicans last held a five-point advantage in party identification and leaning in early 1995, after winning control of the House of Representatives for the first time since the 1950s."  4. Glenn Younkin’s election last fall in Virginia’s gubernatorial contest, Republican candidate John Luhan flipping a blue seat in Texas District 118, and the shocking win of Ann Davison to become Seattle’s city attorney – the first Republican to serve in that post for three decades – confirm a nationwide shift to the right.  5. According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Republicans now have a 4-point advantage in the "generic ballot", which is unusual; generally, the GOP trails Democrats by 4-5 points.  6. Thirty-one Democrat legislators are quitting their seats, either to retire from public office or run for another post. That’s a good sign; they know what’s coming.  This is excellent news. Once in the majority in one or both houses of Congress, Republicans can kill off Biden’s extreme Leftist agenda for good.  But …  There is always plenty to worry about. For starters, Democrats are up to their usual tricks.  While the Senate outlook remains dicey for a GOP takeover, Republicans are talking optimistically about picking up 40 or even 50 seats in the House and gaining a majority. That seems like a landslide until you remember that in 2010, midway through Barack Obama’s first term in office, Republicans won 63 seats, delivering what the president himself called a "shellacking."  Why are expectations more modest this year, even as Joe Biden is not nearly as popular as Obama was heading into his first midterm? Partly because since Obama’s presidency, perhaps stung by that 2012 outcome, Democrats are using the most recent census to redraw voting maps with a vengeance.  Democrats are using the most recent census to redraw voting maps with a vengeance.  For instance, Democrats in New York ignored voters’ preference for a nonpartisan redistricting commission and instead created their own, highly preferential new voting map. Their proposal would have effectively eliminated any hope of GOP victories in 22 of 26 seats. A Republican judge slapped down the "biased" gerrymandering, rightly calling it a "scourge" on democracy.  Democrats have appealed the verdict, hoping to eliminate half of the eight Republicans currently representing New York in the House, out of a total of 27. That’s one way of protecting your majority.  In Maryland, too, a judge has tossed out Democrat-friendly redistricting. In that blue state, only one Republican currently serves in the House; the redrawing of voter maps would have pushed thousands of Democrat voters into his district, making reelection virtually impossible. Democrat officials have appealed the decision.  Both parties are using redistricting to further their goals, but the Democrat-led effort has been bigger and bolder. Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, told The Hill, "Democrats have been more aggressive this cycle," explaining that whereas in the past they used the tactic to preserve blue seats, now they are moving to eliminate Republicans altogether.  Eric Holder and President Obama spearheaded the push to redraw state lines heading into the 2020 elections. By the end of 2019, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC), which Holder heads, had raised $52 million in three short years for a cause not on most voters’ radar. Open Secrets reports that "Billionaire Democratic donor George Soros was the single largest contributor to the committee in 2018, giving $2.6 million."    Today, their work – and fundraising – continues. The Washington Free Beacon reported in February that a judge in North Carolina who was expected to rule on that states’ redrawn map had received $200,000 in campaign funds from Holder’s group.  Ironically, both Obama and Holder have complained about GOP redistricting efforts, citing map changes in numerous states, including Alabama. Notably, the Supreme Court upheld the Alabama effort, which leaves the GOP advantage in the state unchanged.  The Supreme Court also rejected a partisan redistricting by Democrat Governor Tony Evers in Wisconsin, saying it did not comply with the Voting Rights Act and sending the case back to the state court for a redo.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The GOP countered the Obama-Holder NDRC by founding the National Republican Redistricting PAC in 2017. That outfit raised significantly less money than its Democratic counterpart in 2020, bringing in just over $19,700. On this type of "in the weeds" political activism, the GOP often appears to lag behind.  Perhaps as a result, Democrats have won more seats than Republicans this year through redistricting efforts, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.

Colorado statewide races have trended Democratic since 2006, with the lone exception of Cory Gardner’s U.S. Senate victory in 2014, but a Republican running for Senate this year told Fox News Digital that the transgender sports issue – best typified by NCAA swimming champion Lia Thomas – may prove vital in turning this mostly blue state red in the 2022 midterm election.  Eli Bremer, a former Olympian who joined the effort to reform the U.S. Olympic Committee in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, said the transgender sports issue can flip the tables on Democrats' "war on women" rhetoric. He faulted Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., for not getting involved in the effort to pass the reform bill S. 2330, even though Bennet serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Olympic and Paralympic Caucus. A spokesperson for Bennet's U.S. Senate office contested the claim that Bennet insufficiently fought for women after the Nassar scandal, noting that Bennet voted (in a voice vote) for S. 2330 and pointing to a separate bill the senator cosponsored at the time.  FORMER OLYMPIAN SLAMS KETANJI BROWN JACKSON'S REFUSAL TO DEFINE ‘WOMAN’ AMID LIA THOMAS CONTROVERSY  "This is a lethal issue for Michael Bennett because historically Democrats have said that Republicans are the ones who don’t stand up for women, but the tables are completely turned now," Bremer told Fox News Digital. "I am a Republican who helped lead the efforts to end sexual abuse in the Olympics, and now I’m leading on this issue."  "Michael Bennett refuses to stand with women," the Republican added. "This could be a defining issue in the November election."  Bennet supports H.R. 5, The Equality Act, which expands federal civil rights protections to people who identify as transgender, including in the arena of sports. He commemorated the Transgender Day of Visibility last week.  Bremer described the issue of transgender identity as a "tsunami coming in," noting that schools across the country have started to encourage boys and girls who express confusion about their gender to embrace a transgender identity. Gender centers have reported several-thousand-percent increases in youth presenting gender distress.  Lia Thomas, who won the 500-yard freestyle competing against women at the NCAA championship last month, had competed as a male before competing against women, and had ranked No. 462 in men's swimming, according to Thomas' female teammates.  "I think most Democrats know this is wrong," Bremer told Fox News. "The Left is looking more and more absurd when they come out and say Lia Thomas has no advantage. You can’t deny that a biological male has an advantage, especially post-pubescent."  GOP CANDIDATES STAND WITH WOMEN DEFEATED BY LIA THOMAS, CONDEMNING ‘THE DEATH OF WOMEN’S SPORTS'  "I will say that federal legislation should be based on biology, not identity," the candidate insisted.  Bremer said that his campaign's internal polling suggests that people "viscerally" understand this issue, and that the vast majority of Republicans and unaffiliated voters agree that males who identify as transgender women should not be allowed to compete against women in sports. Even "about half of Democrats said that they had a problem with it, too," the candidate added.  Colorado is known for its fitness culture, and one of the two U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Training Centers is based in Colorado Springs.  "I feel very comfortable in saying that while there’s a lot of support for people who are transitioning, there’s just not the same support for hurting little girls in sports," Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute, a Colorado-based think tank, told Fox News Digital. "This is an unfair competition. Lia Thomas – the guy was something like 440th in the nation as a young man and number 1 as someone who identifies as a woman."  "For people who say they’re concerned for equity, there’s no equity in that," Caldara added. "That’s just cruel. It’s anti-female. I think girls deserve to have their own sports, and I think most of Colorado does, too."  KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, BIDEN'S SUPREME COURT PICK, REFUSES TO DEFINE THE WORD ‘WOMAN’  Deborah Flora, another Republican candidate in the Senate race, also agreed with Bremer that the issue resonates.  "Female athletes who have worked hard their entire lives losing to biological males is capturing the attention of people of common sense everywhere," Flora told Fox News Digital. "The vast majority of Americans know it is fundamentally unfair because biological males have physical advantages that hormone blockers cannot mitigate including: larger lungs, lower oxygen requirements, a larger heart and circulatory system, not to mention muscle mass and development. The is science is clear."  Flora went on to reference "the elimination of privacy and threat to personal safety for women and girls in locker rooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms," and said she has been "fighting against these policies in schools."  "I challenge Democrat Michael Bennett to stand up for these young women- to say enough is enough," she added. "In his stead, as Senator, I will stand up for what is fair and right and help restore common sense to Washington."  Bennet's campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, but his Senate office commented on Bennet's history on the Larry Nassar issue.  "Senator Bennet supported S. 2330 when it passed the Senate unanimously," a spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "Senator Bennet also cosponsored the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act, which was a targeted response in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal. That bill also passed the Senate unanimously."  "In 2018, Senator Bennet met with Sarah Hirschland, CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, to discuss the Committee’s reform efforts," the spokesperson added. "Senator Bennet has said and strongly believes that anyone who knew about the accusations against Larry Nassar and failed to act should be held accountable."  A person involved in the negotiations of S. 2330 told Fox News that then-Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., spearheaded the bill. The person verified Bremer's claim that Bennet did not have a hand in the drafting and progression of the bill, but the source said that Bennet did not need to get involved because he was not on the committee of jurisdiction for the bill. The source added that committees like the Olympics Committee "don't do much."  A separate person involved in promoting S. 2330 in Colorado highlighted Bremer's role in the process and questioned why Bennet did not get involved.  "If you’re touting yourself as the chair of the Olympic Caucus, and you represent the state with all the Olympic activity in it, shouldn’t you be involved?" the source asked in comments to Fox News Digital.

Is America serious about survival in this increasingly dangerous world? President Joe Biden’s $5.8 trillion budget says no. So does the recent $1.5 trillion earmark-filled spending bill. They send the message that America doesn’t care about the fiscal sanity and economic strength on which our national security depends.  There is never a good time to send that signal. But the worst time is right now, as Russia invades Ukraine and threatens nuclear war, and China aims to dominate the world. Instead of preparing to defend our freedom and vital interests, President Biden and Congress are undermining the domestic foundations of our global leadership. Their failure puts our future at risk.  LIBERAL JOURNALIST BLASTS ‘TIMID MODERATE’ BIDEN, SAYS BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL LEAD TO ‘RED WAVE’ IN MIDTERMS  That’s the essential point of Biden’s budget. It hikes federal spending by a third compared to pre-pandemic levels, doubling down on the debt and deficits that are destroying opportunity for our children and grandchildren. He’s also demanding $2.5 trillion in tax hikes, which will undermine our economy for generations to come. And then there’s the recent spending bill, which brought back earmarks – more than 4,000 of them, in fact. They are the grease to Washington’s spending wheel, which is spinning faster than ever and set to get worse. Overspending is clearly a bipartisan pandemic.  We know where this story ends: A bankrupt America. Earmarks encourage both Republicans and Democrats to support the very spending hikes Joe Biden is calling for in his budget, because hey, at least they’re getting something. Yet the national debt stands at more than $30 trillion – having tripled in just over a decade – and it’s set to rise by at least a trillion dollars a year without end. Washington’s spending binge was dangerous before earmarks came back. Now it’s set to reach a new low, and the national debt a new high, since both parties have a reason to put selfish desires before America’s security demands.  This is not a recipe for national success, much less survival. Not when Russia is attacking Europe and China is advancing on every front. More spending and debt mean less money for the military, which needs a much larger investment than Biden has called for to contain and deter Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. And a deeper fiscal hole has a devastatingly high economic cost.  The national debt takes us nowhere, but it comes from somewhere, and that’s the American people. Washington spending has already driven inflation to a 40-year high, and while the short-term harm to families is steep, the long-term consequences will take us over a cliff. Every dollar we add to the debt comes out of the people’s pockets, leading to weaker businesses, lower wages, and a smaller economy overall. Add in Biden’s tax hikes, and Americans will suffer even more.  How can we stay ahead of our enemies if we’re falling behind economically? How can we beat China, which is getting stronger by the day, if we’re on track to get weaker? China’s economy may surpass America’s within the next few years, yet rather than prevent that, our leaders are working hard to make it happen sooner.  This has to stop. Fiscal sanity and economic strength are foundational to national security, but Washington is too distracted to realize it. Instead of bringing back earmarks and doubling down on spending and debt, we should be getting spending under control. That means no new entitlements, no more "stimulus," and no more corporate welfare masquerading as "relief" or "infrastructure." We need to fundamentally change how Washington spends, before Washington’s spending fundamentally changes us.  Restoring fiscal sanity is necessary, but it isn’t sufficient. Equally important is restoring free-market capitalism to spark an economic boom. That starts by getting government out of the way of job-seekers and entrepreneurs through top-to-bottom regulatory and tax reform. It also means tapping America’s incredible energy resources. We should drill our own oil before buying a drop from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, or any other enemy – the opposite of President Biden’s approach. A country that wants to defend itself doesn’t pay regimes that want to destroy it.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  We must also be smarter about who we trade with. Trade with China in advanced technology and dependence on China for essential supplies such as medicine must end. We should reinvigorate trade with our friends by forging better deals with the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, Japan, the European Union, and freedom-loving countries worldwide. The alternative is to keep empowering regimes that want to end freedom and spread tyranny worldwide. Let them trade with each other; we don’t want what they’re selling.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  These are the urgent priorities that demand attention from the White House and Congress. Instead, our leaders are focused on unaffordable spending and unjustifiable earmarks. Their short-sightedness threatens our fiscal solvency, our economic strength, and ultimately, our national security. We need leaders who are serious about protecting America, before it’s too late.

Lady Gaga was in tears after performing an emotional tribute to her pal Tony Bennett.  The singer, who was introduced by the music icon during the Grammys on Sunday in a pre-taped video, performed a rendition of "Do I Love You" and "Love for Sale" alongside a big band arrangement.  After her heartfelt performance, which was paired with a video montage of the pair sharing the stage, the singer, whose birth name is Stefani Germanotta, sat on the edge of the stage and cried.  "I love you, Tony, I miss you," said the 36-year-old, who was met with a standing ovation from the audience.  ETIQUETTE EXPERT SAYS WE'VE OVERLOOKED LADY GAGA'S GREAT KINDNESS TOWARD LIZA MINNELLI  The 95-year-old revealed he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2021. The crooner retired from performing a few months later. Bennett and Gaga were nominated for five Grammys this year, including album of the year and traditional pop vocal album for "Love for Sale."  On Friday, Bennett’s son Danny told Variety in a statement that his famous father wouldn’t be joining his beloved duet partner for her Grammys performance.  "Although the producers had invited both Tony and Gaga to perform in Sunday’s Grammys broadcast, it is unfortunate that due to his continuing struggle with Alzheimer’s, he was not able to accept," he shared at the time. "It was decided that it would be fitting for Lady Gaga to perform on her own to represent for both of them."

"He will be cheering her on as he watches from his home in New York City."  Bennett gained his first pop success in the early 1950s. He enjoyed a career revival in the 1990s and became popular with younger audiences in part because of an appearance on "MTV Unplugged." He continued recording and touring constantly, and his 2014 collaboration with Lady Gaga, "Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek," debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts.

Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue warned on "Fox & Friends Weekend" Sunday that the war between Russia and Ukraine is having a "devastating effect" on food supply as shortages are expected to contribute to higher inflation.  President Biden said last month that a food shortage is "gonna be real" following the sanctions that were placed on Russia by the U.S. government as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion into Ukraine.  "With regard to food shortage, yes we did talk about food shortages, and it's gonna be real," Biden said during a press conference at a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, following a meeting with other world leaders.  "The price of the sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia," he added. "It’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well."  In response, Unanue told co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy, Sunday, that "there are two wars raging."  RISING FOOD COSTS POUNDING SHOPPERS' WALLETS; 'NO CHOICE' BUT TO INCREASE PRICES: GOYA CEO  "The first war is a war on fossil fuels and that has sent inflation skyrocketing," he said. "We are pacing seven, eight, nine, now 13% per month in our foods." He also noted that "the cost of transportation has affected every facet of the economy."  Unanue argued that the "other war is the war in Ukraine where they make a fertilizer, they make corn [and] wheat."  Russia and Ukraine account for around 29% of global wheat exports, 19% of global corn supplies, and 80% of the world’s sunflower oil exports. This reliance has many traders worried that any further military force could trigger a massive scramble by food importers to replace supplies normally sourced from the Black Sea region.  Russia is also one of the world’s biggest exporters of all three major groups of fertilizers.  "They also have sand for glass and also for fracking," Unanue said, speaking of Russia and Ukraine. He said that "that’s all being blocked in the ports of Odessa," which is impacting supply and prices.  While he stressed that the war "is having a devastating effect on supply," he argued that "the real problem" with the supply chain started with the COVID lockdowns.  FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN'S INFLATION TROUBLES PERSIST AS VOTERS CITE HIGH GAS PRICES, SPENDING WOES  Inflation hit a fresh 40-year high in February with the consumer price index climbing 7.9% on an annual basis, according to data released last month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Month over month, inflation rose 0.8%.  The year-over-year reading is in line with estimates and compares with an annual 7.5% jump in January, marking the fastest increase since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.6%.  From January to February, nearly every category of goods and services got pricier. Gas jumped 6.6% and accounted for almost a third of price hikes. Grocery costs jumped 1.4%, the sharpest one-month increase since 1990, other than during a pandemic-induced price surge two years ago. The cost of fruits and vegetables rose 2.3%, the largest monthly increase since 2010.  For the 12 months ending in February, grocery prices leaped 8.6%, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1981, the government said. Gas prices are up a whopping 38%. And housing costs have risen 4.7%, the largest yearly jump since 1991.    Inflation data for March will be released next week. The February data, the latest data currently available, was taken before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed prices for some commodities higher. The costs of wheat, corn, cooking oils and such metals as aluminum and nickel have soared since the war began as Ukraine and Russia are leading exporters of those commodities.    As inflation rises, meat and poultry prices are largely expected to continue their climb in the U.S. this year, according to a new analysis.  Evercore ISI issued a protein inflation note last week projecting that most protein prices are forecasted to increase "substantially" due to the higher feed costs, with chicken breast reaching as high as 70% year-over-year in the first half of 2022.  Unanue noted on "Fox & Friends Weekend" that beans are a good protein substitute for those trying to save amid the inflationary environment.  "Usually the red, the black, they are hire in antioxidants," he said. "Beans have protein, fiber, antioxidants vital nutrients and when you combine [them] with rice you get a complete protein."

Ukrainian troops are finding brutalized bodies and widespread destruction in suburbs of the capital as Russian soldiers withdraw and Moscow focuses its attacks elsewhere, including missile strikes Sunday that targeted fuel and ammunition supplies in southern and eastern Ukraine.  Associated Press journalists in Bucha, a small city northwest of Kyiv, saw the bodies of at least nine people in civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. The AP also saw two bodies wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and thrown into a ditch.  Authorities said they were documenting evidence as Ukraine’s military reclaims territory and discovers indications of execution-style slayings to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR OUTCOME COULD BE DETERMINED IN NEXT 'WEEK OR TWO': UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL  Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of killed civilians were found on the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a "scene from a horror movie."  Arestovych said some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning.  The capital city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said civilians were "shot with joined hands" and told German newspaper Bild that "what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide."  A day earlier, AP journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal. Local residents said the dead people were civilians killed without provocation, a claim that could not be independently verified.  Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the invasion of Ukraine, now in its 39th day.  "Not a penny should go to Russia anymore. That’s bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately," the mayor said.  UKRAINE IMMIGRANT WISHES DEMISE OF PUTIN AS CHILD DEATHS RISE IN WAR-TORN COUNTRY  Charles Michel, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter that he was shocked by the "haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army" in the capital region. The EU and non-governmental organizations were assisting in the effort to preserve evidence of war crimes, according to Michel, who promised "further EU sanctions" against Russia.  On Sunday morning, Russian forces launched an airstrike on the Black Sea port of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa, which is Ukraine’s largest port and home to its navy.  "I live in that eight-floor building. At 6 in the morning, Russia launched an attack, and this piece of rock reached my house," said Maiesienko Ilia, who lives near one of the targeted facilities.  The Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack.  The smaller port of Mariupol, located to the east on the Sea of Azov, remained cut off from the rest of the country as Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fought for control of the besieged city. About 100,000 civilians – less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000 – are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine,  The International Committee of the Red Cross said it hoped a team of nine staffers and three vehicles it sent Saturday to help evacuate residents would reach Mariupol on Sunday but cautioned, "The situation on the ground is volatile and subject to rapid changes."  FORMER UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT SHARES WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO STOP PUTIN  Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, which has been the site of some of the worst attacks and greatest suffering, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling.  Mariupol is in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Its capture would create an unbroken land corridor from Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.  With Mariupol squarely in Russia’s crosshairs, Ukraine insisted it had gained a leg up elsewhere in the country. As his country’s troops retook territory north of the capital of Kyiv from departing Russian troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Ukrainians to do whatever they could "to foil the enemy’s tactics and weaken its capabilities."  "Peace will not be the result of any decisions the enemy makes somewhere in Moscow. There is no need to entertain empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only have peace by fighting," Zelenskyy said late Saturday.  Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s Western allies believe Russia has shifted its forces from the capital region and the country’s north in order to build strength in the east and south. The Ukrainian leader again urged the West to supply his military with warplanes and more anti-missile systems.  "Every Russian missile that hits our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended – the decision of whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons," Zelenskyy said.  GOP LAWMAKER BLASTS BIDEN'S 'SOFT POWER' DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION  While the geography of the battlefield morphed, little changed for many Ukrainians more than five weeks into a war that has sent more than 4 million people fleeing the country as refugees and displaced millions more from their homes.  The regional governor in Kharkiv, said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts in the country’s northeast over the past day. Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said a missile strike on the city of Lozovo wounded four people and that Russian tanks bombarded a hospital in the town of Balakliia.  Zelenskyy alleged Saturday that Russian troops have left mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even the bodies of the dead as they withdraw from around Kyiv. Those claims could not be independently verified, but Ukrainian troops were seen heeding the warning.  In towns and cities surrounding Kyiv, signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of the Russian redeployment. Destroyed armored vehicles from both armies lay in streets and fields along with scattered military gear.  Ukrainian troops were stationed at the entrance to Antonov Airport in the suburb of Hostomel, demonstrating control of the runway that Russia tried to storm in the first days of the war.  Inside the compound, the Mriya, one of the biggest planes ever built, lay wrecked underneath a hangar pockmarked with holes from the February attack.  UKRAINIAN FORCES RETAKE AREAS NEAR KYIV AMID FEAR OF TRAPS  The head of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia said Moscow’s negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during face-to-face talks in Istanbul this week, but no written confirmation has been provided.  The Ukrainian negotiator, Davyd Arakhamia said on Ukrainian TV that he hoped the draft was developed enough so that the two countries’ presidents can meet to discuss it. But the top Russian negotiator in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinksy, was quoted by Interfax as saying that it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the two leaders.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Ukrainian authorities warned that Russia’s focus on eastern Ukraine did not mean Kyiv and other cities wouldn’t become targets again. In his evening address Saturday, Zelenskyy called for his people to do whatever they can to ensure the country’s survival, even by engaging in acts as simple as showing each other kindness.  "When a nation is defending itself in a war of annihilation, when it is a question of life or death of millions, there are no unimportant things. ... And everyone can contribute to a victory for all," the president said.

Ukraine presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych described the importance of the ongoing struggle over the port city of Mariupol, saying its salvation or fall could determine the eventual outcome of the war, Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform reported.  Russia's lack of swift victory, international condemnation, and economic sanctions along with devastation and civilian losses across Ukraine have brought both countries to the negotiation table, but fighting — including a critical struggle for Mariupol — continues.

"The next week or two will be uneven," he added. "There will be reports that we are winning, counterattacking and repelling in some areas. We are liberating our lands from the enemy."  "However, there will also be information that in some parts of the front, particularly in the east, the situation is complicated. You need to be emotionally, organizationally and consciously ready for this," the adviser added.  WIDE RIFT IN RUSSIA, UKRAINE NEGOTIATIONS COULD MEAN DRAWN OUT WAR THAT FAVORS PUTIN: EXPERTS SAY  Should Ukrainian forces repel the Russian army from Eastern Ukraine and successfully defend Mariupol, it could have an advantage in negotiation efforts — or it could utilize the strategic city to ultimately emerge victorious in the war, the advisor speculated.  If Russia surrounds and is able to "finish" Mariupol, they would have a direct line from the Russian mainland to the Crimean Peninsula, in which Russian forces could be more quickly resupplied and reinforced, Arestovych said, according to the report.  "They understand this," the advisor said, speaking of both countries. "On the one hand, it gives us hope in the area of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy region, Kharkiv region that we will get rid of the enemy there, we will repel it from there. Secondly, it means a possible, potential deterioration or a sharp deterioration of the situation around Mariupol and in the JFO area."  ZELENSKYY SAYS MINES AFTER RUSSIAN RETREAT THREATEN KYIV  After Russia's military troops invaded Ukraine nearly 40 days ago, the larger army's might has been repeatedly stalled by Ukraine's military determination and will to save their homeland, resulting in a slowed attack and severe losses for Russia.  Across the country, in Northern Ukraine, the Ukrainian military is slowly retaking territories but troops have been forced to move cautiously through these areas as Russia's military left mines and other hostile devices before they vacated them, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.  The situation is "catastrophic," Zelenskyy said, as mines were discovered around civilian homes and abandoned equipment.

Let’s begin with an important truth. What’s happening in Ukraine today is the direct result of a Biden administration foreign policy that’s floundering on multiple fronts, and not just in Europe.  In Afghanistan, in Asia, in the Middle East, even along our southern border; we are witnessing a White House that’s trying to react to crises as they happen, instead of thinking through to a more comprehensive solution to America’s weakening position around the world.  It’s time for a resolute reset of America’s strategy for confronting the new totalitarians of the 21st century.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Because whatever the outcome of the war in Ukraine, it is just the latest round in a concerted, totalitarian assault on freedom and its allies around the world—an assault led by three revisionist powers, Russia, China, and Iran, determined to overthrow the post-World War II liberal world order.  In fact, during Russian foreign minister Alexei Lavrov’s visit to China on Wednesday Beijing spokesman Wang Wenbin said "China-Russia cooperation has no limits" in moving toward what Lavrov called "a multipolar, just, democratic world order"—meaning one without a United States to worry about.  I warned about this growing threat which I dubbed "The New Axis" in op-eds that ran in the Wall Street Journal in 2015 and again in 2019.  Now, everyone recognizes that what I predicted then is happening now, i.e. there is a coordinated de facto alliance of these three powers who are set on destabilizing the world from Ukraine and Taiwan to the Arabian Peninsula.  STAND WITH UKRAINE, DON'T SELL THEM OUT  Some have compared this conflict to a new Cold War. It has become far more serious than that, simply because the current White House seems paralyzed and unable to confront what is happening simultaneously on three fronts.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  Instead, we’ve seen a feckless incrementalism in dealing with the crisis in Ukraine; vague warnings about sanctions against China which President Xi can wave away; while the White House keeps trying to strike a nuclear deal with Iran that will almost certainly lead to war in the Middle East -- even as we denounce Putin as a war criminal on the one hand, and negotiate with him on the Iran deal on the other.  Some have compared this conflict to a new Cold War. It has become far more serious than that, simply because the current White House seems paralyzed and unable to confront what is happening simultaneously on three fronts.  Meanwhile, China continues to tighten its grip on Taiwan, while the White House refuses to call China out over COVID and Wall Street is free to do business as usual with Beijing.  Instead, the U.S. must take three steps to prevent this New Axis from blossoming into its World War Two version with war erupting not on one but three fronts.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The first is Strengthening/Expanding Alliances. That means expanding NATO to the north to include Sweden and Finland on Putin's northern doorstep, and building up our military posture in the Black Sea with NATO allies Bulgaria, Rumania, and Turkey.  It means building a strong Indo-Pacific alliance around the Quad alliance of U.S., Japan, Australia, and India which will include South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. It means restoring American support for the Israeli-Sunni alliance that is designed to check Iran's aggressive expansionism, including Saudi Arabia, while stopping the Iran nuclear deal cold.  The second step is fostering co-development of Advanced Weapons Systems with our trusted allies, so that our joint industrial and innovation bases can build a modern Arsenal of Democracies made of the weapons that will dominate the future battlefield, e.g. unmanned and robotic systems and hypersonics, together with securing trusted supply chains and cyber protections.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The third is advancing Technologies of the Future. Ultimately it is America’s innovation and productivity in the high-tech arena that will tip the balance in this global struggle, especially against China.  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  We need to make sure the U.S. and its allies invest in the emerging technologies that will allow us to leapfrog ahead of China in the high-tech sector, and disrupt Beijing's plans for a new world order. These include not only AI and cyber but quantum computers, space and 5/6G wireless technologies, and even cryptocurrencies.  Alliances, Co-Development, Technologies: together they form the appropriate acronym ACT. Because the US must act now in order to prevent tyranny from overwhelming freedom, not only in Ukraine but around the world—and to deter wars, rather than stumble into them on multiple fronts. The struggle with the New Axis has become global; we need to think globally, and act globally, if freedom has a chance at all.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ARTHUR HERMAN

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a virtual appearance during the 2022 Grammy Awards.  During a pre-taped appearance that aired on Sunday, Zelenskyy addressed the ongoing war with Russia, asking viewers for support in telling the story of Ukraine’s invasion by Russia.  Zelenskyy likened the invasion to a deadly silence threatening to extinguish the dreams and lives of the Ukrainian people, including children.  "The war doesn't let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence," the Ukrainian president began. "Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway."  He noted, "We defend our freedom. To live. To love. To sound."  GRAMMYS BEGINS IN MEMORIAM SEGMENT BY PAYING TRIBUTE TO TAYLOR HAWKINS  Zelenskyy went on to add, "On our land, we are fighting Russia which brings horrible silence with its bombs. The dead silence. Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today. Tell our story."  Zelenskyy also added, "Support us in any way you can. Any - but not silence."  According to Variety, Zelenskyy filmed the pre-taped segment within the last 48 hours from a bunker in Kyiv.  "On our land, we are fighting Russia which brings horrible silence with its bombs. The dead silence. Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today. Tell our story." — President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy  Zelenskyy's appearance was followed by a performance led by John Legend and Ukrainian musicians, Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton, as well as poet Lyuba Yakimchuk.  Images from the war were shown on screens behind them.  Newton sang "Free" by Legend alongside Iglidan. Newton is from Burstyn, Ukraine. The Grammys went on to mention that her sister is currently back home serving in the Ukraine army as they fight against Russia.  During the performance, Iglidan played the bandura, a plucked-string Ukrainian instrument, while Legend was on the piano.  Iglidan, who is from Odesa, Ukraine, shared photos leading up to her big performance on Sunday, captioning the images, "I’m sitting on the middle of this stage in front of all these famous musicians — Lady Gaga, John Legend, many, many others," she said.  She continued: "I got on stage and looked at this huge theater and barely holding my tears, started crying. I could not stop my emotions because I’m there in front of all the U.S. showing how beautiful Ukraine culture and music sounds like."

Pizza and eggs are colliding in an unexpected way on TikTok.  Creative foodies have been combining the two together long enough that the hashtag #pizzaeggs has trended enough to rack up more than 1.9 million views on the video-sharing app.  Some of the viral recipe videos on the app stick to eggs and popular pizza toppings like a traditional omelet while others involve actual leftover pizza slices and scrambled eggs.  Content creator Elyse Myers, who has the highest viewed pizza eggs video on TikTok so far, makes her recipe with butter, pre-cooked chicken, pepperoni slices, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, eggs and cheese.  'PIZZA TOAST' IS TIKTOK'S LATEST VIRAL FOOD TREND  "This was an original recipe that came from me trying to eat up all the leftovers in the fridge," Myers told Fox News Digital. "It kind of evolved over time and then we just ate it so much, we gave it the name ‘pizza eggs.’"  She added, "The taste is kind of like eating a spicy sausage, egg and cheese scramble."  While Myers isn’t the first to share a pizza-inspired egg recipe, other TikTok users have opted to fry leftover pizza and fresh-cracked eggs in a skillet.  Shay Spence, a self-proclaimed "professional eater," is one of the many leftover pizza remixers who turn to eggs to liven up the dish.  PIZZA ICE CREAM FROM VAN LEEUWEN TO LAUNCH AT WALMART EXCLUSIVELY  He first shared his pizza eggs recipe in 2020 and then again in 2022, which involves cutting up pizza slices into cubes and frying it in oil before adding optional sauce, blended eggs, salt and pepper – all cooked on medium heat.  Spence told Fox News Digital that he first learned how to make pizza eggs from his college roommate.  "I put my twist on it by really caramelizing the pizza pieces until they’re almost like croutons and the cheese gets nice and crispy," he said. "The eggs start to rehydrate the pizza also, so it’s the perfect way to use up leftovers that are going stale."  VIRAL PIZZA HACK HELPS YOU GRAB SLICE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE REST OF THE PIE  What do food experts think about pizza eggs?  Kimberly Baker, the director of the Clemson Extension Food Systems and Safety Program at Clemson University, told Fox News Digital that "eggs are a good protein source and have a mild flavor" that can "pair well with many other foods."  "Eggs cook quickly with minimal equipment and clean-up, and pizza is a dish that most Americans love and can modify the toppings to their preference," she continued. "Therefore, combining the ease of preparation, flavors that blend well with almost everyone’s taste preference, and a nutritionally dense dish makes it a recipe that many people want to try after seeing how easy they are to make on social media."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Retired pizza chef of 30 years and Pala Pizza blog writer Stefano Velia told Fox News Digital that eggs have long worked with cheese, sausage and bacon.  In his professional opinion, popular meat-based pizza toppings like pepperoni aren’t "too far of a flavor stretch."  "The most unusual combination would be eggs with pizza sauce," he went on. "However, the ever-popular North African dish Shakshouka uses spicy tomato sauce and poached eggs. All of the ingredients, in one way or another, work well together."  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS    Sylvia Fountaine, a professional chef and CEO of the recipe website Feasting at Home, told Fox News Digital that she thinks pizza-inspired egg recipes might be seeing a rise in interest due to the popular ketogenic diet.  "Keto involves consuming high fat, high protein and low-to-no carbohydrates, meaning [regular] pizza is off the menu," she said. "Eggs are high protein, and cheese, pepperoni and certain tomato sauces are considered keto compliant, so pizza eggs can be a tasty substitute if avoiding carbs."

McHugh only sang the first words of the song before switching gears and conducting the crowd as they sang the rest.  "It took me a second to process because of the tradition of everyone standing, removing their hats and listening to someone like me sing the national anthem," McHugh told the Charlotte Observer.

The Pentagon’s most recent search for extremists within the ranks was just the latest failure to find evidence that the military is a breeding ground for violent radicals, a Fox News review has found.  The Department of Defense identified fewer than 100 instances of confirmed extremist activity in 2021, the Pentagon reported in December. Despite significant rhetoric from Democrats, media pundits and activists, the finding was unsurprising to more than 30 current and former service members who spoke with Fox News.  "I noticed zero extremism during my time in the military," Matthew Griffin, a former Army Ranger, told Fox News. "None. Didn't witness it at all."  Each service member echoed similar remarks, explicitly saying they’d never seen any extremist behavior.  NAVY BARRED FROM ACTING AGAINST RELIGIOUS VACCINE REFUSERS  The service members Fox News interviewed ranged from cadet to major. They spanned five branches and the political spectrum, and their service dates as far back as 1980.  Being unable to find even 100 extremists in the military "is a success story and shows that extremism is not a large problem," a former command sergeant major said.  Many said the service would even stamp out extremism since it would harm unit cohesion – a critical component to combat effectiveness across the branches. They also told Fox News that the military serves as a sort of melting pot that exposes recruits to unfamiliar cultures and people.  "Even if you are kind of a piece of s--t, you have to be able to depend on the people with you or else you'll die or get hurt real bad," Jariko Denman, a retired Army Ranger, told Fox News. "All of the kind of ignorance that leads to extremist behavior, it's squashed because you're immersed in all these other cultures, you're immersed with all these other types of people."  Given that investigations have repeatedly failed to prove a systemic problem, many service members told Fox News that dedicating significant time to pursuing extremists would ultimately take away from combat readiness.  They also said that senior officers are aware that a widespread issue doesn’t exist, but won’t push back because they’re more concerned with falling in line to score promotions.  Still, activists and others have argued that even a few extremists with military training could create a massive risk. They frequently point to the Oklahoma City bomber, a veteran who killed more than 150 people, including children.  The Pentagon, along with its report on extremists in the military, provided updated guidance on identifying and handling extremists within the ranks.  "If someone had that kind of behavior that they exhibited and acted on or something, they would not last," one soldier who retired as a sergeant major with Special Forces after 27 years in the Army told Fox News. "There's so many checks and balances in the military that it’d really be hard to hide those kind of feelings."  Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale told Fox News in an emailed statement: "The overwhelming majority of those who serve our nation in uniform and their civilian colleagues do so with great honor and integrity, upholding our core military values and oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution."  "However, it only takes a few people to have an outsized effect on troop morale and how the military is perceived by the nation they serve," the statement continued. "We owe our people an environment that is free from prohibited extremist activities. We also owe our nation a military that reflects the founding values of our democracy."  Repeated investigations found few extremists  The Pentagon and outside investigators alike have sought to identify extremists among the ranks, but none have turned up more than a handful out of the 2.1 million active duty service members, Fox News’ review found.  After DOD reported in 2018 that just 18 service members had been disciplined or discharged for extremist activity over a five-year period, critics said the Pentagon wasn’t looking hard enough.  "They always say the numbers are small, and because of that, it is not a priority," Carter Smith, a 30-year Army criminal investigator, told The New York Times in 2019. "So every year they get a report based on what they were never looking for."  He said the military needed to establish a task force to monitor extremist networks.  US COMMANDER ON AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN EUROPE AFTER UKRAINE CONFLICT: ‘WE’RE GOING TO STILL NEED MORE'  The 2021 DOD report boasted improvements to its process for catching extremists within the ranks before indicating that it found less than 100 instances.  The report also said the number of potentially violent radicals has increased over time. But that claim is impossible to verify since the Pentagon didn’t provide an exact figure or even indicate whether it found more than it did in 2018.  Even with exhaustive investigations, there’s no evidence that more extremists in the military would be uncovered.  Frontline and ProPublica partnered on a triple-byline news investigation in 2018. The three reporters conducted dozens of interviews, combed through 250,000 confidential messages and reviewed social media and other internet posts.  All told, they identified six people with military ties in Atomwaffen, an anti-government white supremacist group. Three were employed by the Army or Navy at the time, and the other three were veterans.  Additionally, a University of Maryland team reported that from 1990 through 2021, "461 individuals with U.S. military backgrounds committed criminal acts that were motivated by their political, economic, social, or religious goals."  But it noted that 120 of those – or about one-quarter – were charged for breaching the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. The report also pointed out that those with military background made up less than 12% of the people charged with crimes related to extremism over the 31-year period.  "Scholars are generally in agreement that there is no single profile of an extremist," the report said.  Further, nearly 84% of the 461 identified were no longer in the military when they committed a criminal act of extremism, according to the University of Maryland report. Almost 40% had left the service 15 or more years before they were arrested for extremism, while just over 15% were out for two or fewer years.  Meanwhile, the head of the Pentagon’s anti-extremism working group, Bishop Garrison, said supporting former President Trump is supporting racism and extremism, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported.  High-profile white supremacists had military backgrounds  Critics have argued that even a small number of extremists with military experience could pose a significant threat.  "The numbers might be small, but they are like a drop of cyanide in your drink," Carter told The New York Times in 2019. "They can do a lot of damage."  The University of Maryland team determined that extremists with military backgrounds killed 314 people over the 31-year period. More than half were from a single event.  The notorious Oklahoma bomber, Timothy McVeigh, was a decorated Gulf War veteran who was radicalized before joining the Army.  DOD MOVES TO COUNTER ‘EXTREMISM’ IN RANKS, TOP REPUBLICAN WARNS AGAINST ‘VIRTUE SIGNALING’  About four years after he was honorably discharged, McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168, including 19 children, and injuring hundreds more.  Other high-profile extremists have also had military ties, including Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon Louis Beam, Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and White Patriot Party leader Frazier Glenn Miller.  Atomwaffen founder Brandon Russell was serving in Florida’s National Guard when he was arrested in 2017 after authorities found a stash of explosives, including the same substance McVeigh used.  Russell, who kept a framed picture of McVeigh on his dresser, according to the Department of Justice, was sentenced to five years in prison.  Meanwhile, nearly one-quarter of troops polled in a Military Times survey said they witnessed white nationalism within the ranks, though it’s unclear how that phrase was defined. Subsequent surveys by the publication reported similar findings.  Several service members told Fox News they may have witnessed racism or bigotry among rookies. But they said that was exclusively among new recruits who hailed from hometowns with little diversity and had little exposure to other groups of people.  "They're going to carry those opinions with them because it's what they know," Denman said. "Once they were in the military and they could actually see people from other cultures and backgrounds and all these things, they’re like, ‘Oh, that was dumb.’"  Advocates have also said that extremist groups actively try recruiting veterans. Guidance DOD released alongside its 2021 report called for a program to help service members avoid such recruitment as they transition out of the military.  Focusing on a non-existent problem harms combat readiness, service members say  Every service member Fox News interviewed for this story – on and off the record – said they never witnessed extremism during their time in the military.  "Over three decades in the military, I never saw this as an issue," an Army veteran who did four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan said.  Griffin added: "I think the media is definitely exacerbating this issue. They had their hypothesis that the military is full of extremists and they're willing to go down on the ship just to state so."  Denman, whose grandfathers, father and older brother were all in the military, said the charge is "absolutely not fair, and it sheds a really piss poor light on the military as a whole."  NAVY EXTENDS BOOT CAMP TO ENCOMPASS ‘EXTREMISM’ AND SEXUAL ASSAULT  "Seeing all these people of all walks of life – different races, different creeds, different sexual orientations – all this doing great things together, and then to have our government come in and say ‘the military has an extremism problem,’ it's a slap in the face," Denman continued. "It's an insult to all those people that are out there doing the right thing."  Still, Denman, as well as an active duty Navy officer said they felt it was important to ensure extremism wasn’t a problem.  "We all are better served when we have sort of a middle of the road kind of viewpoint about things," the officer said. "Anybody who's polarized is probably not healthy for our democracy."  But many service members said focusing on something they believe isn’t an issue harms combat readiness since it takes up time officers could spend preparing troops for battle.  "If we burden the military leadership with so much other issues, we are really taking away from what the military is there for. That's to defend our borders and to execute American policy," a former Special Forces sergeant, whose son is in the Army, told Fox News.  Weeks before the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine, Tyler Allcorn, a former Green Beret running for Congress in Colorado as a Republican told Fox News: "We need to spend less time on these witch hunts targeting our own soldiers and spending more time focused on strategic threats like China and Russia and any others that are threatening our country."  "If Joe Biden had put this much time into developing an exit strategy for Afghanistan than he does targeting our own soldiers … then maybe the 13 service members who lost their lives back in that country would be alive today," Allcorn added.  Breasseale, the Pentagon spokesman, said in his statement to Fox News: "While it may be the opinion of a few that one day of training is too much, the Department knows that the training was necessary and time well spent. We pride ourselves on being a military that can do many things at once."  Many service members told Fox News they believed senior leadership, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, knew extremism wasn’t a systemic issue, but were too afraid to oppose that narrative.  "I believe Austin and Milley went along whole heartedly," the former command sergeant major said, noting how Milley told Congress he wanted to understand "white rage."  Others said senior officers care more about advancing their careers. As a result, the service members said, those officers won’t press against their superiors when they see bad orders.  "There is an attempt to politicize our military to weed out officers who don't buy hook, line and sinker into this new age modernity," the four-tour Army veteran said. Senior officers "lack the moral courage to say, ‘Hey boss, that's really stupid.’"  Nickaylah Sampson, who dropped out of West Point last year, said she "met officers firsthand just who flat out told me the only way to make rank is by fulfilling the wants of the officers ahead of you no matter what it is."  A Special Operations Central deputy commander argued that this growing culture caused the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, Fox News previously reported.  "When you get in that general officer area, you don't want to rock the boat with whoever is currently in office or who you think will be in office," Denman, who stressed his hate for officers, told Fox News. The military will "never do things for the benefit of a particular political party, but I do think that a lot of the decisions are made or not made by a lot of the higher-level brass like generals with politics in mind."  Many service members also saw the hunt for extremists as politically unbalanced, disproportionately targeting the right while ignoring left-wing extremists. Last year, Austin ordered a stand-down to discuss extremism, but gave commanders discretion in how to handle it.  An active duty special operations officer told Fox News that her commander presented a slide show during the stand-down that depicted Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, Osama bin Laden and the QAnon Shaman – the shirtless, horn-bearing Capitol rioter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I immediately was like, ‘OK, this is politicized to me, because if you're going to put one end of the political spectrum up against Osama bin Laden, then why don't you put someone up against the left end of the political spectrum?’" the service member said. She suggested showing a rioter from the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations burning down a building.  The DOD’s 2021 guidance also tightened some restrictions and forbid service members from liking or sharing extremist content on social media.  "If the American government is going to go and surveil the social media accounts of over two million military patriots and heroes for extremism, then I think they should also monitor the social media accounts of Joe Biden's administration, Nancy Pelosi and probably all the Democrats in Congress," Allcorn told Fox News. "I guarantee you're going to find more than a hundred extremists in that group."  Editor's note: This story has been updated to include a statement from the Pentagon.

Ukrainian members of Parliament who flew to Washington, D.C., this week to request more assistance in the war told Fox News that women and children were dying as they spoke and that they needed more than "nice speeches."  "We can't have just statements and nice speeches," Ukrainian MP Yevheniia Kravchuk told Fox News. "We need to prove that democracy matters, that the free choice matters, that human rights matters."  WATCH NOW:  The MPs, all women, visited with lawmakers as well as with Pentagon and State Department officials and asked for more military equipment and financial assistance.  "Congress plays a crucial role in pushing government, President Biden White House, to be more faster, to be more firm, and to be more strict in assistance of Ukraine," Ukraine Parliament member Lesia Zaburanna, told Fox News.

The Parliament members met with veterans in the bipartisan For Country Caucus first among their meetings.  Veterans have played a leading role, across party lines, to do more, faster for Ukraine.  Anastasia Radina, another Ukrainian MP, echoed Zaburanna and said Biden needed to take greater action.

One Kyiv official said Thursday that Ukraine "pays a very high price every day defending the values of a democratic world."  "We need the military assistance, we need weapons, we need financial assistance," Zaburanna, a Kyiv native, said. "I don't know what I will see when I return home."  Similarly, Kravchuk said the U.S. needs "to help us with weapons because we are capable of winning."

One of the key things that Pastor Corey Brooks’ Project H.O.O.D. community center does is rehabilitate those who served time in prison. In many ways, it is far easier to rehab an ex-convict than it is to land that person a job of means. It is understandable that many businesses would be reluctant to bring such a person into their workforce — after all, these businesses often face so many challenges to stay afloat. However, there are those businesses that make an attempt to include America’s unwanted into the workforce, and when that succeeds, the larger society is all the better for it.  One of those businesses is The Bazaar, a 62-year-old wholesale distribution business based out of River Grove, a town right outside Chicago’s city limits. On the 131st day of his rooftop vigil to raise funds to build a building for his community center, the pastor invited The Bazaar’s CEO, Brad Nardick, to the roof for a chat by the campfire.  The pastor opened the conversation by asking Nardick to describe his unique hiring process.  "The way we've chosen to build our business over the past eight years is we have created hiring pathways for people who have criminal backgrounds, people with disabilities," Nardick began. "Today, about 55 of my employees, which is almost 40% of my business team, are people who have former backgrounds in gangs and in prison. [We also have] people who are in wheelchairs, people who are deaf. We are an open door."  ROOFTOP REVELATIONS: 'BUSINESS IS THE MAGIC THAT CURES SOCIAL ILLS,' PASTOR BROOKS SAYS  "I want to talk about those individuals who come out of gangs and those individuals who are returning from prison and trying to get their footing and trying to change their lives," the pastor said. "Why is it that your company has decided to be so courageous and give those individuals an opportunity?"  "There's two parts. It's personal. I grew up from privilege. And as a business owner, it's our job," Nardick said. "The purpose of the business is to help the people who are around us. So for us, it's important … to open doors to people, to reach out our hand in the community."  Nardick continued: "And then the other part, part two, which is the more important part, is that it's great for business. It's great for the people who come work for us … When you fill your building with people like that, unstoppable."  "A lot of people are going to say, no, business is all about making money. And I'm for capitalism, I'm for free markets," the pastor said. "At Project H.O.O.D., we're trying to give people skills so they can go into the marketplace, participate in free market capitalism, participate in the American dream, take care of their families, and change their lives. I want to ask you this, what challenges have you experienced trying to do this?"  "The challenges are people who don't have work history. It's kind of a chicken and the egg type of thing," Nardick said. "How do I get good if I've never had a chance to get good at working?  "Right."  "So we are patient. And the reality of running a company today is you got to be nimble. And the thing that makes a business the most nimble is trust. It's a mutual agreement that we invest in our people and they invest back in us as a business."  "Some of the guys who have been in gangs, right?" the pastor asked. "The ones who have been fully committed, what do you think about them?"  "I'm going to talk about a man by his nickname. His name is LJ," Nardick said. "LJ grew up on the streets of Chicago, spent some time in prison. We found him through an organization just like Project H.O.O.D. And for him, the opportunity to build wealth for his family, to build a life for himself, to move up in the world consistently and honestly, the attitude that guy brings to the building is unmatched."  "Wow."  "Unmatched. I had never had anybody come to my office and thank me for letting them clean gutters. Letting them do the tough work. He's a facilities manager, so that's why he does that work," Nardick said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "There's a lot of LJs," the pastor said. "That's one of the reasons why it's so important that we have these collaborations and that we find companies and that we inspire companies to do what you do. I think companies want to help, but sometimes they just don't know how. And sometimes they don't have the courage. But when they hear from individuals like yourself, it gives them the courage and it gives them the know-how, how to take this chance and go ahead and give these individuals a second chance."  "We're playing our part. We're not a multinational business. I wish I had thousands of jobs to give," Nardick smiled. "And it's as simple as that. It's what's right in front of our face. The people who are in our neighborhood, it's in our best interest for them to win. For them to have security in their lives."  "I'm so appreciative that you're giving these individuals second chances and opportunities that they would not have if it were not for your company. So shouts out to your company and all the employees."  Follow along as Fox News checks in Pastor Corey Brooks each day with a new Rooftop Revelation .

Although the economy remains in good health, the head of the nation's largest bank said that the Russian war in Ukraine could collide with sky-high inflation and an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve this year to slow growth and reshape the world for years to come.  FED RAISES INTEREST RATES FOR FIRST TIME IN 3 YEARS, PROJECTS 6 MORE HIKES AS INFLATION SURGES  "They present completely different circumstances than what we’ve experienced in the past—and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead," Dimon said. "While it is possible, and hopeful, that all of these events will have peaceful resolutions, we should prepare for the potential negative outcomes."  The outlook has shifted considerably since Dimon wrote the closely watched letter to shareholders last year in which he said an economic "Goldilocks moment" could last until 2023. At the time, the economy was on the upswing as vaccination rates increased, more Americans ventured out to shop, eat at restaurants and travel and the government approved another influx of federal relief money.  But since then, American consumers have confronted the fastest inflation spike since 1982 as the price of everyday goods including food, gasoline and cars surges higher.  "In hindsight, the medicine…was probably too much and lasted too long," Dimon wrote, referring to the trillions in pandemic-era stimulus measures that padded consumers' wallets and helped to keep businesses afloat.  The outbreak of the worst European conflict in decades has also roiled markets and threatened to push inflation even higher – in addition to creating a massive humanitarian crisis that has left more than 13,000 dead and millions displaced.  "Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation," Dimon said.  Dimon said that he is not concerned about JPMorgan's direct exposure to Moscow – though he disclosed the company stands to lose about $1 billion "over time" from its businesses in Russia.  Finally, the chief executive said that the Federal Reserve poses a risk to the economy, saying the central bank could move interest rates "significantly higher than the markets expect."  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  Fed policymakers began raising rates last month and have penciled in six, similarly sized increases this year. But officials have since suggested they could move more aggressively to tighten policy amid concerns the Fed waited too long to confront sky-high inflation.  "This process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets," Dimon added.

Suarez made the comment as he revealed the formula for his city’s success as a technology hub ahead of the world’s largest Bitcoin conference that is being held in Miami starting on Wednesday.  Ticker Security Last Change Change % COIN COINBASE GLOBAL INC. 191.67 +4.71 +2.52% CME CME GROUP INC. 239.82 +1.96 +0.82%  Bitcoin started the week trading down around $46,000, after gaining over the weekend ahead of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami this week, which Suarez noted is "the largest crypto conference in the world."  "We are going to have 50,000 attendees and it’s going to be an economic development boom for our city, creating thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in economic incentives for our city," the Miami mayor told host Maria Bartiromo.  When Bartiromo asked Suarez why crypto has been important in terms of instituting it as part of the Miami economy, he responded by noting that "it’s part of our transitional brand from a city that was a great place to visit, a great place to retire, to what [the] Financial Times called "the most important city in America."  CLICK HERE FOR FOX BUSINESS' REAL-TIME CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICING DATA  He noted that Miami was able to achieve that title "by keeping true to three simple rules," which includes keeping taxes as low as possible and increasing funding for the police.  Suarez noted that prioritizing safety has led to a reduction in homicides "last year by 23% and this year by close to 40%."  He stressed that "leaning into innovation" is the third way Miami was able to put itself on the map as an important city.  "Crypto is one of the ways that we have completely leaned into innovation to take away this concept that there are other cities in America that are the technological hubs of our country," Suarez told Bartiromo.

President Biden's blame game for rising gas prices recently shifted to Russian President Vladimir Putin and American oil companies, but the owners of one family-operated oil company in Texas argue the blame falls on Biden himself.  "Fox & Friends Weekend" co-host Will Cain set out to explore the crux of America's energy industry by getting the inside scoop from Discovery Operating, an independently-owned oil company supplying energy to the U.S. from over 300 wells across Texas.  "We're producing over 500 million barrels [of oil] a day from the Permian Basin … and it's being led by the independent oil producer," said CEO Jeff Sparks.  CNN GUEST WARNS TAPPING INTO OIL RESERVES WON'T HELP US GAS PRICES: ‘IF WE DON’T REFILL ‘WE’RE IN TROUBLE'  "If we're setting records in production, why are gasoline prices so high?" Cain asked.  "We have an administration that really is anti-fossil fuels," Sparks responded.  "If I can drill and get the oil out of the ground, and I don't have anywhere to send it because there's not enough capacity on a pipeline to send it to a refinery, what do I do with it? It sits in a tank and everything gets shut in," he added.  But, as Cain said, drilling is just the first step. Canary, a company providing drilling and production services, is another.  "Right now, I hear from everybody we are producing at record numbers. We could be producing more. Can we be [energy] independent right here in America?" Cain asked Canary CEO Dan Eberhart.  "We were energy independent under the Trump administration, and we can be again." Eberhart answered.

With less than a month to go until primary day in Ohio, one of the leading candidates in the competitive and contentious Republican Senate race landed a major endorsement.  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on Monday endorsed Josh Mandel, a U.S. Marine combat veteran and former Ohio treasurer who’s making his third bid for the Senate.  THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN OHIO'S CROWDED AND COMPETITIVE GOP SENATE PRIMARY  "As our nation faces crisis after crisis under Joe Biden, our country needs Conservative fighters to stand up to the radical Democrats who want to exploit these problems to deliver socialism to America. That's why I am supporting Josh Mandel for U.S. Senate," Cruz, who remains popular with many on the right across the country, wrote in a statement.  Pointing to Mandel’s two tours of duty in the war in Iraq, Cruz emphasized that "Josh is a proven fighter for our American way of life, a champion for the unborn, and a stalwart advocate for our religious liberties. I am proud to endorse Josh Mandel for U.S. Senate, and I ask every conservative in Ohio to do the same."  Cruz becomes the third Republican in the Senate to support Mandel, following Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.  "Having Senator Cruz's support shows that he believes I am the only candidate in this U.S. Senate race who will have the backbone and courage to stand up alongside him in Washington and take on the party bosses, left-wing media, and powerful lobbyists," Mandel wrote in a statement. "When I get to the Senate, I look forward to serving as a reinforcement for Senator Cruz as we stand up to Joe Biden and work to defeat the far-left's radical agenda."  FRONT-RUNNERS GIBBONS AND MANDEL TAKE AIM AT EACH OTHER  Mandel is one of eight GOP candidates running in the race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. The crowded and heated primary field also includes 2018 Ohio Republican Senate candidate Mike Gibbons, a Cleveland entrepreneur, real estate developer and investment banker; venture capitalist and bestselling author J.D. Vance; former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken; and state Sen. Matt Dolan, a former county and state prosecutor whose family owns Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Guardians.  Gibbons has been endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who, like Cruz, is also influential with many conservatives across the country. Vance has been backed by Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, another conservative firebrand.  Timken was endorsed earlier this year by Portman. She also has the backing of Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of neighboring West Virginia, Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.

The United Nations on Monday confirmed over 3,500 people killed or wounded since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  That number is likely just the tip of the iceberg as the group has been unable to gain access to areas of heavy fighting.  The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) officially confirmed that 1,430 civilians had been killed and 2,097 injured since the Russian invasion began, with 121 children among the dead.

The leader of the British secret intelligence agency, MI6, said Sunday that "we knew" that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion plans for Ukraine included "summary executions."  The shocking assertion appears to tie Putin directly to what Western countries have decried as war crimes coming to light in the suburbs of Kyiv as Russian troops have pulled back in recent days.  Ukrainian officials and at least the leaders of Poland and Spain have gone a step further to say Russians committed genocide during what's been deemed the Bucha massacre, as shocking images have surfaced of civilians with their hands tied behind their backs shot and killed at close range and bodies of women and children showing signs of rape and torture.  BUCHA MASSACRE: GLOBAL OUTCRY AGAINST RUSSIA ESCALATES AS HORRIFYING STORIES EMERGE OF UKRAINE ATROCITIES  "We knew Putin’s invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services," Chief of MI6 Richard Moore tweeted on Sunday. "The reports of execution-style killings of civilians emerging from liberated areas are horrifying and chilling."  Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in towns around the capital, Kyiv. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists said they witnessed 21 bodies. One group of nine, all in civilian clothes, were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been shot at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs.  In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, AP journalists also said they saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into a pit. Residents said the mayor, her son, and her husband — who had been bound and blindfolded — were among them.  GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING:  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  "Concentrated evil has come to our land," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Sunday, referencing the dead bodies strewn in the streets of Bucha. "Murderers, torturers, rapists, looters, who call themselves the army and who deserve only death after what they did."  "I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed?" Zelenskyy said. "Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death?  "This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image," he added. "Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women."  Moore responded to a tweet by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss condemning the "appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha" and calling for such "indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia’s illegal and unjustified invasion" be investigated as war crimes.

Despite normally erring on the side of secrecy, top-ranking intelligence officials in the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries have been more outspoken about the war in Ukraine as part of an effort to counteract what they categorize as Russian misinformation seeking to displace blame for Putin’s invasion.  Last week, Sir Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, the UK's Intelligence, Cyber and Security Agency, described Putin’s "personal war" in Ukraine as a "strategic miscalculation." "Even though we believe Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what's going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime," he told an audience in Australia, according to Business Insider.  Truss said the United Kingdom will fully support any investigations by the International Criminal Court, in its role as the primary institution with the mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes. The UK-led effort to expedite and support an International Criminal Court investigation into crimes in Ukraine was the largest State referral in its history, according to the foreign secretary.

Former Miss Connecticut arrived back from her trip in Poland along the Ukraine border after helping facilitate the safe passage of Ukrainian refugees.  Olga Litvinenko, who competed in the 2017 Miss USA Pageant, was born in Ukraine and lived there as a child. She recently worked to get family members safely out of the war-torn country.  The dual citizen told Fox News Digital some family members initially didn't want to leave their home country because "they’ve been there all their lives. For them, it's their home, and everything."  U.S. 'NOT DOING ENOUGH' TO SUPPORT UKRAINE: FMR. GOV. GEORGE PATAKI  After she heard explosions in the background during a phone call with a family member, she said the decision became clear.  Litvinenko shared that most of her family members were safe to a "certain extent" aside from the men.  A temporary restriction had been imposed in Ukraine blocking any men between the ages of 18-60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.  Beyond assisting her family members, Olga has launched an organization to support the safe passage of Ukrainian refugees.  USA for Ukraine has been working to fundraise $250,000 towards medical supplies, gear and supplies for the troops fighting, direct aid to the refugee families and to volunteers.  While overseas, she worked with the group to facilitate about 90 refugees, bringing them over to France with a sponsored double-decker bus.  GRAMMYS 2022 SEES UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY MAKE A VIRTUAL APPEARANCE: 'FILL THE SILENCE WITH YOUR MUSIC’  She said USA for Ukraine worked to get the refugees "placed in proper homes with host families that help them with food, with expenses for their first few days until they were able to get the temporary stay."  Litvinenko added that it is a priority to make sure the refugees are treated very well sharing, when entering France "we even got some their first croissants."  The group is also assisting a Ukrainian animal shelter that has roughly 3,000 animals, two of which her mom brought with her to Connecticut from Ukraine.

With the war in Ukraine raging on, the country is in critical need of medical supplies. One nonprofit in the U.S. is trying to fill that void.  Project C.U.R.E. has 30,000 volunteers for its seven locations nationwide. It's been working nonstop since Russia invaded Ukraine. All equipment or supplies in the distribution centers are donations, but the journey to get these supplies to the war zone certainly isn’t easy.  Volunteers have been hard at work at the Project C.U.R.E. international headquarters and distribution center in Centennial, Colorado. Lyn Tison has been a volunteer with the organization for a year and says things have gotten much busier since Russia invaded Ukraine.  "Every little bit counts, and even though I’m not there, I still feel like I'm helping a lot," said Tison.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: LIVE UPDATES HERE  As for the logistics and shipping of medical supplies to Ukrainians in need, the timing of the war couldn’t be worse.  "Right now, it’s difficult to get an airplane or container to go anywhere anyway, and we have been postponed two or three months on the loads that we’re doing. And now there is a crisis, and we need to get going on shipping," said Douglas Jackson, Project C.U.R.E.’s president and CEO.  Once medical supplies do leave Colorado or any one of the seven Project C.U.R.E. branches scattered across the country, they have a long journey to eventually get to Ukraine.  ZELENSKYY SEEKING VOLUNTEERS, CALLS FOR ‘INTERNATIONAL’ TEAM TO FIGHT RUSSIA  From the Colorado distribution center, the supplies will travel to Chicago by truck, Chicago to Toronto by truck, Toronto to Warsaw by plane and Warsaw into Ukraine by truck.  Project C.U.R.E. partnered with Ukrainians of Colorado. Volunteer Andrij Lenec’s parents were Ukrainian immigrants, and he served in the Peace Corps in Ukraine after he retired. Lenec said when Russia invaded Ukraine, he was stunned.  "That first day, I was just in a state of shock. Knowing that people that I know, and love, and lived with, and ate with and conversed with were in danger," Lenec said.  Ukrainians of Colorado is helping coordinate requests for specific trauma and medical supplies directly from Ukraine.

Pavlo Kozenko is a Ukrainian doctor in Truskavets, a town near the city of Lviv in Western Ukraine.  "We are really thankful to the United States and other Western countries for the great support we’ve already received," said Kozenko.  AMERICANS DONATE BODY ARMOR, AMMUNITION FOR UKRAINE  Kozenko says the main equipment needed includes tourniquets to stop major bleeding, which he says is the No. 1 preventable cause of death.  "Priority No. 1 is the treatment of our soldiers and saving their lives, but also we appreciate any kind of medical, relevant medical equipment or relevant drugs which come to Ukraine," said Kozenko.  Project C.U.R.E. is giving all that it can right now, but once the supplies get close to Ukraine, things could change at a moment’s notice.

"So, what was a safe passage yesterday may not be a safe passage tomorrow and that’s part of the trick with this one."  Once medical supplies do make it to Europe, Jackson said, Project C.U.R.E. will work with organizations to move it by truck into Ukraine. Jackson says it’s going to all come down to trust.

Three premature babies have been safely transported from Ukraine to Poland as the Russia-Ukraine war continues.  Project DYNAMO, an American civilian and ally rescue nonprofit based in Tampa, launched a mission that successfully evacuated twin baby boys and one baby girl from Kyiv on Monday, March 7.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The rescue mission, which the organization is calling "GEMINI," was accomplished with help from two doctors, two neonatal specialists, one nurse and a Ukrainian ambulance crew — and comes 11 days after Russia launched its attack on Ukraine.  Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv remains an active war zone as Russian forces continue shelling. Many families have evacuated the city and country as a result.  HALF A MILLION CHILDREN BECOME REFUGEES AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR DESTROYS HOMES AND SERVICES  In a press release, Project DYNAMO wrote that rescue volunteers report that they heard shelling "within earshot of the hospital" during their departure.  "During operational planning and execution, I was anxious because premature babies, under the best of circumstances in the best hospitals, are fragile and vulnerable," Project DYNAMO Co-founder Bryan Stern told Fox News Digital. "When we put them in a war zone surrounded by Russian artillery and troops, that presents a complicated medical situation and makes it much scarier."  "From an evacuation perspective, having to move these fragile babies through these war zones by vehicle, is wrought with peril and danger. I'm overcome with joy and happiness to be able to help the family by delivering Lenny and Moishe," Stern continued. "The Project DYNAMO team, in concert with others, all worked together to deliver these bundles of joy to two happy families. Once the operation was complete, with happy parents, I felt like a delivery room doctor introducing children to their parents for the very first time.  The babies that Project DYNAMO evacuated were transported in incubators via ambulance, which received an escort made up of the nonprofit’s volunteers.  Project DYNAMO describes its team members as "humanitarians" and says many of them are "current and former members of the U.S. military" who have experience in "special operations and intelligence communities."  FOREIGNERS WHO FLED UKRAINE AMID WAR WITH RUSSIA NOW HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME  The rescue vans traveled more than 700 miles west from Kyiv to Hospital PRO-FAMILIA in Rzeszow, Poland, where the American twin boys and the British baby girl were reunited with their families and respective national consular service providers.  Project DYNAMO reports that the GEMINI mission also led to the safe evacuation of two Ukrainian women and a British couple.  So far, the organization reports that 150 civilians have been rescued in 14 missions.  UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'  The nonprofit has received more than 14,000 evacuation requests from people around the world in relation to the Russia-Ukraine war, including the U.S., U.K, Canada, France, Romania, Nigeria, Mexico and Afghanistan.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  Evacuation requests have also come from "citizens and residents from other European nations," Project DYNAMO wrote in its release, "many of whom include children and the elderly and members of the Jewish community in Ukraine."  Updated evacuation numbers from the United Nations state that more than two million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its attack on the country on Feb. 24, 2022.  The intergovernmental agency estimates that these evacuation numbers could potentially double.  KYIV ZOO STAFF, FAMILIES HIDE AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IN 'ZOO MILITARY COMMUNE'  A Monday press release from UNICEF says "hundreds of thousands" of Ukraine evacuees are children and many of them "are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members."  As the fight between Russia and Ukraine shows no sign of slowing at this time, Project DYNAMO reports that it will continue evacuation operations.  It recommends that people in need of help submit Ukraine evacuation requests on projectdynamo.org and through the U.S. State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

Prayer vigils and rallies for peace are being held by concerned citizens in the U.S. and around the globe as Ukraine battles the Russian invasion.  Youth groups and schools throughout the country are doing their part to send well wishes to the people directly impacted by the war and protest the clashes that were started by the Russian Armed Forces on Thursday, Feb. 24.  Anna Cirilli, the principal of the St. Nicholas Cathedral School in Chicago told Fox News Digital that students have been organizing prayer vigils to show support for family members and friends who are still in Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The students and staff continue to pray for peace for Ukraine," Cirilli said.  In a written vigil excerpt from Monday, Feb. 28, which was provided to Fox News Digital, the St. Nicholas Cathedral School prayed for the safety and protection of all those affected by the war.  "There are people that are protecting their land by fighting in the armed services, volunteer battalions, and militias. These people are heroes, they are the pride of the country for putting their lives on the line for the safety of Ukraine and for all of Europe," St. Nicholas Cathedral School vigil participants said during their prayer. "There are innocent civilians that are paying the price of a war that they did not want. Too many people have become refugees, while others remain in hiding."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  The prayer vigil participants continued their invocation by noting that families are being separated and are unsure of when they’ll be able to see each other again.  "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not new, but Ukraine is its own independent country with its own history, beliefs, culture, language, and traditions," vigil participants said.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  The Ukrainian American Youth Association – an American branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM), a patriotic and faith-based nonprofit scouting organization – has been spreading awareness about prayer vigils and peaceful protests throughout the country.  Two days before Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv, the Ukrainian American Youth Association had urged its members to contact the White House to honor the Budapest Memorandum and put sanctions on Russia on Facebook. The organization’s call to "help Ukraine" came about after weeks of tension grew between the two countries as Russia built up its military near Ukraine’s borders.  The organization’s Ohio youth chapter CYM Cleveland was one of the first to hold a "Cleveland Pray for Ukraine" event before Russia’s attack, according to a news post from the Ukrainian Youth Association website.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  Several other chapters have gone on to host prayer vigils, including the organization’s Illinois chapter CYM (AUYA) Palatine, which held an initial church service on Thursday, where members prayed for families in Ukraine at the Immaculate Conception Church.  Fox News Digital reached out to the Ukrainian American Youth Association for comment.

Ukraine won phase one by stopping Russia from encircling Kyiv. With both sides regrouping as Russia bombs cities, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin all face big choices.  First, Zelenskyy: Should the Ukrainian president counterattack or give up territory to get a cease-fire? Zelenskyy said the war is at a "turning point" in a March 30 video. He needs more equipment to wage multiple fights to push Russia back. Right now, Ukraine is counterattacking several sites, including Kherson, which Russia took March 2. The big dilemma is Mariupol. If Ukraine can stall Russia there, Zelenskyy would score another major victory.  Zelenskyy has said since 2019 that he won’t give up territory to Russia. His choices depend on whether Ukraine’s people can hold on as ground forces fight back. "I don’t believe in any negotiation with Russia, ever," Sgt. Anton Kolumbet of Ukraine’s army told the Washington Post on Thursday. "The only language that Russia understands is the language of force."  WITHOUT RONALD REAGAN, THERE WOULD BE NO VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY  Adding to that resolve, on the ground the military forecast for Ukraine is not bad. NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said March 29 that Ukraine’s forces learn fast and can "inflict more stalling" on Russia. He and Gen, Jacqueline von Ovost, head of U.S. Transportation Command, told Congress the Ukraine supply routes have not been hit so far, Russia hasn’t disrupted Ukraine’s command and control of its forces, and even Russia’s best tanks have "chinks in their armor" when Ukraine employs the right tactics.  It’s a shame Biden and NATO still have no clear strategy to help Ukraine win. On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. wants Ukraine to win. Biden has yet to declare that policy.  Face it, the White House has been in reaction mode all along. Advisers like Gen. Mark Milley said in February that Kyiv could fall in five days. That’s why Team Biden evacuated the U.S. embassy and infamously offered Zelenskyy a ride out of his own country.  Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war.  Team Biden’s plan was to stick with sanctions and the campaign of canny, anti-Russia intelligence leaks on false flags, the plan to catch Zelenskyy, protest letters to Putin, and this week’s entries, the claims that Russian soldiers are sabotaging their own weapons while defense officials aren’t telling Putin he’s losing the war.  All that’s fine, but it’s kept Team Biden from intensifying military assistance to help Ukraine win the war. That means improved air defenses, faster munitions delivery, and probably some tactical coaching and surveillance help, too.  Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war. Remember Biden is all emotions and no statesmanship.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Then there is Putin. His plan to topple Zelenskyy and break up Ukraine into puppet "People’s Republics" failed. Unfortunately, Putin still has over 150,000 forces in Ukraine and several vicious options to continue the war.  Russia can bomb Ukraine’s cities for a long time to pressure Zelenskyy. The Pentagon says they have the "vast majority" of their bomb and missile inventory still intact. Already Russia is flying 300 sorties per day against Ukraine, up 50% from two weeks ago.  Of course, Putin could escalate with terror weapons. But I think that from a military perspective, the risks of Russian escalation are going down, not up. NATO has more forces ready to react if Russia strikes west. As Russia moves the fight east, Putin can’t easily use nuclear weapons there; the radiation will blow back into Russia. Crude chemical weapons, such as the barrel-bomb attacks seen in Syria, won’t yield tactical results.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Watch for Russia to ramp up the ground war. Russian spokesmen said they will focus on the Donbas. Russia may still be hampered by the stodgy command and control that slowed its Kyiv advance but fighting near its own borders could reduce logistics problems. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group will join other Russian reinforcements. Don’t forget there are actual trenches in parts of the Donbass.  The best way to bring peace is through Ukraine’s defeat of Russia on the battlefield. It can’t be done without more of America’s help.

A restaurateur from Utah has taken time off, so he can deliver handmade cards to Ukrainian children who have fled the war.  Dirk Astle, a Salt Lake City franchise owner of The Melting Pot – a fondue restaurant chain, felt moved to help with humanitarian relief efforts after he saw members of his church journey to the Poland-Ukraine border and all the good work they’re doing to provide aid to refugees.  "I thought I could do this, [too]," Astle wrote to Fox News Digital in an email. "I have frequent flyer miles. I have time in my schedule right now. I should go help."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  He continued, "I could not shake it from my mind. I told a few people and one good friend gave me the advice to always follow the impressions you cannot shake."  A week later, Astle booked a flight to Poland and reached out to his friend Jonathan Freedman, who is the honorary consul for Utah's Honorary Consulate of Ukraine.  Astle said he offered to transport items for Freedman during his week-long trip, and that’s when he learned that Utah’s First Lady Abby Cox launched a letter drive to share words of encouragement with Ukrainian children who have left their lives behind.  "The drawing room table at the governor’s mansion was completely flooded with letters," Astle told Fox News Digital. "I consolidated my gear into a carry-on and checked in two 50-pound bags of letters as my travel luggage. This all happened the day before I left."  In the bags were colorful cards and drawings that appear to be handcrafted by artistic children. Some were decorated with illustrations of the Ukrainian flag to signify solidarity with the country.  Astle flew to Vienna and then Kraków, a southern Polish city that’s near the border of the Czech Republic. He arrived in the country on Thursday, March 24.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  One of the bags Astle checked for his flight reportedly got misplaced in Paris, but it was luckily recovered and reunited with him three days later.  "It was actually a blessing because I didn’t have to haul both of them through the airport or through customs," Astle said.  With both bags finally in his custody, Astle then traveled about 167 miles east of his hotel to deliver the letters and other essential relief goods to refugees at the Poland-Ukraine border.  NJ WOMAN, A 'PROUD' UKRAINIAN, SELLS VARSITY SWEATER JACKETS TO SUPPORT HOME COUNTRY AMID WAR  At the border, Astle connected with United Sikhs – a global humanitarian charity that’s affiliated with the United Nations Department of Public Information.  "The group United Sikhs runs a tent immediately across the border into Poland," Astle wrote. "They are the group authorized to care for children as they come across. So, there is a large section with cots and playthings and warm food. When I told their leader about the first lady’s initiative and the letters I brought [they were] ecstatic."  Astle hand-delivered several letters to families who are sheltering at the camp.  "The children either clutched them in their hands the whole time or they very carefully stored the picture in their plastic envelope where their crucial travel documents are kept," Astle recalled. "It’s amazing."  UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'  United Sikhs plans to set up a reception table where children at the camp can "pick up a letter from a friend," Astle told Fox News Digital.  Astle said he joined the church colleagues who inspired his humanitarian trip – Allee and Lance Foster – and he’s helping them with an on-the-ground shuttle service for refugees.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Lance runs the coordination efforts for the drivers here," Astle wrote. "The Foster kids are amazing. They’re fully committed to helping the Ukrainians."  Astle is going a step further and has donated to the Fosters' "REACH: Ukraine" GoFundMe campaign, which is aiming to cover the cost of suitcases, transportation, shelter and showers, so refugees can have an easier time transitioning to their new lives outside Ukraine.

Bob Barnes, who has been cycling to all 50 state capitals in the span of a year, said he reached a "pivotal" place in his cross-country trip when he arrived in Florida.  While Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, New York, was only in Florida for a few days, his brief visit to the state marked the end of his second "switchback" of the United States and the beginning of his final leg of the journey.  But he still has plenty of land to cover.  "I want to show people that, no matter what, you can do anything you want."  Barnes arrived in the state of Florida on March 15. He visited Tallahassee, his 31st capital, and was on his way again by March 17.  He’s more than 60% done with his American adventure and shared with Fox News Digital his journey through the Sunshine State — noting that he's also shed some pounds along the way.  ‘Weather's turning, terrain is getting better'  Barnes said that after completing his second of three "switchbacks" across the U.S., he felt "great."  NEW YORK MAN BICYCLING TO ALL 50 STATES MEETS LONG-LOST HALF-SISTER IN LOUISIANA: ‘CAN’T MAKE THIS STUFF UP’  "I’m really happy," he said. "The weather’s turning. The terrain is getting better, but we’ve still got some mountains to go over."  "The other thing is, I’ve actually pedaled across the Northern United States before, so I should have a feel for it," Barnes added. "We’re going to be a little bit more south than we did before, but I can feel the end of the trip."  Completing his second switchback isn’t the only milestone for Barnes. He said he's also looking forward to reaching 10,000 miles on his trip — something he had "no idea" would fall so close to his arrival in Florida.  "Honestly, I feel a little sad, because the trip’s going to be over one day."  "Just like Mardi Gras, I couldn’t have planned that day any better," Barnes said. "Everything’s hit or miss, so I’m very surprised … It is a pivotal point in the trip."  "I can see the finish line in my head," he added.  Although he said it’s "exciting to reach these goals," he’s also going to miss the journey.  "Honestly, I feel a little sad, because the trip’s going to be over one day," Barnes said. "And I’m going to miss the trip."  MAN BIKING ACROSS US REVEALS FAVORITE STATE SO FAR  "I just love being out here," he added. "Every day is a new day. It’s incredible."  ‘We got along well’  During his visit to Florida, Barnes was able to meet up with "a friend of a friend of a friend," a man named Delbert who bought him dinner and let him stay in a house he owned that no one else was staying in at the time.  "He said I made a personal impact on him, more than I know."  "It just worked out," Barnes said. "He was a really nice guy and we got along well."  Delbert, a veteran, is also a cyclist and "a good dude," Barnes said.  "One thing that he told me that I really appreciated — he was like, ‘You don’t even know how much of an impact you have on some people,’" Barnes recalled. "He said I made a personal impact on him, more than I know."  NEW YORK MAN BICYCLING TO ALL 50 STATES REACHES OKLAHOMA, REALIZES, ‘I’M STARTING TO FEEL PROUD AGAIN’  Barnes told Fox News Digital that he feels "great" knowing that he’s inspiring people.  "I know I’ll look back and realize it more, but that’s the whole idea. I want to show people that, no matter what, you can do anything you want," Barnes said.  Barnes has also noticed a personal change. He said he’s lost 30 pounds since he started his journey in August 2021.  "All you have to do is pedal 8 hours a day, and you will lose weight," Barnes joked. "It’s pretty simple."  Barnes had told Fox News Digital earlier that throughout his journey, his diet mostly consisted of peanut butter sandwiches and fast food. He's also had some Facebook followers make him food and take him out to dinner along the way. He said he hasn't done anything specific to lose weight other than spend most of each day on his bicycle.  ‘Full of history’: The old Tallahassee capitol  Barnes’ goal is to visit each state capital and move on, so he didn’t explore much of Florida aside from parts of the Panhandle for a couple of days on his way to Tallahassee and back to Georgia.  In Tallahassee, Barnes favored the old capitol building over the new.  "It’s this big, huge, old museum, which is cool," Barnes said. "[It’s] just got a better feel to it and it’s got the [creaky] floors, and it’s just full of history."  "The new one’s all business," he added.  "I’m not going to push it and put myself in danger just to put a few more miles in."  As always, Barnes had his celebratory beer after reaching Tallahassee and soon went to meet Delbert for dinner.  FORMER UBER DRIVER BIKES TO ALL 50 STATE CAPITALS IN 1 YEAR  "I’m a little disappointed in myself because I got to the capitol and I had all these big expectations of exploring the colleges and things like that," Barnes said. "I didn’t do a thing. I was tired and just relaxed."  The areas of Florida that Barnes rode through were "warm for the most part," aside from a day of wet weather.  "Tuesday was unpleasant," he said, adding how the rest of the week improved. "It was just cold and rain … It was a soaker."

"You can basically get around anywhere you want in Tallahassee on a bicycle," he added.  Looking back, looking forward  Barnes said he hopes to be in Juneau, Alaska, by the end of July, so he can complete the journey within one year. He began his mega-trip on August 1, 2021.  "I need to make up some miles and I think I can, but … I try to be realistic," he said. "I’m not going to push it and put myself in danger just to put a few more miles in."  "I didn't expect to be in three snowstorms. I didn't expect to be in the wind for [so] long."  Looking back, Barnes said he "didn’t realize" his second switchback, across the middle of the U.S., was going to be so tough.  "That was very challenging," he said. "I didn’t expect to be in three snowstorms. I didn’t expect to be in the wind for that long of a time. I didn’t expect hills."  "Looking forward to the third [leg of the trip], I have preconceived notions and I just hope those are the things that do happen," Barnes added.

He anticipates the Rocky Mountains won’t be "as hard to go over" as the middle of the country.  "And then the Midwest — I’ve actually pedaled through Columbus and Indianapolis and Michigan four years ago, so those are all things in my head that feel good," Barnes said.  Next stop: Peach State  Until then, Barnes was looking to his 10,000th mile and reaching his 32nd capital, Atlanta, Georgia.  Barnes plans on taking a celebratory photo when he arrived at 10,000 miles.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  "That picture is going to mean something," Barnes said.

Tuesday is National Vietnam War Veterans Day, a day when Americans thank and honor all those who served in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War.  The relatively new military holiday was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, five years after President Barack Obama proclaimed the holiday in 2012, according to White House press release archives.  In his proclamation, Obama explained why it is important to create and recognize National Vietnam War Veterans Day.  VIETNAM VETERAN RECOGNIZED FOR HIS SERVICE 50 YEARS LATER  He wrote that the Vietnam War is "a story of patriots who braved the line of fire, who cast themselves into harm's way to save a friend, who fought hour after hour, day after day to preserve the liberties we hold dear."  "Yet, in one of the war's most profound tragedies, many of these men and women came home to be shunned or neglected — to face treatment unbefitting their courage and a welcome unworthy of their example," the proclamation continued later.  "We must never let this happen again."  AMERICAN VETERANS, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TRAIN UKRAINIANS IN COMBAT CARE  The proclamation went on to explain that National Vietnam War Veterans Day is a way to "reaffirm one of our most fundamental obligations: to show all who have worn the uniform of the United States the respect and dignity they deserve, and to honor their sacrifice by serving them as well as they served us."  March 29 was chosen as the day to honor Vietnam War veterans because on March 29, 1973, the last of America’s troops left Vietnam and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam was disestablished, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.  FLORIDA-BASED VETERANS GROUP HELPS UKRAINE EVACUATIONS AMID RUSSIA WAR  The U.S. military was involved in Vietnam starting in the mid-'50s. The last American personnel were evacuated from Vietnam in April 1975, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.  During the Vietnam War, more than 58,000 Americans were killed and "many thousands more" were wounded, injured or determined missing, according to the Department of Defense.  VIETNAM VET WANTS OTHER TO KNOW: YOU ARE NOT ALONE  Today, National Vietnam War Veterans Day honors everyone who served on active duty in the U.S. military from Nov. 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, the Vietnam War Commemoration says on its website.  In all, more than 9 million Americans served, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs blog post.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We make no distinction between veterans who served in-country, in-theater, or who were stationed elsewhere during the Vietnam War period," the Commemoration website explains. "All were called to serve and none could self-determine where they would serve."  Today, there are believed to be more than 6 million living Vietnam War veterans living in the U.S. and abroad, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  One of the best ways that people can commemorate National Vietnam War Veterans Day is to thank the Vietnam War veterans in their life.  NationalToday.com recommends talking with family members who may have been involved either in the military or at home during the war, as long as they feel comfortable talking about it.  The website also suggests donating money to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.

Conservative activist Scott Presler is traveling the nation to urge Americans who are sick of "failed Democrat policies" and rising gas prices to register to vote as Republicans while cleaning up the streets of trash-infested cities along the way.  "A major reason why I’m conservative and why this issue is so important to me is… our government is taking care of foreign nationals over the American people and my heart is with 50,000 homeless veterans. My heart is with 500,000 homeless Americans," Presler told Fox News Digital.  He began his journey in the summer of 2019 when then-President Trump famously criticized Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess" that "no human being" would choose to live in. The remarks hit home with Presler, the son of a retired Navy captain, who first decided to get involved with Republican activism when he became upset while watching Barack Obama get reelected in 2012.  MICHELE TAFOYA DISHES ON PIVOT FROM NFL SIDELINE TO POLITICS, ‘THE VIEW,’ AND WHAT SHE’S WILLING TO FIGHT FOR  "They inspired me to take action because everyone was tweeting, they were posting content about the trash in Baltimore, but nobody was doing anything and I thought to myself, ‘OK, if not me then who?’ So I tweeted out to my followers and said, ‘I’m going to Baltimore,’" Presler said. "The tweet went viral."  The Northern Virginia-based Presler was initially concerned that he committed to more than he could handle, but fellow conservatives quickly stepped up and offered to help. He didn’t know a thing about organizing a major cleanup effort, but figured it out along the way, ordering dumpsters, browsing Home Depot for inspiration and even renting a Porta Potty.  "Within six days we organized 200 volunteers, on a Monday, a workday, and we picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours on the most dangerous streets of America in West Baltimore," he said.  The 6-foot-5 inch Presler, known for his signature Fabio-like locks, then decided he could achieve similar success in other cities despite being a private citizen with limited resources who doesn’t have the backing of the government.  "We went to Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Dukane, Detroit, Houston, Kenosha, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Portland, Pittsburgh, Philly, and I was even protested for picking up trash in San Francisco, California," Presler said.  While it may seem like Presler is some sort of jet-setting mogul who travels around the nation, he actually relies on the kindness of like-minded people who care about America.  "The way that I’m able to do this, is if people want to donate, they may, but I have never once asked for donation. I’m very proud of that," he said. "People open their homes to me, like literally. I’m sleeping on couches, I’ve slept in RVs, I’ve slept in bunkbeds, I cuddle with people’s animals at their homes, and so it’s been the generosity of the American people opening their hearts and homes to me."  SPRING BREAKERS LET LOOSE AMID NATIONWIDE CRIME SPIKE, CURFEW ENACTED IN ONE POPULAR DESTINATION  Presler, who has nearly one million Twitter followers, didn’t even let coronavirus stop his mission, despite having to pause for a few months in 2020 when travel was difficult during the early months of the pandemic.  "My first cleanup after COVID was in Decatur, Georgia after the state of Georgia opened up and since then I have not stopped," Presler said.  While a global pandemic didn’t halt Presler’s mission, he feels "failed policies" from Democratic lawmakers made it much more difficult.  "I think, in the last two years we’ve seen crime, we’ve seen the homeless epidemic continue to rise, in part even under President Trump, but it was because of the regressive Democrat policies of ‘defund the police,’" he said. "What is the fruit of those failed policies? We’re seeing violent crime going up, we’re seeing homeless encampments popping up – Austin, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, New York City."  Presler said he’s encouraged by the way Americans have responded to the failed Democrat policies, including New York’s Nassau County where citizens on the outskirts of New York City are sick of the mess left by far-left leaders.  "They just voted red for the first time in decades," he said. "We’re seeing the people are responding to the waves of violent crime and homelessness, and they’re responding by voting conservatively," Presler said.  LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOMELESS COUNT TO BEGIN AFTER COVID-19 SHUTTERED LAST YEAR'S EVENT  When Fox News Digital asked the constantly optimistic Presler which areas of America are in the most distress, he quickly rephrased the question.  "The cities that, we’ll say, need the most love and attention, because I want to put a positive spin on it," Presler said before answering. "Definitely, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, but I will say, the cleanup that I think we had the most impact in doing was in Van Nuys, California."  Presler and his team of volunteers picked up a staggering 50 tons of trash from a homeless encampment in the suburb of Los Angeles.  "It was federal property leased to the state of California, and it had all of this trash, and it had homeless people living there," he said. "The federal government said, ‘We don’t have to clean this up because it’s leased to the state of California,’ the state of California said, ‘California said we don’t have to clean this up because this is federal property,’ so it took private citizens working with the homeless community who opened up the gate to us, who, by the way, donned hazmat suits in 90-plus degree weather to clean up the community."  BIDEN'S HOMELESSNESS CZAR WILL ONLY WORSEN NATION'S CRISIS  Presler thinks the government could clean up America and offer opportunities to improve the lives of the homeless community in one fell swoop if it truly cared.  "If we want to solve homelessness, and we also want to solve the problem of litter in our streets and cities, I love the idea of potentially hiring members of the homeless community… we can provide them with job experience, work experience and also help beautify our cities so that we’re killing two birds with one stone," he said. "If our government really wanted to show that it cares, it will put we the American people first and provide mental health care, providing housing, and providing job opportunities to the American people."  As the conservative activist travels the nation to clean up American cities, he also helps Americans register to vote. This month he traveled to Long Island, New York and set up at various gas stations getting customers who are peeved over bloated gas prices to register as Republicans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I’m very focused on the midterm elections, I’m dedicating this next year exclusively in order to take the House, take the Senate, win governorships and state legislatures across the country, but ultimately that means that we need to expand the electorate and register new voters," he said.  Presler has he’s already made significant impact in Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New York and plans to visit as many states as possible to register Americans to vote for Republican candidates.  "Ultimately, people aren’t responding well to President Joe Biden leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan, they’re not responding well to Joe Biden gifting the Taliban billions of dollars, they’re not responding well to inflation, and gas prices and war with Russia over Ukraine. They’re not responding well to the crisis at the border and the fentanyl epidemic and illegal immigration and MS-13 and sex trafficking," Presler said. "So they’re responding by registering to vote at their current address."

Will Smith’s daughter, Willow Smith, is getting philosophical on Twitter.  The singer and "Red Table Talk" co-host took to the social media platform on Saturday and shared some cryptic tweets about the "meaning of life" following her father’s resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  "The meaning of life is found in a challenge," tweeted the 21-year-old.  "Life is a series of reactions," she wrote in a separate tweet.  LOUIS C.K.’S GRAMMY WIN SPARKS BACKLASH AMID WILL SMITH SLAP AT OSCARS: ‘SO MUCH FOR CANCEL CULTURE’  The actor resigned on Friday following his Oscars slap of Chris Rock and said he would accept any further punishment the organization imposed.  In a statement released on Friday afternoon, the 53-year-old said he will "fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct. My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful and inexcusable."  Film Academy president David Rubin said Smith’s resignation was accepted.  "We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy’s Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18," he confirmed.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  The resignation came two days after the academy’s leadership board met to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Smith for violations against the group’s standards of conduct. Those proceedings could have resulted in suspension or expulsion, and it was not immediately clear what additional punishment he could face.  Had he been expelled, Smith would have joined a small group of men removed from the academy: Harvey Weinstein, Roman Polanski, Bill Cosby and the actor Carmine Caridi, who was kicked out for sharing awards screeners.  On March 27, Smith strode from his front-row Dolby Theatre seat onto the stage and smacked Rock, 57, who had made a joke at the expense of Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Moments later, he went on to win the best actor award for his role in "King Richard."  Rock, who was about to present Oscar for best documentary, declined to file charges when asked by police. He has only briefly addressed the attack publicly, saying at one comedy concert in Boston last week that he was still "kind of processing what happened."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Smith stunned Rock, the theater crowd and viewers at home when he took the stage after Rock joked: "Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it."  Pinkett Smith, 50, who has spoken publicly about her hair loss condition, alopecia, had a closely shaved head similar to that of Demi Moore in the original movie.  After Smith’s attack, he returned to his seat and angrily twice shouted at Rock to "get my wife’s name out your f--king mouth." When Smith took the stage again less than an hour later to accept his Oscar, he tearfully apologized to the Academy but notably omitted any mention of Rock.  The fallout was immediate and intense. Smith had supporters for coming to his wife’s defense, but he was widely condemned for responding with violence and for marring both his long-sought Oscar victory and overshadowing the night’s other winners.  WILL SMITH'S APOLOGY: 10 TIMES OTHER CELEBRITIES SAID THEY WERE SORRY AMID SCANDALS  "I betrayed the trust of the Academy," said Smith in his statement on Friday. "I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film."  "Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason," he concluded his statement.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.  Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage refinance rates have risen for three terms and remained unchanged for one term since last Friday.  Rates last updated on April 4, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. With 5,000 reviews, Credible maintains an "excellent" Trustpilot score.  What this means: Refinance rates have been increasing steadily across all terms since the beginning of 2022. But with 30-year refi rates skyrocketing to 5% last week, and currently holding just under 4.9%, shorter-term refinances are likely the better option for homeowners who want to secure interest savings.  Today’s mortgage rates for home purchases  Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage rates for home purchases have risen for two terms and remained unchanged for two others since last Friday.  Rates last updated on April 4, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).  What this means: Mortgage purchase rates continue to climb, with 30-year rates (the most popular term) rising to 4.875% today. Buyers may find the best combination of interest savings and affordability with 20-year rates, which held steady since Friday and are a full quarter-point lower than 30-year rates. Homebuyers who can manage a larger monthly mortgage payment will find greater interest savings with a shorter repayment term.  To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.  How mortgage rates have changed over time  Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.  The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage or refinance, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.  Are you looking to buy a home?

Thousands of Trustpilot reviewers rate Credible "excellent."  How Credible mortgage rates are calculated  Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.  The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.  Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.  What is a good mortgage rate?  Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount and more.  A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.  If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credible's free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.  Have a finance-related question, but don't know who to ask?

The FBI’s latest Internet Cybercrime Report paints a bleak picture. Last year, Americans lost more than $6.9 billion to cybercrooks.  Don't think you're too smart to fall for their tricks. Even savvy people can get conned out of money before realizing what happened. Tap or click five simple, effective ways to secure your smartphone .  Maybe it's too late, and you've noticed unexpected pop-ups or your phone getting hot when you're not using it. Here’s how to know if a hacker or snoop is already in your smartphone .  Avoiding cybercriminals feels like a feat, but it doesn’t have to be that complicated. Knowledge is power. I’ll walk you through five mistakes you might be making.  1. You think free means safe  Taking advantage of "free" Wi-Fi may cost you more than money. Public networks are unsecured and easy to hack. I'm not just talking about airports. Your local coffee shop, salon, or any place that doesn't password-protect its network leaves you and your data vulnerable.  Since this network is open for use, packet sniffers are readily available online that capture every keystroke you type. Think about this. Your passwords can be seen and collected by criminals.  Use a virtual private network when you need to access the internet and are away from a secure wireless network. A VPN uses an encrypted connection to safeguard against snoops.  You can also use your phone as a hotspot. Tap or click here for iPhone instructions . For steps on an Android, tap or click here .  2. You skip updates  Are you notorious for rescheduling software updates but never actually installing them? If you often hit the "Remind me later" button, you ask for trouble. Don't prevent your system from receiving the latest tools and security patches needed to fight off attackers and malware.  Updates are annoying when you're in the middle of your workday, so schedule them late at night when you're not using your computer. Tap or click here to schedule updates on your Windows PC .  3. You pick up when a scammer calls  Sometimes those scam numbers are mighty convincing. You recognize the area code and maybe even the first few numbers, or perhaps it's your phone number. You pick up. That’s when a scammer has a chance to get their claws into you.  If you see Scam Likely, or whatever term your carrier and phone display, don't answer. I often hear from my national radio show listeners who like to play games with phone scammers. They egg them on and pretend they're interested.  This isn't too bright. You never know if that person is recording your voice for nefarious purposes or even making a deepfake audio recording of you later.  Like what you’re reading? Find the radio station near you that airs my show . You can also get the show’s podcast commercial-free .  4. You have a bunch of old unused accounts  The more online accounts you have, the more at risk you are when hackers come calling. With a new breach around every corner, your usernames and passwords aren't safe.  Step one is combing through your email inbox and phone to locate the accounts you're not using anymore. Then get rid of them. That's not always the easiest thing to do.  Some accounts are impossible to delete, and some sites hide their delete links, and you have to dig pretty deep to find them. Tap or click for a tool that makes it easy to find exactly where to cancel online accounts .  This takes some time, but it’s worth it. When the inevitable data breach is announced from a site you once used, you’ll be glad you did it.  5. You click agree  When was the last time you read a site or service’s terms and conditions? You’re not alone. It probably means you're allowing companies to collect your private data.  I'm not proposing you read every word because I know that's not realistic. But there is a clever way to at least check a few things.  Next time you run into a privacy policy, terms and conditions page, or lengthy terms of service agreement, use a keyboard shortcut to search for specific words.  On a Windows PC, use Control + F .  . On a Mac, use Command + F.  Now, type in terms like "third party," "GPS," "tracking," and "data." You’ll get a quick look at how your info is being used.

"Hunger always follows conflict," noted Rev. Eugene Cho, president and CEO of Bread for the World, a Christian advocacy group that includes individuals, churches, nonprofit groups and other partners, in reference to the Russia-Ukraine war that continues to rage.  Sharing with Fox News Digital in a recent phone interview that his group's "mission is to help end hunger in our country and around the world," Rev. Cho said the crisis of the war in Ukraine has only exacerbated the hunger problem.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "For me, as a Christian and as a Christian pastor, my heart just breaks for the people of Ukraine," he said. "I'm also grieving for the millions of other people whose lives have been impacted in one way or another as a result of this war."  BOSTON-BASED UKRAINIAN WOMAN REVEALS TEXT FROM BROTHER: ‘WE ARE ALIVE’  Rev. Cho pointed out that "so much attention has been taken away from other places around the world that are also going through their own humanitarian crises."  He noted that while this is not a new observation, it is nevertheless "stunning that 4 million Ukrainian refugees have left the country, and obviously they're fleeing to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and other countries," he said. "We're talking about millions more that are internally displaced."  Underneath that layer of truth, he said, "there is a major hunger crisis going on."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: FAITH LEADER SAYS ‘HUMAN LIFE MORE SACRED’ THAN LAND OR OTHER RESOURCES  Part of the reason this is "such dramatic news," he pointed out, is "the fact that Russia and Ukraine account for about 29%-30% of global wheat exports for the entire world."  They are also leading exporters of fertilizer and fuel, said Cho.  "So now, because of those three things — food, fertilizer and fuel — there is a tremendous crisis, throughout that region and around the world. It's why we're advocating so fervently" for help for the suffering, he said.  In terms of how everyday people can pitch in to assist in a meaningful way, Rev. Cho said, "First, I love the fact that people are asking that question. So I want to begin with affirmation."  "We live in a world where the news cycle changes so quickly, where people" become distracted and move onto the next thing, he said.  "So in terms of the war in Ukraine, let's keep asking that question, ‘What can we do?’"  He shared three concrete answers to that question from his point of view.  3 important ways to help  Rev. Cho said, "First, we should be in prayer for the people of Ukraine, for that entire region."  The reason prayer is important is that "it helps our hearts to remain empathetic," he said. "That's a first and very important step toward keeping us in solidarity with people who are suffering."  "We might not be able to solve every problem in the world, but we can do something. We can all care."  Second, he advised, "People can donate to organizations they trust, that resonate with their values, including to Bread for the World."  Then, third, "While we encourage people to donate to organizations that are doing direct relief, our work is unique. The Bread for the World work is around advocacy. We live that advocacy" all day long, he said.  T.D. JAKES, OTHER FAITH LEADERS WEIGH IN ON UKRAINE'S FIGHT FOR FREEDOM  His group — a nonpartisan organization (bread.org) — engages with elected leaders to make them aware of the needs of hungry people all over the world.  In line with this, he said Americans can call their members of Congress and urge them to help those in need. "We encourage Americans to lead with moral, empathetic voices" to help others in crisis, he said.  As a person whose focus is faith forward, Rev. Cho added, "I feel that for me, as a Christian and a pastor — I want to be marked by compassion. And all Christians can have, and do have, a sense of concern and care about what's going on among those who are suffering," he said.  "At a time when so many people are feeling a little helpless or hopeless, all we're called to do is to do what we can, to invest in compassion and mercy."  "We might not be able to solve every problem in the world — and it's not necessarily our job to do that — but we can do something. We can care," he said. "At a time when so many people are feeling a little helpless or hopeless, all we're called to do is to do what we can, to invest in compassion and mercy."  He added poignantly that his own father, who is 86 today, lived through the Korean War — "and he spent time separated from his family. He lived in a refugee camp" during that war, said Rev. Cho.  "These are human beings who are created in the image of God. They deserve dignity, peace, stability — and may we each do our part."  He also "experienced severe hunger," said Cho. "My father has recounted stories of pulling out grass from the ground to consume it, to satisfy his hunger pangs."  So "watching the [war] news on television with my father in recent weeks has been very, very emotional," he said. "And I realize as I'm processing the news, he's actually reliving the past in some ways."  Rev. Cho said he's grateful that his father came out of the war situation decades ago "not only alive, but able to reunite with his family" — and able to move forward in his life.  MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS, WALKED THE PATH OF ALL STRUGGLING MOTHERS TODAY  "And so I would just like to remind people that whoever they are, whatever they are going through, whatever their faith background may be or may not be — and as they're watching the news, listening to the news — we should never forget that this is not about mere statistics, or faceless, nameless people."  He added, "These are human beings who are created in the image of God. They deserve dignity, peace, stability — and may we each do our part."  Bread for the World assists anyone who wants to reach out to members of Congress or other elected officials.  Rev. Cho pointed out that people in countries such as Afghanistan — which may not be at the top of news coverage right now, though it was, of course, months ago and well before that — are still suffering from severe food shortages and hunger crises.  He also named Yemen; food prices "have more than doubled in that country."  "I am urging our leaders to lead — to demonstrate to other nations and other leaders what it means to lead with empathetic, moral courage."  He made clear it is not the U.S.'s job to take care of every problem worldwide.  "But I am urging our leaders to lead — to demonstrate to other nations and other leaders what it means to lead with empathetic, moral courage."

He is married and a father of three.  Bread for the World was founded in 1974. It is a 501c3 organization; donations are tax-deductible. Charity Navigator, the world's largest nonprofit evaluator, rates it highly and says that people can "give with confidence."

A restaurant in France has reportedly received threats over its signature dish, poutine, because some people have been incorrectly associating the dish with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  La Maison de la Poutine, which has locations in Paris and Toulouse, posted a statement on social media last week saying that it has received "calls of insults and even threats" over its name, according to a translation of the French statement.  Though the name may sound similar to the Russian president, poutine has no actual connection Putin. Poutine, which originated in Canada, is made of French fries, cheese curds and gravy.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  In its statement, La Maison de la Poutine clarified that it "is not linked to the Russian regime and its leader."  "Our dish was born in Quebec in the 1950s," the restaurant said. "And the stories to tell its origin are numerous. But one thing is certain: the poutine was created by passionate cooks who wanted to bring joy and comfort to their customers."  CANADIAN DINER REMOVES POUTINE FROM NAME BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE PUTIN  La Maison de la Poutine went on to say that it offers "its most sincere support to the Ukrainian people who fight courageously for their freedom, against the tyrannical Russian regime."  HOW AMERICAN CITIES ARE HELPING THEIR UKRAINIAN SISTER CITIES  This isn’t the first time someone has made the connection that poutine sounds like Putin.  Fox News Digial previously reported that a diner in Drummondville, Quebec, Le Roy Jucep, decided to take the word "poutine" out of its trademark to show solidarity with Ukraine after Russia invaded the country – and to make people smile.  Le Roy Jucep, which claims to have invented poutine, posted its decision to remove the word "poutine" from its name, though the dish is still available on its menu.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The business's Facebook page still lists it as the inventor of "poutine," although the name has been changed to say "The Inventor of Fries, Cheese and Gravy."  Though Le Roy Jucep reportedly received some hateful replies and phone calls for the change, it also got plenty of love.  In a post on Facebook, the restaurant wrote: "Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that's already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts."

After the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Oksana Kononets and her mother were determined to arrive in America for a special cause.    Earlier this month, the 29-year-old appeared in an annual fashion show hosted by Runway of Dreams, a nonprofit that supports adaptive clothing for people with disabilities. The model was left paralyzed at age 19 after she injured her spine caused by a fall from the fifth floor. She has used a wheelchair since 2012.    Kononets told Fox News Digital she was due to fly to Los Angeles on Feb. 26 for the show. But two days prior, on Feb. 24, Russia launched a full-scale attack on her home country.    "I remember how Kyiv was bombed," she said. "I remember everything. Mama took our luggage and we headed to the train station. We didn’t know which direction to go. We just found a free space on the train and started to move. It was a huge crowd. But we needed to leave."  FORMER MISS UKRAINE VERONIKA DIDUSENKO RECALLS HER ESCAPE WITH SON AMID RUSSIAN INVASION: 'I HAD TO SURVIVE'  Kononets and her mother embarked on a five-day journey from Ukraine’s capital. During the trip, she and many others spent 11 hours on a train to Poland for safety.    "It was very hard to bring my wheelchair to the train," she said. "One part broke. We tried to do everything we could to fix it. We also didn’t know where to stay. Should we stay in Ukraine? In Warsaw? Or somewhere else in Europe? I was scared and very tired. We needed to be safe."    "I remember during my journey so many of us trying to leave, wondering where can we stay," she shared. "There were grandmothers, 90-year-olds, with their pets. They didn’t want to leave their loved ones behind."    After Kononets and her mother arrived in Poland, they traveled to the Netherlands. From there, they secured a flight to the U.S. with the help of a friend. And on March 5, the pair landed safely in Los Angeles.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  "Throughout our journey, all we could think about was Ukraine and what was happening to my country, my people," she said. "My friends stayed to serve and protect Ukraine and help as volunteers. I think of them constantly. While yes, Los Angeles surrounds me with beautiful nature, kind people and peace, I still think of my home. And I hear of friends who are killed. It’s too hard."    Just days after landing in America, Kononets appeared on the runway. She said her goal was to raise awareness of people with disabilities who want to pursue careers in fashion. She also wanted to represent her pride for Ukraine.    "Before my accident, I worked as a makeup artist," she explained. "After the trauma, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t be without work. But when I saw a girl in a wheelchair with the same disability who was a model, I found purpose. If she could do it, why can’t I? For two years, I worried I couldn’t do anything. That I was useless. But that image helped me recover. And since 2015, I worked as a model. It has been a dream to be on a runway even before the war."    "When the war happened, I wanted to show, more than ever, that Ukrainian women are strong and have big dreams," she continued. "I came to not only represent me but to represent what we’re capable of. I found strength in myself, and I felt support from my friends and family in this long, hard journey. But I know today that I have the power to fulfill my dream. I’m proud to be Ukrainian. It’s a huge honor. And I want to represent that."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Kononets said she’s grateful for being in America. But her family remains on her mind constantly. Her father, sister and grandmother, who is 83, are still in Ukraine. The patriarch lost work after his business was bombed.    "The most important thing is that we’re alive," she said. "We are thinking of our future. I’m thinking maybe here, I can try to find work in fashion as a model. That way, I can support my family. I would also like to volunteer and give back. Anything to help my family and those leaving Ukraine."    "Right now there is a shortage of medicine in Ukraine," she said. "This is a problem for people who have asthma and [other ailments]. We need more support in the medical field. It’s very hard. Just two days ago, my father stood in the queue to buy bread. He stood for two and a half hours. The other day he couldn’t move his foot. But today, I spoke with him, and he’s doing OK. But you wonder, when will this end?"    Kononets also commended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s efforts during the devastating conflict.  KATHERYN WINNICK SAYS ZELENSKYY IS 'PERFECT EXAMPLE' OF 'UKRAINIAN STRONG': 'A TRUE LEADER'  "He has done good work as a president," she said. "I also think it would be good if people can come to the USA. Europe right now, it’s very full. So many people escaped Ukraine and moved to other cities. Now more than ever, we need to support each other in the world."    Kononets said she and her mother are taking it a day at a time as they stay closely connected with their family in Ukraine. She is hopeful to find work in the fashion industry that will allow her to continue raising awareness on those with disabilities, which will also help support her loved ones back home.    She remains hopeful that her country will persevere, noting that her people are "strong."    "Never give up," said Kononets. "You have to believe in yourself, no matter what. You can become stronger after something terrible happens to you. Dreams can come true."  UKRAINIAN POP STAR DETAILS ESCAPE FROM WAR TO US TO USE HER VOICE: 'THE WAR MUST BE STOPPED'  Russian President Vladimir Putin has labeled the attack on Ukraine a "special military mission." The invasion has sparked worldwide condemnation. Hundreds have already been reported either dead or wounded, including children. Millions have fled or attempted to escape the country.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Bella means beautiful, but Bella Hadid didn’t think she was when she was a teenager.  Supermodel Bella Hadid is finally coming clean about having plastic surgery, but she is speaking out on her regret of having it done when she was 14, according to a Vogue report last week .  "I was the uglier sister. I was the brunette. I wasn’t as cool as [my sister] Gigi, not as outgoing," the twenty-five-year-old said.  "That’s really what people said about me. And unfortunately when you get told things so many times, you do just believe it."  Hadid, who was born at Georgetown Hospital in Washington, D.C., but grew up in California, regrets having the cosmetic procedure done on her nose when she was so young, admitting, "I think I would have grown into it."  Approximately 229,000 cosmetic surgeries were performed on teenagers between the ages of 13 to 19 in 2017, with teenagers accounting for approximately four percent of all cosmetic procedures, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons .  BELLA HADID SPORTS ‘PALESTINE’ JEWELRY WHILE OUT ON THE TOWN WITH FRIENDS  But the plastic surgery experts caution that rhinoplasty, otherwise known as a "nose job," is not recommended until the growth of the nose is completed, which is typically around ages 15 to 16 in females and ages 16 to 18 in males, although in certain situations, such as a child with cleft lip, the procedure may be performed earlier.  "Some teens are more psychologically mature than others, but it's important to note that their brain development is not at a point where they can really think through long term implications and they aren't able to fully appreciate what the consequences might be," said Dr. Diana Zuckerman president of the National Center for Health Research.  Recent research by Drs. Rod J. Rohrich and Min-Jeong Cho, board certified plastic surgeons, found few guidelines that ensure teen plastic surgeries are performed appropriately .  "While a rhinoplasty or ear surgery can be performed safely by a board-certified surgeon and are, in many cases, appropriate for an adolescent, other cosmetic procedures such as breast augmentation, liposuction or injectables are typically not recommended for minors for several reasons, including lack of research," said Dr. Rohrich .  He is also concerned of the surge in young people asking for injectables to achieve augmented cheeks and lips despite the lack of evidence they are safe for adolescents.  "Girls nowadays live in a culture with so much pressure to change their appearances, whether it's putting on makeup or something more extreme like cosmetic surgery," said Leora Tanenbaum, feminist author of "I Am Not a Slut."  "But rather than judging or shaming individuals [like Hadid], we need to think more collectively about the pressures young women face to look a certain way."  Cosmetic procedures improve confidence by providing more of a psychological boost in teenagers rather than the actual physical changes, especially those who are bullied or have poor self-esteem, according to Dr. Steven Pearlman, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon.  HOW TO BUILD A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE IN YOUR CHILD  Even though it’s legal for plastic surgeons to perform procedures on anyone less than 18 with parental or guardian consent, Pearlman notes it’s important that teenagers have the emotional maturity to appreciate the risks of having procedures, such as infection, bleeding and scarring for a rhinoplasty, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  Given teenagers bodies are still developing, other experts blame the "surveillance culture" where the outsiders constantly critique the physical appearance of women, where those who appear different from the societal standard are pressured to change -- especially those of color who don’t meet the mold of the "Eurocentric feminine ideal," according to USA Today.  "It speaks to the fact that women exist in this impossible space where we have to be real but not too real. We have to enhance our appearance but if we enhance it 'too much,' then we're not authentic," said Tanenbaum.  Zuckerman argues in an ideal world surgeons would use more discretion to delay certain surgeries in teens, while parents would work with their children to delay decisions of cosmetic procedures " … until a teenager is of age, like at least 18."  "I wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors," Hadid said.

Fashion can make you or break you. And if it makes you, you have to make a conscious effort every day for it not to break you."

Contrary to observational studies, alcohol consumption may not actually counter the risk of heart disease, according to a large study published in JAMA Network Open this week.  Previous observational studies suggested that consuming small amounts of alcohol may provide heart-related health benefits, but a team of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard found in a recent study that alcohol intake at all levels was linked with higher risks of cardiovascular disease.  The Boston researchers suggested that the supposed benefits of drinking alcohol might actually be attributed to other healthy lifestyle factors that are typically followed among light to moderate drinkers, the study said.  LOWER RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH AVOCADO CONSUMPTION: STUDY  "The findings affirm that alcohol intake should not be recommended to improve cardiovascular health; rather, that reducing alcohol intake will likely reduce cardiovascular risk in all individuals, albeit to different extents based on one’s current level of consumption," the study’s senior author, Dr. Krishna Aragam, a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and an associate scientist at MIT's Broad Institute, said in a news release.  The researchers defined the drinking groups as abstainers (0 drinks per week.), light drinkers (>0-8.4 drinks per week), moderate (>8.4- 15.4 drinks per week), heavy (>15.4-24.5 drinks per week) and abusive (>24.5 drinks per week), according to the study.  The investigators used analyses of genetic and medical data of over 371,000 people, averaging 57 years of age and reportedly consumed nine drinks per week, who participated in the U.K. Biobank (a British database used by scientists and investigators to study genes and their association with health), according to a news release. The authors also said the finding showing the link between heart risk and drinking was exponential rather than linear was supported by their additional analysis of data from more than 30,000 U.S. participants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank.  ALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS JUMPED DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: STUDY  According to the study, the Boston researchers observed consistent findings with previous studies where light to moderate drinkers had the lowest heart disease risk, followed by non-drinkers. They also found individuals who consumed heavy amounts of alcohol had the highest risk of heart disease.  The investigators also found light to moderate drinkers tended to engage in healthier lifestyles that included less smoking and more physical activity and increased vegetable intake in their diets, as compared to those who did not drink. The investigators suggested that these lifestyle factors might play a more significant role in lowering the risk of heart disease, rather than the consumption of alcohol, according to the study.  DRINKING MAY SHRINK THE BRAIN EVEN IN MODERATE AMOUNTS, STUDY SUGGESTS  The researchers relied on Mendelian randomization, a method used to help determine cause and effect whereas previous published studies were observational, meaning a correlation but not causation was found, researchers explained to Fox News.  The researchers used the Mendelian randomization technique along with analyzing phenotypic and genetic data from participants, to understand the association and determine if consuming light levels of alcohol can actually cause an individual to be protected against developing heart disease, the release said.  "Newer and more advanced techniques in ‘non-linear Mendelian randomization’ now permit the use of human genetic data to evaluate the direction and magnitude of disease risk associated with different levels of an exposure," Aragam said in the release.  DRINKING 2-3 CUPS OF COFFEE DAILY COULD BENEFIT THE HEART, STUDIES SAY  The group found upon conducting genetic analysis of the participants that individuals with genetic variants that predicted higher alcohol consumption were actually likely to drink more alcohol, and more likely to have coronary artery disease and high blood pressure, the study said.  The study analysis found substantial differences in risk of heart disease and high blood pressure in both men and women as the number of drinks consumed increased.  The authors wrote in the release that there were "minimal increases in risk when consuming zero to seven drinks per week, much higher risk increases when progressing from seven to 14 drinks per week, and especially high risk when consuming 21 or more drinks per week."  The findings also suggested that there is an increased risk for cardiovascular disease even when consuming less than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women, which is the "low risk" levels established by the national guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The researchers said their findings of the exponential relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of heart diseases was supported further when they analyzed additional data from over 30,000 individuals from a Mass General Brigham Bank. They concluded in the study that cutting back on alcohol intake cannot only benefit people who drink one alcoholic beverage per day, but it may have substantial health gains in those who consume more.  HEART DISEASE, STROKE DEATHS ROSE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: STUDY  Dr. Maryann McLaughlin, a cardiologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC, was not involved in the study but commented to Fox News: "This article adds to the growing literature that alcohol is not good for the heart. We now have more evidence that alcohol can increase risk for atrial fibrillation or other irregular heart rhythms. Moderate to heavy use of alcohol can lead to physiologic and anatomical changes in the heart."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Dr. Evelina Grayver, the director of the Women’s Heart Program at the Katz Institute for Women’s Health in Northwell Health’s Central Region in New York, also commented on the study to Fox News and said, "The study is phenomenal. It is clear that we can no longer look at just one factor alone in regards to risks for heart disease. It is interesting that the study linked the amount of drinking with other life habits. And it makes absolute sense that those patients who drink excessively have other poor life habits and risk factors, including smoking, obesity and a more sedentary lifestyle all lead to heart disease."  Gravyer, who is also the board of directors vice president at the American Heart Association of Long Island, added: "Similarly, those who do not drink at all may not give themselves an opportunity to take a moment to relax and possibly decrease their stress levels."

Ukraine native Lana Gazhenko, the head custodian at Oak Hill Elementary School in Covington, Georgia, has been with the school since it first opened its door 21 years ago.  In that period of time, she's come to view her workplace as a second home.  Known affectionately around the school as "Miss Lana," the Ukrainian American was reminded this month of just how much family she has at Oak Hill when teachers and students decorated the halls in honor of Ukraine amid the attacks on that country by Russia.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The idea of a couple of classrooms [of kids] coloring sunflowers to show support to Miss Lana sparked on a Tuesday morning — and by the end of the school day, all students from pre-K to fifth grade and even teachers had created a piece of art to show support to Miss Lana," third-grade teacher Jesse Daniel told Fox News Digital.  "Miss Lana is right when she said that Oak Hill is a family, so it was no surprise when the entire school united to help complete the ‘Sunflower Garden of Hope,'" Daniel said.  Gazhenko has many family members still living in Ukraine.  Overall, more than 4 million people have fled Ukraine so far during the war with Russia, according to the United Nations, as Fox News Digital reported on March 30.  UKRAINIAN-BORN WOMAN SAYS HER IDENTITY WAS STOLEN ONLINE  Since Gazhenko is a special individual to everyone at the school, staff and students felt it was important to demonstrate support and love, Daniel added.  "I was first speechless and just started crying." — Custodian Lana Gazhenko  Gazhenko told Fox News Digital, "My school, kids, teachers made me a really big surprise," she said of the art display.  Gazhenko discovered her surprise when she walked into the school building and was welcomed with colorful "Hope for Ukraine" artwork.  She deeply appreciated everything the community did for her.  "I was first speechless and just started crying," she said.  "I was not expecting all this to be for me and for my support," Gazhenko added.  "Oak Hill family is family, you know — not just school, not just work. This is family."  In an emotional video shared with Fox News Digital, Gazhenko appeared overwhelmed by the sweet gesture.  "We support you, Lana," a colleague of Gazhenko's can be heard saying to her in the clip. "We love you."  UKRAINIAN BAKER WHO RAISED $150K FOR HER HOME COUNTRY HELPS FAMILY REACH SAFETY AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR  In the video, a teacher revealed that students and staff incorporated the names of some of Gazhenko's own family members from Ukraine into the art.  Gazhenko said she's asking the world to pray for the people of Ukraine during this time of extreme hardship and suffering.  The school launched a GoFundMe titled, "Direct Help for Ukrainian Families in Need" on behalf of Gazhenko. She's been flooded with requests from locals and strangers asking her how they can help the Ukrainian people.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The funds will go to Gazhenko's family as well as to other Ukrainians seeking refuge.  Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

Besides the 11-point agenda he hopes Republicans will run on in the midterms, he is also emphasizing the need to confront the economic and military threats from China.  Earlier this week on the FOX News Rundown, host Jessica Rosenthal spoke to Sen Rick Scott about both his “Plan To Rescue America” agenda and China’s growing influence in the world.  Scott answered Democrat and Republic critics about his plan that included controversial economic and social policy changes. The Senator also emphasized need to focus on American manufacturing to both strengthen America and weaken China.  Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the conversation in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear the entire discussion with Sen. Rick Scott and hear more about why he thinks the GOP should adopt his policies and whether he plans on running for President in 2024.

Hurd feels we got the resolve of the Russians wrong and the levels the Ukrainians would go to defend their country. Hurd points to how the Ukrainians defended their country once before in 2014 when the Russians first went into Ukraine. When the Russians tried to go into Kyiv, Hurd points to how the Ukrainians pushed the Russians back when they had even less equipment and were less organized than they are now in their fight against Russia. Hurd believes we need to do everything we can to help Ukraine while they have momentum on their side. Hurd also wants the Biden Administration to do more to build a bigger posse of allies to deal with Russia and continuing Chinese aggression. Hurd is concerned many countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa are not participating in sanctions against Russia. Hurd wants America to work more at getting the rest of our hemisphere together in this fight against Russia.  Hurd also addressed the border crisis and the Biden administration ending Title 42. Hurd says we must stop treating everybody like an asylum seeker. Hurd believes he can make an argument you don’t need Title 42 in order to deport more people because you can’t come here illegally. Hurd went on to say, when you treat everybody as if they’re an asylum seeker, you impact the people that are truly asylum seekers. Another area that Hurd wants us to do more about is dismantling human smuggling networks. Hurd asks why are we not using the entire resources of the U.S. Intelligence Committee community to dismantle some of these operations? Hurd says we know the license plates of the busses and cell phones of those moving people across the border.  Click here to order “American Reboot: An Idealist’s Guide to Getting Big Things Done”

Cornyn says if the reports are true, it is shameful the Biden Administration is putting pressure on Zelenskyy to cut a deal with Putin. Cornyn went on to say, if there is a deal cut, allowing Putin to maintain his position in Eastern Ukraine with Crimea and the land that he has captured so far, this is going to happen again. When asked about the mindset of Putin, Cornyn responded that Putin is not crazy, but he does have fantasies on restoring the Russian Empire. Cornyn says that is the ideology driving Putin and if we think he is going to quit we are fooling ourselves.

Yingst remembered FOX News Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski saying,  “Another story and experience that Pierre and I share together, we were in Kabul after the Taliban took over in Afghanistan last year and we went to an amusement park together to talk to Afghan civilians who were now living under Taliban control. And while we were there, we interviewed a mother with her two kids, and the father had been killed in the blast at HQ at Kabul’s airport. And as we were conducting this interview, the mom told us that her daughter’s birthday was next week, but they couldn’t afford a cake for her and she started to cry. And so before we left, the amusement park pier stopped by the snack stand, and he said, I’ll take one of everything. And he went and he found this little girl and he gave her all of the snacks. And he said, How’s that for you? Happy birthday. And the look on the mother’s face, I’ll never forget because she was so thankful of this act of kindness. And it’s just one of countless examples that we heard celebrating his life of Pierre being kind to others and expecting nothing in return. And I think that allowed us access when we were working together that other people couldn’t get. He could make even the most dangerous men smile. He could make them laugh. There was another time in Afghanistan where we came across the infamous Haqqani network and this gunman was staying in the presidential palace that they had taken over in Kabul. And later in the day, I see him face time in someone. He gets off the phone and I said, Who is that? He’s like, Oh, that was one of the guys outside the Ministry of Defense earlier. I said one of the Haqqani Network fighters. And he said, yeah, yeah, he was showing me the presidential palace and well, it just gives you a sense of this guy could make anyone feel comfortable. And that’s exactly what you need on your team when you’re in the field.”

But it is so widespread and so serious for the entire population of Ukraine that it’s limited in how much people are lighthearted because they are literally experiencing a nightmare. It’s unfolding all around them. It’s the sirens. When there are air raids, it’s the explosions in the distance. It’s watching their children or trying to shield their children from seeing bodies in the streets. It’s these really heavy, heavy things. But amid that, there are these moments of humanity, and sometimes it’s just helping an old lady across a bridge that’s been bombed out and she’s escaping her home. Sometimes, as we saw in the metro system of Kiev, someone sharing a piece of bread with another person who is sheltering, trying to get away from the bombing. And so you have all of these moments together, and I think it’s important to highlight them in our coverage because it’s really easy amid the chaos to just focus on the bombs and the bullets and the loud bangs that happened behind us. But we have to, as journalists, dig into that and figure out, well, who’s affected here and how do we make people care about their story?”  To hear what else Trey had to say, listen to the podcast!
