Officials said Mr. Biden had struggled for days about whether to ban Russian oil imports amid concerns about whether it would accelerate the already rapid rise in the price of gasoline in the U.S.  WASHINGTON — President Biden is expected on Tuesday morning to ban the importation of Russian oil into the United States, a senior administration official said, making the move after pressure from lawmakers in both parties to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.  Mr. Biden is scheduled to make the announcement at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday from the White House. In a statement, the administration said Mr. Biden would “announce actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”  The move would shut off the relatively small flow of oil into the United States, which receives less than 10 percent of its energy resources from Russia. But Republicans and Democrats in Congress had been urging the president to take the step to ensure that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not profiting from American purchases of oil.  Officials said Mr. Biden had struggled for days about whether to take the step amid concerns about whether it would accelerate the already rapid rise in the price of gasoline at the pumps — a potent political issue for Americans in a critical election year.  Already, concern about disruptions in the flow of oil around the world has pushed up the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil. On Tuesday morning, Brent crude hit $130 a barrel. It has been as high as $139 a barrel, up 26 percent over the past week.  And on Monday, anticipation of a ban on oil by the United States shook financial markets. The S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its sharpest daily decline since October 2020. The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.6 percent and is now 20 percent off its November record.  But the pressure on Mr. Biden to act has been intense. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress began discussing on Monday legislation that would ban Russian oil and suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, has repeatedly endorsed those actions, telling reporters last week: “I’m all for that. Ban it.”  It was not immediately clear when the ban would take effect. The United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere have already imposed severe sanctions and export restrictions on Russia. The threat of those sanctions was initially designed to try to deter an invasion from happening in the first place  Those steps — which failed to prevent the war — include freezing the assets of major Russian banks and Mr. Putin’s wealthy Russian friends, cutting some Russian banks off from the international banking system, and blocking Russia from acquiring certain imports, including high-tech equipment.  Mr. Biden and his counterparts had purposely exempted energy resources from those sanctions in an effort to ensure the steady flow of natural gas and oil throughout the world.  But it is unlikely that Mr. Biden will be joined by the leaders of European countries, officials said. Europe gets about 30 percent of its oil from Russia, and leaders there have been wary of taking a step that would cut off that supply.  The president met virtually with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany on Monday morning to discuss the issue.  On Monday — before news of Mr. Biden’s announcement — Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, warned that Russia could cut Europe off from the delivery of natural gas through a pipeline if the allies move to stop importing Russian oil.  “It is absolutely clear that a rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,” Mr. Novak said.  “European politicians need to honestly warn their citizens and consumers what to expect,” he said. “If you want to reject energy supplies from Russia, go ahead. We are ready for it. We know where we could redirect the volumes to.”  Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said Tuesday that Americans needed to be ready for the consequences if Russia retaliated, a move he said would be aimed at dividing the allies.  “We might well see energy prices double because Putin realizes that he’s got Western Europe over a barrel,” Mr. Coons said on CNN.

Why have the Russians performed so poorly in the early days of the war? Why did they so badly misjudge the Ukrainian resistance?  His careful response, before reporters in Estonia: “We’ve seen a large, combined-arms, multi-axis invasion of the second-largest country in Europe, Ukraine, by Russian air, ground, special forces, intelligence forces,” he said, before describing some of the bombardment brought by Russia and his concern over its “indiscriminate firing” on civilians.  “It’s a little bit early to draw any definitive lessons learned,” he added. “But one of the lessons that’s clearly evident is that the will of the people, the will of the Ukrainian people, and the importance of national leadership and the fighting skills of the Ukrainian army has come through loud and clear.”  While the Russian army’s troubles are real, the public’s view of the fight is skewed by the realities of the information battlefield. Russia remains keen to play down the war and provides little information about its victories or defeats, contributing to an incomplete picture.  But a dissection of the Russian military’s performance so far, compiled from interviews with two dozen American, NATO and Ukrainian officials, paints a portrait of young, inexperienced conscripted soldiers who have not been empowered to make on-the-spot decisions, and a noncommissioned officer corps that isn’t allowed to make decisions either. Russia’s military leadership, with Gen. Valery Gerasimov at the top, is far too centralized; lieutenants must ask him for permission even on small matters, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.  In addition, the Russian senior officers have proved so far to be risk-averse, the officials said.  Their caution partly explains why they still don’t have air superiority over all of Ukraine, for example, American officials said. Faced with bad weather in northern Ukraine, the Russian officers grounded some Russian attack planes and helicopters, and forced others to fly at lower altitudes, making them more vulnerable to Ukrainian ground fire, a senior Pentagon official said.  “Most Russian capabilities have been sitting on the sidelines,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a defense research institute, in an email. “The force employment is completely irrational, preparations for a real war near nonexistent and morale incredibly low because troops were clearly not told they would be sent into this fight.”

For the oil companies, three decades of carefully nurturing investments in what was always a difficult political environment is poised to quickly go by the boards. But the high point of Western involvement in Russia passed years ago, pushed along in part by outrage over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.  The Russian oil industry, though, is likely to experience a wrenching reworking about how it does business in the coming weeks, months and even years. In the short term, this painful reckoning will come not so much because blue-chip oil companies are leaving, but because Russian oil and gas have suddenly become toxic to many buyers.  On Tuesday, President Biden plans to announce a ban on Russian oil imports to the United States, a move aimed at further penalizing Russia. Earlier in the day, Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said it would stop buying the country’s oil and gas and “withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons.”

But mostly it stays in Marina di Carrara, where it has been moored since last September.  Locals have their own theory about the ship’s ownership. Some have heard people onboard speaking Russian. And Scheherazade is also the title of a symphony by the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  “Everybody calls it Putin’s yacht, but nobody knows whose it is,” said Ernesto Rossi, a retired clerk who was taking a walk along the marina’s promenade on Friday. “It’s a rumor that’s been going around for months.”  In Italy, the phrase “Putin’s yacht” has become shorthand for a mysterious and ultra-luxurious ship. It’s also a joke among the dozens of crew members, Captain Bennett-Pearce said. “I’ve heard the same rumors.”  Another, smaller vessel, the Graceful, has long been tied to the Russian president and is known as “Putin’s yacht.” It was tracked leaving Germany for the Russian port of Kaliningrad just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine. (U.S. government officials point out that Mr. Putin owns little outright; many of the luxurious homes or ships he uses are owned by oligarchs.)  Mr. Putin appears to have a penchant for big pleasure boats. During his time as Russia’s leader, he’s been photographed on yachts from Russia’s northern reaches to the Black Sea in the south. Last May, he and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, took a cruise on a yacht at the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.  The Scheherazade’s builder, Lurssen Group, whose website promises customers “complete confidentiality,” declined to comment about its ownership. Until June 2020, when the completed ship left the pier in Bremen, Germany, it had the code name “Lightning.” The same company built the even bigger superyacht the Dilbar. A similar gigantic yacht, code-named “Luminance,” is now being built at Lurssen, scheduled to be completed next year.

Putin a question that was perfectly crafted to conform with new government rules for reporting on his invasion of Ukraine.  “We all support your actions, the special military operation that is proceeding there,” said one pilot, seated among some 20 women in Aeroflot uniforms at a long table, each with her own clear glass teapot. “We know that civilians do not suffer, but please reassure us what is at the end of this path.”  Mr. Putin responded with a litany of his grievances against Ukraine, but neither his answer nor any of the questions mentioned the reality of Ukraine — the violent destruction of cities and towns by the Russian military, the civilian deaths, the desperate exodus by millions of refugees. With virtually all media now under state control, that has all disappeared from domestic television screens and newspaper headlines.  To spend several days watching news broadcasts on the main state channels, as well as surveying state-controlled newspapers, is to witness the extent of the Kremlin’s efforts to sanitize its war with the Orwellian term “special military operation” — and to make all news coverage align with that message.

Putin tightened his grip on Russian society over the past 22 years, small pockets of independent information and political expression remained online.  Any remnants of that are now gone.  As Mr. Putin has waged war on Ukraine, a digital barricade went up between Russia and the world. Both Russian authorities and multinational internet companies built the wall with breathtaking speed. And the moves have ruptured an open internet that was once seen as helping to integrate Russia into the global community.  TikTok and Netflix are suspending their services in the country. Facebook has been blocked. Twitter has been partly blocked, and YouTube’s future is in doubt. Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and others have pulled back or withdrawn entirely from Russia. Even online video games like Minecraft are no longer available.  The actions have turned Russia into a walled-off digital state akin to China and Iran, which tightly control the internet and censor foreign websites and dissent. China’s internet and the Western internet have become almost completely separate over the years, with few overlapping services and little direct communication. In Iran, the authorities have used internet blackouts during protests.

He had an exaggerated view of his own nation’s military might; my description last week of Russia as a Potemkin superpower, with far less strength than meets the eye, looks even truer now. He vastly underrated Ukrainian morale and military prowess, and failed to anticipate the resolve of democratic governments — especially, although not only, the Biden administration, which, in case you haven’t noticed, has done a remarkable job on everything from arming Ukraine to rallying the West around financial sanctions.  I can’t add anything to the discussion of the war itself, although I will note that much of the commentary I’ve been reading says that Russian forces are regrouping and will resume large-scale advances in a day or two — and has been saying that, day after day, for more than a week.  What I think I can add, however, is some analysis of the effects of sanctions, and in particular an answer to one question I keep being asked: Can China, by offering itself as an alternative trading partner, bail out Putin’s economy?  No, it can’t.  Let’s talk first about the impact of those sanctions.  One thing the West conspicuously hasn’t done is try to block Russian sales of oil and gas — the country’s principal exports. Oh, the United States might ban imports of Russian oil, but this would be a symbolic gesture: Oil is traded on a global market, so this would just reshuffle trade a bit, and in any case U.S. imports from Russia account for only about 5 percent of Russian production.

In response, the West threatened moderate sanctions, but ultimately showed little interest in stepping between Russia and Ukraine.  Then came the war, and everything changed. Russia’s invasion met with valiant Ukrainian resistance. President Volodymyr Zelensky became an international hero. NATO countries unified behind a truly punishing sanctions regime and significant military support. Russia’s attack strengthened Ukraine’s national identity — and its desire to join the European Union. A conflict that the U.S. and Europe were treating as purely strategic is now a conflict about the West’s most fundamental values.  [You can listen to this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]  Much of this has felt hopeful, even inspiring, to those watching from the comfort of home. But it has the potential to unleash a truly terrifying spiral of escalation. Putin, feeling backed into a corner, has raised the stakes. Last week, he called the West’s sanctions akin to an act of war and has put Russia’s nuclear arsenal on alert. And the global wave of support for Ukraine has made it increasingly difficult for Western leaders to de-escalate. In the fog of war, it isn’t hard to imagine an accident or miscommunication that triggers a World War III-like scenario.

Then in the Soviet Union, the city had belonged to Poland for about 400 years and been a place where Poles, Ukrainians, Jews and Armenians lived side by side. In my youth, I was suffused with this borderland identity and thought of myself as existing at the intersection of cultures, never fully beholden to one. So when the Soviet Union fell, I wasn’t very interested in the new Ukrainian state. Instead, I longed to see Paris, Rome and Madrid, with their churches and museums, even if it meant half-starving, sleeping in parks and hitchhiking.  After my travels, I wanted to settle somewhere — and chose Poland, fulfilling my grandmother’s dream of living in the country. I didn’t even call it emigration: My hometown, after all, was only about 185 miles away. But after Poland joined the European Union in 2004, the border between the two countries, previously so easily passed, was garlanded with barbed wire. To get into the country, Ukrainians had to wait in a special line, much longer than E.U. citizens.  I began to dream about the abolition of the border. If Ukraine joined the European Union, say, I would be able to cherish once more my borderland identity — and things could look a bit like the Second Polish Republic, the interwar state where Poles, Ukrainians and other nationalities lived side by side. It was not, of course, an idyll: The Polish state dealt harshly with minorities, and Ukrainians who wanted to study in their own language or practice their religion faced oppression. Between Ukraine and Poland, there are still many “no-go areas.”  At the time, I didn’t really think of myself as Ukrainian. I was from Lviv, spoke Russian, Polish and Ukrainian, and lived in Poland: That seemed like enough. But as I was dreaming about the border falling between us, the Orange Revolution — a series of protests that expressed not only Ukrainians’ opposition to corruption but also, more profoundly perhaps, their European longings — broke out in Ukraine in 2004. At a solidarity demonstration in Krakow, I found myself, for the first time in my life, holding the blue-and-yellow flag. It was, my friend said, the conception of my Ukrainian identity.  For the next decade or so, it went no further. I have relatives and friends on both sides of the border, and I was regularly here and there. I followed events in Ukraine at a distance, as if wary of what could come from full immersion. I knew some educated, talented young Ukrainians who tried to build the new country. After a couple of years they were broken, burned out and bitterly disappointed by corruption that seemed to be unconquerable. In Poland, meanwhile, I continued to build a life for myself. I married, had children and worked away at my first novel, inspired in part by the colorful Ukrainian revolution.

Sadly, that figure is likely to grow.  To ease the suffering caused by Vladimir Putin’s invasion and strengthen our position against him, the United States should open its doors both to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict and to Russians seeking to escape Mr. Putin’s tyranny.  There are several things we can do quickly: President Biden has taken a valuable first step by making Ukrainians in the United States eligible for temporary protected status, which will shield them from deportation and allow them to seek employment. But this measure applies only to those who arrived in the United States by March 1 and lasts only for 18 months (though that could be extended). He can also protect Ukrainian students in the United States by granting special student relief, which would make it easier for them to remain here. Further, he should grant parole status to newly arriving Ukrainian refugees, allowing them to remain in the United States.  The United States and European nations would do well to give Ukrainians unlimited access to job openings in their countries (without time limits). The United States in particular faces a labor shortage in many sectors that Ukrainian (and other) immigrants can help alleviate. Especially if the fighting in Ukraine continues for a long time or if Russia succeeds in occupying much of the country, many refugees will have to stay in the West indefinitely. In that event, access to employment will facilitate their assimilation to their new homes and enable them to make long-term contributions to our economies. To that end, the European Union would also do well to abolish or suspend its three-year limit on how long Ukrainian refugees can stay under its law.

There is only one country that might have the power to stop it now, and it’s not the United States. It’s China.  If China announced that, rather than staying neutral, it was joining the economic boycott of Russia — or even just strongly condemning its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and demanding that it withdraw — it might shake Vladimir Putin enough to stop this vicious war. At a minimum, it would give him pause, because he has no other significant ally aside from India in the world now.  Why would President Xi Jinping of China take such a stand, which would seemingly undermine his dream of seizing Taiwan the same way Putin is attempting to seize Ukraine? The short answer is that the past eight decades of relative peace among the great powers led to a rapidly globalizing world that has been the key to China’s rapid economic rise and the elevation out of poverty for some 800 million Chinese people since 1980. Peace has been very good for China. Its continued growth depends on China’s ability to export to and learn from that world of steadily integrating and modernizing free markets.  The whole Faustian bargain between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese citizenry — the C.C.P. gets to rule while the people get to be steadily better off economically — depends to a significant degree on the stability of the global economy and trading system.

Images of people living below ground to escape missile strikes, families trekking across borders, crying children — they are embedded in my mind. We are rightfully awed by the Ukrainian people’s resolve in the face of an unprovoked attack, a kind of resolve we see people all over the world have shown in the face of violence.  That human spirit is the reason I feel responsible not just for being informed but also for witnessing. It is easy to look away when the conflict feels remote, but bearing witness is the responsibility of being a citizen of a global superpower. I am also part of a community of people marked by others’ willful forgetting about the price we had to pay to win human dignity. That makes witnessing urgent. I do not want to do to others what is routinely done to us. I do not want to be the person who deals with human cruelty by ignoring it.  The desire to be informed witnesses leads some of us to “doomscrolling” — obsessively checking media feeds for the latest update. I am no exception. I recently found myself on my phone at 3 a.m. refreshing news feeds.    “Doomscrolling” is a new phenomenon, not just a new word for old behavior. Something has happened to make us obsessed with negative news. And research on doomscrolling suggests that this shift in the way we consume information is not ideologically dependent. People on all points of the spectrum from liberal to conservative are prone to doomscrolling. To me, the prime suspect is scale.  We have more information at our fingertips than ever before, and the scale is larger than our individual and collective capacity for sustained attention. How do we manage scale when the information at hand is both so plentiful and urgent? My colleagues often talk about media diets, or the mix of information sources we can reasonably take in. The word “diet” has a lot of negative connotations — deprivation, self-denial, exclusion and penance. But it might be useful to think about variety. When a major information event happens, it is worth checking your diet against other informed people’s.

These actions are beyond required sanctions, reflect public relations values and are inhumane.  It’s one thing for governments to be involved in the idiocy of war, but common everyday people need not be sanctioned so severely.  Andrew Ciofalo  Moscow  To the Editor:  I normally swim early on Sunday mornings. But today I couldn’t force myself to pack my pool bag and head out the door. I woke at dawn and watched the news. Harried reporters on MSNBC recounted the number of dead Ukrainian civilians and Russian soldiers. Images of bombed out homes and burning vehicles flashed across the TV screen.  Young women with pale, frightened faces huddled in cold basements cradling newborns as food supplies dwindled. Thousands of people trudged wearily toward an unknown future, clutching small bags. I thought: Here we go again. History repeating itself like a bad dream because of a crazy man.  I watched this tragedy from inside the safety of my home. I thought, why bother moving when a nuclear war might be right around the corner? I know this sounds horribly depressing, but my decision to stop the usual routine and remain motionless was actually quite life-affirming.  I needed time to stand still. I needed to hear the soft rain falling on my roof, and watch the red-breasted robins flying from tree to tree outside my window.  I needed time to pray for all the people and animals dying in Ukraine, and for the earth’s continuing survival. And so, on this day, knowing everyone and everything I love in life could vanish in the blink of an eye, I paused and gave thanks for the all that is.

Domestic copycats have followed suit: In the 2017 Doug Jones-Roy Moore U.S. Senate race in Alabama, Mr. Jones’s supporters — acting without his knowledge — posed on social media as Russian bots and Baptist alcohol abolitionists supporting Roy Moore in an effort to depress moderate Republican support for Mr. Moore. Mr. Jones, a Democrat, narrowly won that election, though we cannot say that the disinformation campaign swung the result.  The cheap speech environment increases polarization and the risk of demagogy by individual candidates. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who before entering Congress embraced dangerous QAnon conspiracy theories and supported the execution of Democratic politicians, need not depend upon party leaders for funding; by being outrageous, she can go right to social media to cheaply raise funds for her campaigns and political activities.  We now live in an era of high partisanship but weak political parties, which can no longer serve as the moderating influence on extremists within their ranks. Cheap speech accelerates this trend.  We cannot — and would not want to — go back to a time when media gatekeepers deprived voters of valuable information. Cheap speech helped fuel Black Lives Matters protests and the racial justice movement both before and after the murder of George Floyd, and virally spread videos of police misconduct can help catalyze meaningful change. But the cheap speech era requires new legal tools to shore up our democracy.  Among the legal changes that could help are an updating of campaign finance laws to cover what is now mostly unregulated political advertising disseminated over the internet, labeling deep fakes as “altered” to help voters separate fact from fiction and a tightening of the ban on foreign campaign expenditures. Congress should also make it a crime to lie about when, where and how people vote. A Trump supporter has been charged with targeting voters in 2016 with false messages suggesting that they could vote by text or social media post, but it is not clear if existing law makes such conduct illegal. We also need new laws aimed at limiting microtargeting, the use by campaigns or interest groups of intrusive data collected by social media companies to send political ads, including some misleading ones, sometimes to vulnerable populations.  Unfortunately, the current Supreme Court would very likely view many of these proposed legal changes as violating the First Amendment’s free speech guarantees. Much of the court’s jurisprudence depends upon faith in an outmoded “marketplace of ideas” metaphor, which assumes that the truth will emerge through counterspeech. If that was ever true in the past, it is not true in the cheap speech era. Today, the clearest danger to American democracy is not government censorship but the loss of voter confidence and competence that arises from the sea of disinformation and vitriol.  What’s worse, some justices on the court who otherwise fashion themselves as free speech libertarians have lately espoused positions that could exacerbate our problems. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, has indicated that he would most likely treat social media companies like telephone companies and allow states to pass laws requiring them not to deplatform politicians who violate the companies’ terms of use (as Facebook and Twitter did to Mr. Trump), even those who constantly spread election disinformation and encourage political violence. Justice Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch have also signaled an interest in loosening up libel laws, as Mr. Trump has urged, making it harder for legitimate journalists to expose or criticize the actions of politicians.

We are going to have to actively defend it against a sustained attempt to rewrite the rules by force and other tools, such as economic coercion. We must restore effective deterrence in Europe, where, for too long, the very success of NATO and of America’s security guarantee has bred complacency. What happens in Europe will have profound implications worldwide.  We are pleased to see more nations beginning to grasp this hard reality. In January, the United Kingdom was among a handful of European countries sending defensive aid to Ukraine. Now more than 20 countries are part of that effort. Defense spending is going up, though it will take time for that to translate into capability.  That’s a welcome development, but it is not going to be enough on its own to save Ukraine or keep the flame of freedom alive. Russia has overwhelming force and apparently no regard for the laws of war. We need to prepare now for even darker days ahead.  So we must begin a six-point plan for Ukraine, starting today.  First, we must mobilize an international humanitarian coalition. On Monday, I will meet the leaders of Canada and the Netherlands in London to talk about creating the widest possible coalition to expose the outrages that are taking place in Ukraine. On Tuesday, I will host the leaders of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, now on the front line of a refugee crisis. The United Kingdom has 1,000 troops on standby for humanitarian operations, on top of 220 million pounds ($291 million) of aid. We must all work together to establish an immediate cease-fire and allow civilians safe passage, food and medical supplies.  Second, we must do more to help Ukraine to defend itself. More and more nations are willing to provide defensive equipment. We must act quickly to coordinate our efforts to support the government of Ukraine.  Third, we must maximize the economic pressure on Mr. Putin’s regime. We must go further on economic sanctions, expelling every Russian bank from SWIFT and giving our law enforcement agencies unprecedented powers to peel back the facade of dirty Russian money in London. We must go after the oligarchs. So far, the United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on more than 300 elites and entities, including Mr. Putin himself. But these measures will be insufficient unless Europe begins to wean itself off the Russian oil and gas that bankroll Mr. Putin’s war machine.  Fourth, no matter how long it takes, we must prevent any creeping normalization of what Russia does in Ukraine. The lesson from Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and seizure of Crimea in 2014 is that accepting the results of Russian aggression merely encourages more aggression. We cannot allow the Kremlin to bite off chunks of an independent country and inflict immense human suffering and then creep back into the fold.

One simply said, “Go Home.”  That would have been difficult for Sveta Savchitz, who is 64 years old and moved here from Ukraine in 1993. More than 25 years later, when she and her son, Alan Aguichev, opened the restaurant, they decided to market it as Russian because they thought it would have more name recognition. “It’s very similar cuisine-wise,” Mr. Aguichev said. “The main difference is whoever is cooking the food.”  These days, there’s name recognition, but not in a good way. So last week, they changed all the language describing Sveta online from “Russian” to “Eastern European.”  Russian restaurants in New York City have a public relations problem. Even though many of the owners are openly against the war, or are even Ukrainian, they are getting burned by reservation cancellations, social media campaigns and bad Yelp reviews at a time when restaurants, in general, are still reeling from the shutdowns and restrictions of Covid-19. Some places have even been vandalized.

The United States organized a Pacific trade pact meant to counter China’s rise — and then refused to ratify that very pact, because of domestic politics. The U.S. also alienated longtime allies in Europe with Donald Trump’s “America First” policy. The European Union has been even more chaotic, with the departure of one of its biggest members, Britain.  China, all the while, has been strengthening its economic ties with countries around the world. Chinese leaders have been thrilled by the contrast between their own apparent competence and the West’s disorganization. It seemed to augur a new international order, in which China would compete with the U.S. for supremacy.  That scenario still seems likely. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated it. The war is arguably the most problematic international development for China in years.

Putin of Russia as effectively or persistently as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.  Mr. Zelensky’s defiant videos and speeches have inspired the West into action and, by his own account, made him a target for Russian assassins.  Before his life in politics, Mr. Zelensky was the star of a sitcom, “Servant of the People,” in which he played a Ukrainian president — a show that was also popular in Russia.  What is it about him and his rise to power that poses such a unique threat to Mr. Putin?

Failure to pass such a measure before this year had become a glaring example of the nation’s inadequate response to a crime that has long terrorized Black Americans. The N.A.A.C.P. estimated, based on its records, that Black victims accounted for 72 percent of 4,743 lynchings that occurred between 1882 and 1968.  “This is the year, now is the time, that we do the right thing,” said Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina and a longtime champion of the legislation, in an impassioned speech on the Senate floor on Thursday. “Not for Republicans or Democrats, but for Americans who’ve watched, with bewildered eyes and confused hearts, their government fall short on issues of importance to them again and again and again. Let this year be the year we put politics to the side and we get it done.”  Representative George Henry White of North Carolina first introduced legislation to make lynching a hate crime in 1900; he was the only Black lawmaker in Congress at the time. The bill never made it to the House floor for a vote. In the years since, more than 200 similar bills have been filed, lawmakers estimated.  In 2005, the Senate formally apologized for its failure to act on the issue, including when Southern senators blocked similar legislation during the Jim Crow era. More than a decade later, three Black senators — Mr. Scott, Mr. Booker and Kamala Harris of California — began a renewed effort to see an anti-lynching measure signed into law.

The former governor of New York spoke at a Black church on Sunday, days after releasing a political ad. What might be next in Mr. Cuomo’s re-entry into public life?  Image Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo spoke at God’s Battalion of Prayer Church in Brooklyn on Sunday, in his first public appearance since his resignation. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times  Published March 7, 2022 Updated March 7, 2022  Seven months after former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo resigned in disgrace amid accusations of sexual harassment and the threat of impeachment, he is now moving aggressively to chart a path back to public life.  He is still out of a job and still politically isolated, following one of the most stunning collapses in modern American political history.  But in recent weeks, his campaign account has funded advertising that casts him as the victim of politically motivated “attacks.” He inveighed against “cancel culture” during an appearance at a Black church in Brooklyn on Sunday. And he has made headlines for dining with prominent figures including former Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, and Mayor Eric Adams of New York City.  “Perhaps someone testing the waters,” former Gov. David A. Paterson, Democrat of New York, observed.  The question animating New York political circles: testing the waters for what?  While he has some loyal supporters, many formerly close allies have said they do not see space in public life for Mr. Cuomo. He chose to resign last summer amid swirling investigations and the prospect of an impeachment trial after allies in state and national Democratic circles, including President Biden, abandoned him. His legal issues are not entirely resolved, and a recent poll from Siena College Research Institute found that 80 percent of New York voters said resigning was the appropriate step.  “There is absolutely no future for Andrew Cuomo in public life in New York State or anywhere else,” said Christine Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council who was once a close Cuomo ally. But, she said, “the mind of a harasser and an assaulter is the mind of a narcissist. So he probably thinks he can be president of the United States.”  Mr. Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately or making sexual advances and has been buoyed by the fact that several district attorneys did not press charges against him after investigating some of the claims of misconduct. But while prosecutors concluded there were insufficient legal grounds to pursue criminal charges, a number of them also stressed that they had found the claims credible.  As he continues his march back into the public eye, here are five possible scenarios for Mr. Cuomo and their significant attendant challenges, based on interviews with New York Democratic strategists, officials and Cuomo associates.

Flag Foolery  At a Republican fund-raiser on Saturday, Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. should paint Chinese flags on F-22 jets and bomb Russia.  “Look, we came very close, very close to a world where Trump was still in charge during Russia’s brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine, which is scary for many reasons,” Seth Meyers said on Monday. “One of which is Trump keeps giving us a glimpse as to how he would have responded, and, as usual, he has that unique Trump blend of being both terrifying and incredibly stupid at the same time.”

It is a deep, seething bitterness for President Vladimir V. Putin, his military and his government. But Ukrainians are not giving a pass to ordinary Russians, either, calling them complicit through years of political passivity. The hatred is vented by mothers in bomb shelters, by volunteers preparing to fight on the front lines, by intellectuals and by artists.  The emotion is so powerful it could not be assuaged even by an Orthodox religious holiday on Sunday intended to foster forgiveness before Lent. Called Forgiveness Sunday, the holiday is recognized in both the Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox churches.

The night before the riot Mr. Jones was at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, where Trump aides and allies had set up an outpost. He has longtime ties to at least a half-dozen people arrested after the riot, including the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, Stewart Rhodes, still a regular guest on Infowars, and Joseph Biggs, a former Infowars employee and Proud Boys leader.  The House committee has subpoenaed Mr. Jones, and included a three-page list seeking his related communications and financial records. The panel is also seeking Mr. Jones’s communications with Mr. Trump, his family and anyone from the White House or Congress in the days before the riot. Questioned by the panel this year, Mr. Jones invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times, and is trying to block the committee’s demand for records in court.  Whatever the outcome of the Jan. 6 investigation, Mr. Jones’s journey from Sandy Hook to the assault on the Capitol is a reflection of how conspiracy theories in the United States have metastasized and corroded public discourse in the digital age. A defender of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a former regular on RT, the Kremlin-funded international television outlet, Mr. Jones espoused such extreme views of American democratic society — he has cast airport security screenings as a plot to usurp Americans’ freedoms — that in 2011 RT stopped inviting him on air.  But after Mr. Trump appeared live in an interview on Infowars’ website in December 2015, Mr. Jones traveled from the fringes to become part of a newly radicalized Republican Party. Infowars grossed more than $50 million annually during the Trump presidency by selling diet supplements, body armor and other products on its website, records filed in court indicate. During and after the Jan. 6 riot, Infowars promoted its merchandise alongside graphic videos, including footage by an Infowars cameraman of the shooting death of a pro-Trump rioter, Ashli Babbitt, by a Capitol Police officer during the attack.  Mr. Jones did not respond to messages seeking comment. His lawyer, Norm Pattis, said his client had done nothing wrong on Jan. 6. Video footage from the Capitol that day shows Mr. Jones using a bullhorn to try to discourage people from rioting.

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

He tried several times but the line was engaged.  “I don’t know why the embassy didn’t tell us the war was going to break out when other countries advised their citizens to leave days before,” he said. Yang – not his real name - then followed his university’s emergency protocols and took refuge in a bomb shelter. Days later an escape route began to circulate among his friends. He decided to follow the instruction and flee on his own.  Almost two weeks before Russia acted – described by the Chinese media as “special military operations” – countries including the UK and Canada advised their nationals to leave Ukraine. But in the case of China, which had nearly 6,000 nationals in the country, it was not until the day after the war broke out that the embassy advised its citizens to leave.  “By the time they knew [the war was to break out], it was already too late to evacuate,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China programme at the Stimson Center in Washington. Until the war broke out, many high-profile Chinese pundits and news outlets had insisted western prediction of an invasion was “fake news”.

People in the southern port city, which could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea if captured, are not only suffering bombardment but have had no heat, water, sanitary systems or phones since Friday.  Buses were set to deliver humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, then pick up civilians to take them to a safe place but soon after officials announced the vehicles were en route, the Ukrainian president’s office said it had been informed of shelling on the corridor. It is unclear whether the supply convoy made it to Mariupol or whether civilians will freely board the buses if the shelling continues.  Buses earlier began leaving two devastated Ukrainian cities as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Ukraine was running out of vital medical supplies.  The Ukrainian state communications agency posted video of people with bags and suitcases fleeing the north-eastern city of Sumy, 30 miles (50km) from the Russian border, along one of five “humanitarian corridors” promised by the invading forces.  “Sumy was given a green corridor, the first stage of evacuation began,” the agency tweeted. The governor of the Kyiv region also said civilians were being evacuated from Irpin, near the capital, with more than 150 having left the town on Tuesday.  There was no certainty, however, how long the evacuations would last. Previous efforts were abandoned after Russian forces continued to bombard residential areas, and civilians trying to take the routes to safety themselves came under fire.  Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned that the Russian side was “preparing to disrupt the work of humanitarian corridors” and a spokesperson for the presidency in Kyiv said success would depend on how long the routes remained safe.  There was also disagreement about what routes had been agreed. Moscow said its troops would enter “silent regime” from 10am local time to allow corridors out of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, mostly leading to Russia or Belarus.  Vereshchuk, however, suggested only a route out of Sumy leading to Ukrainian city of Poltava had been agreed, and reiterated the Kyiv government’s position that any evacuation routes leading to Russia or its ally Belarus were unacceptable.  01:21 People flee as humanitarian corridor opened in parts of Ukraine to escape Russian onslaught – video  Demand for safe routes out of Ukraine’s battered population centres has increased rapidly as Russia has intensified its missile attacks and heavy artillery shelling of residential areas, creating a humanitarian crisis of fast-dwindling food, water and medical supplies.  In Mariupol an estimated 200,000 people – nearly half the city’s population – are waiting to flee, with Red Cross officials awaiting news on a safe corridor out.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday a child had died from dehydration in the city. “In 2022, from dehydration,” Zelenskiy said in a video address, likening Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis to that created by the Nazi invasion during the second world war.  Further ceasefire talks between the two sides are expected in the coming days but after a third round failed on Monday, negotiators warned not to expect subsequent efforts to bring any rapid breakthroughs. The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are expected to meet in Turkey on Thursday.  The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Tuesday that the number of people who had fled Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February had reached 2 million. Poland said on Tuesday it had welcomed about 1.2 million people, including 141,500 on Monday alone.  The Romanian government said 291,081 Ukrainians have crossed its border since the start of the conflict, while the EU’s top diplomat warned that as many as 5 million Ukrainians could flee the country if the invasion continues.  Grandi said that after the first exodus, a second would follow consisting of more vulnerable refugees. “If the war continues we will start seeing people that have no resources and no connections,” he said.  “That will be a more complex situation to manage for European countries going forward, and there will need to be even more solidarity by everybody in Europe and beyond,” he added.  The WHO on Tuesday said attacks on hospitals, ambulances and other healthcare facilities in Ukraine had surged, with at least at least nine people dying in 16 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the invasion, and warned the country was running short of vital medical supplies such as oxygen, insulin, personal protective equipment, surgical supplies and blood products.  The WHO’s Europe director, Hans Kluge, said the agency was particularly concerned about the health needs of women, including maternal health and emergency obstetric care. “Past conflicts have shown us that adolescent girls, women with disabilities and elderly women are in the most vulnerable situation,” he said.  Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov and establish a land corridor to Crimea. Elsewhere, however, progress has become stalled, including a long military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv.  Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers have fortified the capital with checkpoints and barricades designed to block a takeover of the city of nearly 4 million people, using sandbags, stacked tires and spiked cables. “Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary,” said the mayor, Vitali Klitschko.  Ukraine said on Tuesday its forces had killed more than 12,000 Russian troops since the start of the conflict as well as destroying 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 1,036 armed vehicles, 120 artillery pieces and 27 anti-aircraft warfare systems. Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 of its soldiers dead.  Ukraine’s intelligence service on Monday claimed its forces had killed a second senior Russian army commander, saying Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, had been killed outside Kharkiv.  Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces were showing exceptional courage. “The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” he told ABC News in an interview on Monday night.  Zelenskiy will address British MPs via video link on Tuesday, the first time a president of another country has addressed the House of Commons. Formal parliamentary business will be suspended and MPs will be given headsets for simultaneous translation  The British defence minister, Ben Wallace, said on Tuesday the UK would support Poland if it decided to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, but warned it could bring the country “into direct line of fire”.  As western governments have moved to isolate Moscow diplomatically and economically, Moscow stoked fears of an energy war by threatening to close a major gas pipeline to Germany after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine.  In an address on Russian state television, the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said on Monday night: “A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,” and claimed the price of oil could rise to more than $300 a barrel.  Novak’s comments followed remarks by the European Commission’s climate policy chief, Frans Timmermans, who said the EU could wean itself off Russian gas – which accounts for about 40% of Europe’s supply – within years and start curbing its reliance within months.  The commission is due to propose plans on Tuesday to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy.

The footage, first posted by Radio Free Europe (RFE) on Monday, showed a fiery exchange between Sergei Tsivilyov, the governor of the Kemerovo region, and people in the city of Novokuznetsk.  “They lied to everyone, they deceived everyone … Why did you send them there?” one woman asks Tsivilyov, saying that the soldiers thought they were going for military drills in Belarus.  “They didn’t know their objective … They were sent as cannon fodder,” the woman adds.  The governor would not have been responsible for the decision to deploy the unit, which would have been made by the country’s national guard, a separate internal military force directly subordinated to the president, Vladimir Putin.  According to RFE, the confrontation took place on Saturday at the gymnasium of the training base for riot police units, some of whose officers were killed or captured in Ukraine.  As the fighting in Ukraine nears its third week, more and more relatives of killed and captured Russian soldiers have expressed their opposition to the war, saying their loved ones were not told in advance about the country’s plans to invade Ukraine. Videos of captured Russian soldiers issued by the Ukrainians also appear to show that Russian troops were not informed of the invasion until the very end.  Western military experts have raised questions about Russian troops’ morale and preparedness in Ukraine, which could explain why Moscow’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine and take Kyiv has so far failed.  Russia has revealed very little information about the state of its soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Last week, Russia’s defence ministry said that 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military claimed on Sunday that more than 11,000 Russian troops had been killed since the invasion of Ukraine began.  In the video, Tsivilyov defended the invasion, saying that Russia’s actions in Ukraine “shouldn’t be criticised”.  “Look, you can shout and blame everyone right now, but I think that, while a military operation is in process, one shouldn’t make any conclusions,” Tsivilyov said.  Russian officials, as well as state media, have been referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” rather than a “war” or “invasion”.  Authorities have also introduced a number of new laws aimed at stifling public opposition to the war.  On Friday, Putin signed into law a bill that introduced jail terms of up to 15 years for fake news about the Russian army, forcing many Russian and international outlets to cease their coverage of the events.  And while the authorities have been successful at getting a large segment of the population behind its war efforts, videos such as the Novokuznetsk footage circulating online suggest the war is deeply unpopular among those who have lost friends and relatives in Ukraine.  The Guardian previously spoke to family members of a Russian sniper captured in Ukraine, who similarly expressed anger and shock about their relative’s involvement in the war.  “Young boys are thrown like cannon fodder, and most importantly for what? For palaces in Gelendzhik?” the close family member of the captured sniper Leonid Paktishev said, referring to the palatial mansion on the Black Sea that Russian independent journalists have said is linked to Putin.

In a series of incidents in recent days, civilian deaths have been reported from the town of Makariv outside Kyiv – also the location of the deadly bombing of a bakery on Monday in which 13 people died – and on a minibus carrying teachers to an orphanage in the southern city of Mykolaiv.  Video circulating on Ukrainian Telegram channels on Tuesday claimed to show footage of civilians being killed in Makariv.  In the video a car, travelling by what appears to be a security camera mounted on a wall, is seen first driving into shot and then immediately stopping when the occupants, said to be an elderly couple, see a Russian BMP armoured vehicle approaching the crossroads ahead of them at speed.  With the civilian car at a halt the Russian armoured car takes a slight turn at the junction and, still moving, fires two rounds from a heavy calibre weapon at the vehicle, destroying it. The armoured car pauses for a moment then turns to disappear across the junction followed by other armoured vehicles that come into view.  In the second incident reported on Tuesday, the head of Mykolaiv’s regional council, Anna Zamazeeva – a city currently under Russian attack – claimed three teachers who had been travelling by minibus to an orphanage for a shift change had been killed and two others wounded when their vehicle, marked with a red cross, came under fire.  The latest two incidents come on top of the widely reported case of Anastasiia Yalanskaya, 26, who was shot and killed in her car by Russian forces after delivering food to a dog shelter outside Kyiv.  Yalanskaya, who had posted details of her plans to deliver food to the shelter, was one of three volunteers who travelled to Bucha, 18 miles (29km) outside of Kyiv.  A few days before, Yalanskaya had detailed another trip to deliver aid to a nursery near Kyiv. “Blown up bridges and roads are terrible, houses destroyed by rockets, it’s monstrous,” she wrote. “If there is a sign [that says] ‘do not slow down’, you must obey.”

The office said the victims had been killed in an airstrike on a residential street, adding that the bodies were being recovered by emergency services and search operations were continuing.  01:21 People flee as humanitarian corridor opened in parts of Ukraine to escape Russian onslaught – video  The region’s military administration chief said Sumy was enduring an “unequal battle” and “the kids are being killed” by bombs from Russian planes.  “After 23 hours, Russian enemy planes dropped air bombs on the city and district,” Dmytro Zhyvytskyi wrote on Facebook. “Potraplânâ in the residential quarters of the city of Sumy destroyed and houses damaged and people injured. There are dead and injured. Rescuers are working in places. Among the victims are children.”  Zhyvytskyi added: “What rules can there be when the Russian army kills, destroys, drops bombs on civilian population?! The kids are being killed.”  At 9.30am local time people began boarding buses out of Sumy – the first evacuation from a Ukrainian city through a humanitarian corridor agreed with Russia after several failed attempts in recent days.  Zhivitskiy said in a video statement that buses were heading west for the city of Poltava. He said priority would be given to people with disabilities, pregnant women and children in orphanages. Sumy lies just 30 miles from the Russian border.  Residents were also leaving the town of Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb where Reuters journalists had filmed families fleeing under fierce bombardment on Sunday.  “As of 09:30 (0730 GMT), more than 150 people have been evacuated and (evacuation) activities are under way,” said Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of the Kyiv region.  Residents ran with their young children in buggies or cradling babies in arms, while others carried pets and plastic bags of belongings.  “The city is almost ruined, and the district where I’m living, it’s like there are no houses which were not bombed,” said one young mother, holding a baby beneath a blanket while her daughter stood by her side.  “Yesterday was the hardest bombing, and the lights and sound is so scary, and the whole building is shaking.”  Reuters contributed to this report

The move comes as a response to pressure from US lawmakers. As recently as Sunday, the Biden administration appeared not to be in favour of a move critics of Russia say is be the best – perhaps only – way to force Moscow to pull back.  The White House said Biden would announce “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine”.  According to the US Energy Information Administration, Russian oil made up about 3% of all crude shipments to the US last year – a far lighter dependence than among European US allies.  Overall, Russian oil and petroleum products represented about 8% of US oil imports.  On the markets, crude oil futures extended gains on news of the impending ban, rising 4% to $124.21 in New York.  The ban will include oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, according to Biden administration officials. The decision was reportedly made in consultation with European allies.  Natural gas from Russia accounts for one-third of Europe’s consumption of the fossil fuel. The US does not import Russian natural gas.  The move follows pleas by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to US and western officials to cut off the imports, which had been a glaring omission to massive sanctions put in place over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady influx of cash flowing to Russia, despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.  Biden explained his reluctance to impose energy sanctions at the outset of the conflict two weeks ago, saying he was trying “to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump”.  News of his decision to ban oil imports was first reported by Bloomberg.  Before the invasion, Russian oil and gas made up more than a third of government revenues. Global energy prices have surged since the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves, making Russian exports even more lucrative.  The US and international partners have sanctioned Russia’s largest banks, its central bank and finance ministry, and moved to block certain financial institutions from the Swift messaging system for international payments.  But the rules issued by the US treasury department allow Russian energy transactions to keep going through non-sanctioned banks that are not based in the US in an effort to minimize any disruptions to the global energy markets.  Inflation, at a 40-year peak and fueled in large part by gas prices, has hurt Biden politically heading into the November elections. The invasion of Ukraine has potentially worsened supply chain problems and inflation.  Biden previously highlighted Russian energy carve-outs because they would help protect US families and businesses from higher prices.  “Our sanctions package we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue,” he said.  Restricting the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and second-largest exporter of oil, after Saudi Arabia, could hurt the unity US officials say is key to confronting Putin.

No 10 was expected to make an announcement at 4pm, the day after Boris Johnson said western nations would need a “step-by-step transition period” away from Russian hydrocarbons.  Johnson has indicated he wants to move with international partners in the west on phasing out Russian oil, with cargoes already being turned away from British ports.  Ministers are also looking at how to reduce the UK’s gas from Russia down from 4% to 0% as part of its forthcoming energy strategy, which was due this week but may be delayed until next week.  Any move to ban Russian oil imports is likely to be brought in over several months, with the government stressing that people should not panic buy fuel.

The companies have been criticised for their failure to speak out about the invasion, and for continuing to operate in Russia, while a host of other firms such as Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry and Ikea have halted business in the country.  #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola have been trending on Twitter since the weekend. Other western food and drink chains including Starbucks, KFC and Burger King are also still operating in Russia.  Sean Penn, the American actor and film-maker, urged Americans on Twitter to boycott Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and McDonald’s until the companies suspend their operations in Russia. Core Response, the non-profit group he founded in 2010 in response to the Haiti earthquake, is on the ground in Poland helping Ukrainian refugees.  Sean Penn (@SeanPenn) Until Coca-Cola, PepsiCo & McDonalds suspend business in Russia, American citizens have a very safe & simple way to stand with Ukraine.

Evacuated from Kabul after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, she was now fleeing another country in another continent, this time to escape Russian bombs and bullets.  A software engineer and data analyst, 23-year-old Tajik says the shock and trauma of finding herself in another war zone has shaken her sense of reality.  “Sometimes, when I close my eyes, everything seems surreal,” she says, from the Polish capital Warsaw where she has finally found a place of relative safety. “When I was on my way to the Polish border from Lviv, I saw scenes which took me back to my evacuation in Kabul. Every time I saw these scenes, I felt deja vu. I had the feeling I had lived through this before. I couldn’t believe that. I left my family and friends in Afghanistan a few months before, and I was now leaving my friends in Ukraine.”  Masouma Tajik: ‘This time, I will live each day as it comes.’ Photograph: Alessio Mamo  War and conflict have followed her since birth. She was born a refugee in Tehran, after her family, who are Hazara, an ethnic minority persecuted in Afghanistan, were forced to leave their home. After the family returned, and despite all the obstacles stacked against her because of her gender and ethnicity, she managed to win a scholarship to the American University of Afghanistan and became one of the top students in her class.  Last August, Tajik was studying and living in Kabul when the Taliban arrived at the gates of the city on 14 August. Within 24 hours, thousands of Afghans who once felt protected by the Afghan National Army and the US military found themselves living under Taliban law.  As a Hazara and a professional woman, Tajik was a target. “My boss called me to tell me that I had to leave the city and that he had found a way to get us out,” she says. Along with thousands of other desperate Afghans she managed to make it to Kabul airport where a chaotic evacuation effort was under way.  If I have learned one thing from these six months, it is that we really do not know what tomorrow has in store for us Masouma Tajik  “When we entered the airport, the situation was getting worse. The case was dire, with the Taliban beating people on the run. I was whipped by a group of Taliban. I was terrified.”  After days of waiting, on 21 August, Tajik, carrying only a backpack containing a laptop and Elif Shafak’s book The Forty Rules of Love, managed to find a seat on a plane bound for Kyiv.  Alone in a strange city with a different language and living as a refugee, she began to try to rebuild her life. “After a few months, I found myself jobless because the company I worked for was closing down,” she says. “But I didn’t give up and got another remote job as a data analyst for a Serbian company.”  Six months later, as Tajik was starting to make friends, her life imploded without warning, once more. On 24 February, Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine and head for Kyiv, which was hit by the first airstrikes soon after. For Tajik, it was time to escape again.  “I started to think, is there any country where there is no war, so I can go there?” says Tajik, with tears running down her face. “And why, among all the people in the world, why me? Why can’t I just have a normal life like that of any other 23-year-old girl in Europe?”  0 ‘I’m pregnant, I left my husband behind’: the people forced to flee Putin's war in Ukraine - video  Tajik managed to reach Lviv where she got in touch with a group of Polish volunteers on Facebook, who crossed the border into Ukraine to bring her to safety in Poland.  “Before leaving, I wasn’t eating and drinking just to save the little money I had – in order to save myself,” she says.  Tajik arrived in Warsaw last Thursday and was reunited with an Afghan friend from Kabul who has been living in Poland since the Taliban takeover. She now faces the prospect of having to start her life over again for the third time.  “This time, I will live each day as it comes,” she says. “Because if I have learned one thing from life in these six months, it is that we really do not know what tomorrow has in store for us.”  Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:

Her feminist protest art has been deadly serious since its inception, when she founded Pussy Riot in 2011. The watching world may have been entertained by its playful notes, the guerrilla gigs in unauthorised places, culminating in the event for which she was prosecuted, in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, when she sang Punk Prayer: Mother of God, Drive Putin Away.  But the consequences have always been seismic and severe. Tolokonnikova, along with two other members of Pussy Riot, were sentenced to two years in prison for hooliganism in 2012, separated from their very young children, went on hunger strike, endured unimaginably harsh conditions and were named prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International.  Tolokonnikova is “nomadic by nature”, she says. “This planet is my home. I’ve always been an anarchist. I’m not really a big fan of borders or nation states.” But beneath those abstracts there exist concrete dangers. She was declared a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin in December, as was the independent news outlet she founded upon her release from prison, Mediazone.  Sentenced to two years … Pussy Riot perform inside Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Photograph: ITAR-TASS News Agency/Alamy  “Putin just signed a law that said you’re going to get 15 years in jail for even discussing the war in Ukraine,” she says matter-of-factly. “You cannot even call it a war, you have to call it a special military operation.” The jeopardy of being a known Russian dissident is greater now than it has been in decades, and nobody understands that more keenly than Tolokonnikova, who was born in 1989, too young to remember Perestroika.  Yet her focus is anything but self-protective. When Putin invaded Ukraine on 24 February, she and various collaborators from the world of cryptocurrency launched the Ukraine DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). It was a 1/1 NFT of the Ukrainian flag, and the group invited people to bid for collective ownership of the image, raising $7.1m in five days.  “We felt, me and my friends in crypto, that we had to react somehow. I’m personally convinced that in situations like this, activism is the only thing that can keep you sane. Just looking at disasters and tragedies and not doing anything about it is really detrimental for the world, but also it slowly destroys you and makes you feel helpless.” The money has already been distributed to the organisation Come Back Alive, which has been mobilising support for the Ukrainian army since 2014 with medical care, ammunition, training and defence analytics.  I was ready to die. If you fight with a dictator, you have to show them that you are ready to fight to the end  Tolokonnikova is devastated by the invasion of Ukraine. “I’m in a panic, I’m crying every day. I don’t think it was in any sense necessary, I don’t think it was in any sense logical. It wasn’t something that had to happen, it’s a disaster that will end thousands of people’s lives. I’m freaking out.” Yet she never had the luxury of complacency about what Putin was capable of. “The global community was extremely complacent, and I see two reasons: hypocrisy, based on greed. People would make statements that they did not support Putin’s politics, and his oppression of the political opposition, and the wars that he started – this isn’t the first war by any means. But at the same time they would continue doing business with him.” Nobody was interested in following the money; asking how the oligarchs coming out of Russia, fetching up in Europe and Miami, had come upon their vast wealth.  “Stupidity,” she continues, bluntly: “this is the second reason. People underestimate how dangerous dictators are. In 2014, we spoke to the UK parliament, we spoke at the Senate in the US, we were asked by a lot of people how they should talk to Putin, how they should frame the conversation, and I always advised that they should be as strict as they could. You cannot play nice with Putin.” This wisdom was won, not so much by her arrest for offending the thin-skinned leader but during her time in prison. “Dictators act a lot like prison wardens. They treat kindness as weakness.”  ‘I think Putin is digging his own grave’ … Tolokonnikova performing at the Women’s March and Rally for Abortion Justice in Texas last year. Photograph: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty Images  Both during her sentence and following her release in 2014, Tolokonnikova campaigned in ways that political prisoners throughout history would recognise. First, with a hunger strike. “Starting that, I was pretty much ready to die. If you fight with a dictator, you have to show them that you are ready to fight to the end. I think this is why Ukraine is actually winning: they might lose some cities but they’re willing to fight to the end, and that is not the case for the Russian army.”  She gained support worldwide, and from figures such as Madonna and Hillary Clinton. She began to exchange letters with Slavoj Žižek which were subsequently turned into a book, Comradely Greetings. What she remembers now, though, was the concrete impact on prison conditions. A week into her hunger strike, Putin’s right-hand man on human rights called her personally, in prison, to discuss the brutal conditions she was protesting against: 18 hour days of labour with only one day off every six weeks; very little sleep; horrific violence at the hands of guards and other inmates.  “This was fairly insane. I was the lowest person on the social ladder, and he had to call me.” Later, the prison director and architect of this slave labour system, Yury Kupriyanov, was convicted for it and served a suspended two-year sentence, and the Russian correctional headquarters “had to make a statement. They named me, and said I was right.”  Everything I’m doing is to be a greater pain in the arse to Putin  Tolokonnikova’s sentence left its mark: “I was traumatised by prison. I was barely functional when I got released. I suffered from a really severe depression in 2014. I’m still on medication for depression caused by PTSD.” The daughter from whom she was separated by incarceration is now 14; “she’s a social democrat,” Tolokonnikova says approvingly, if a bit wryly. “She says that in her generation, people want greater equality.”  Her experience hasn’t blunted her activism, which is now concentrated at the frontier of technological possibility. She originally thought cryptocurrencies were just a toy for rich techies but their potential for activists – being independent of central banks and governments, immune to corporate takeover – dawned on her in early 2021, and since that time she has raised: “quite substantial sums for different charitable causes. We raised money for a shelter for victims of domestic violence. We were able to move dozens of women from a really dangerous place in Russia, outside of Russia. We raised money in August of last year for political prisoners in Russia.”  Besides that, today she is helping launch the UnicornDAO, a crypto fund whose mission is to buy artworks from female and LGBTQ+ artists. “It’s not going to be just buying up their works of art; we’re going to be working with them, helping them in various ways to have stable and sustainable careers.” Unicorn’s first purchase was by the Russian-born, New York-based artist Olive Allen.  Detained … the band at a court hearing in Moscow in 2012. Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images  “I feel like the NFT world is a great way to redistribute money,” Tolokonnikova says, “but we see these old patterns being repeated. Misogyny doesn’t go anywhere, it just migrates over to digital artwork. Women account for only five per cent of all NFT sales. It’s so much more difficult to prove there is value in your words if you happen to be a woman.”  These explorations in crypto can sound mercurial, one minute driving cultural change, the next raising money, the next trying to create democratic agency independent of nation states – and it’s by no means clear what that would look like – but Tolokonnikova’s reading of Russian politics, and what it would take to force change, is entirely practical. It would take “a mass uprising, millions of people coming to the streets and refusing to leave until Putin is gone. That is obviously incredibly dangerous. Putin is insane, so he might open fire at his own people. I definitely understand why everybody is not already on the streets.”  Alongside that, “another force of change may come from Putin’s closet circle. I honestly think Putin is digging his own grave now. The number of oligarchs who are close to him who have publicly supported Ukraine, and are standing against the war, is significant, and that hasn’t happened in 20 years.”  She sees a worthy successor to Putin in opposition leader Alexei Navalny. “Better social programmes, and redistribution, that’s all part of his programme. I’ve known him since 2007 – it has been really interesting to witness his platform become more and more social democratic, even though he doesn’t describe himself as that. He doesn’t use labels. I think it’s smart. He doesn’t want to divide people.” And as she recalls her own time in prison, Tolokonnikova urges the world not to forget that Navalny still languishes in jail. Her own work, specifically the UnicornDAO, “is not connected to Putin directly anyhow. But everything I’m doing is to be a greater pain in the arse to Putin, because it’s so personal to me.”

The contrasts between the southern and northern fronts are likely to have profound consequences, weighing heavily on any future peace negotiations, with likely effects that are economic, diplomatic and political as well as military.  Nature has fortified Mykolaiv. Built on a series of looping river bends where the Southern Bug empties into a large inlet of the Black Sea, the shipbuilding centre forms the apex triangle of key ports with Kherson to the east and Odesa to the west.  Easier to defend than to attack, in the days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine reached its outskirts, there have been pitched battles as the city’s airport has changed hands, and as the city’s defenders have manned their barricades, smoke curling above the river from Russian strikes.  So far Mykolaiv has held out under the leadership of its charismatic governor, Vitaliy Kim, whose updates on social media have rivalled those of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in their cheerful insouciance.  But on Tuesday it appeared Russian forces were looking to bypass the city to the north and find another way across the river. The attempt to skirt Mykolaiv and move on to link up a land bridge with Russian “peacekeeping” forces in the breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova would cut off Ukraine’s most important port, Odesa, by both land and sea.  An update from the Institute for the Study of War paints the most recent picture of Russia’s ambitions in the south. “Russian troops are likely attempting to bypass Mykolaiv and cross the Southern Bug upriver of that city to permit an advance on Odesa that will combine with an impending amphibious operation against that city … and are driving north from Crimea toward the city of Zaporizhzhia.”  The importance of what has been happening in the south was described by the recently retired Australian general and author Mick Ryan in a long Twitter thread.  “The southern theatre of the war is a vital element of the overall Russian campaign design for Ukraine,” wrote Ryan. “[It] contains Ukraine’s 13 seaports, which in 2021 exported over 150 million tons of cargo. This represents 60% of exports & 50% of imports for Ukraine.  A residential building in Mykolaiv damaged by shelling. Photograph: Ukraine State Emergency Service/Reuters  “And while the war in the north and east has settled into a slow moving and grinding war of attrition, the war in the south has been the location of more operational success for the invading Russian forces.”  Ryan identifies a number of issues to explain why the Russian campaign has been more successful in the south. They include “a significant overmatch of Russian ground forces in the south” compared with Ukrainian forces, overstretched Ukrainian defences across the country, and the fact it is logistically easier to resupply troops from established Russian bases in the Rostov-Krasnodar region over the border.  “Why have the Russians in the south generally been more successful than those in the north-east and north?” wrote Ryan. “The defence of Kyiv is the strategic main effort for Ukraine. It is their capital, and has significant political, logistic, and cultural value.”  “Finally,” he added, “and this is purely speculation, the leadership and campaign planning in the south appears to be superior to the north. While often advancing on diverging axes, the southern theatre has largely continued without the long pauses seen in the north and north-east.”  While the fall of Kyiv – or its negotiated capitulation – is a key Russian war aim, a limited Russian victory in the south alone would still have massive implications for Ukraine. As well as creating a devastating economic stranglehold on the country, it would also limit any western aid flows into Ukraine, while threatening the country’s integrity from three broad geographical directions with Russia likely to claim southern areas it has control of in any future peace negotiations.  Most worrying of all for Ukraine, perhaps, is what control of the south would mean for the war in other parts of the country, with fears that Russian forces could link up with Russians operating south of Kharkiv or ultimately breakout north towards Dnipro, the key strategic city on the Dnieper River.  In the north the Russian offensive remained more complex on Tuesday. While some analysts and western intelligence agencies have described the Russian advance in the north as “stalled” there has also been evidence since the weekend of preparations for a renewed assault on Kyiv and regrouping of Russian forces around the capital city, including attempts – opposed by Ukrainian forces – to advance west towards Kyiv from the direction of Sumy.  Russian forces have also hit a number of key logistics centres and an air defence centre that could support Kyiv’s defence, including the Vinnytsia airbase, which it hit with eight cruise missiles, as well as a number of fuel depots.  In outlying areas of Kyiv such as Bucha and Irpen, close to the biggest concentration of gathering Russian forces, residents have been forced to flee under a steady rain of shells and rockets.  “We can’t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn’t stop day or night,” said the mayor, Anatol Fedoruk. “Dogs are pulling apart the bodies on the city streets. It’s a nightmare.”  Through it all, Zelenskiy said, Ukrainian forces were showing unprecedented courage.“The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” he told ABC News in an interview that aired Monday night.  But he noted that the gap in strength was closing and that even if Russian forces “come into all our cities”, they will be met with an insurgency.  One of the most pessimistic commentators on Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s attack against it has been Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, who reflected part of that message. “The fundamental problem the Ukrainian military faced from the very beginning,” he wrote this week, “is that it doesn’t have enough forces to defend everything at once.  “The Russians have a numerical advantage and are willing to trade soldiers and hardware to achieve its objectives.”

The Russian invasion has already turned the khaki-wearing Ukrainian leader into the most powerful – and effective – political communicator in the world. The addresses from his office in Kyiv are designed to shift political and public opinion, and they have already had a dramatic impact.  A private speech to EU leaders a few days earlier is credited with helping bring forward tougher than expected sanctions on Russia from Brussels. In that address he told the gathered presidents and prime ministers he believed his life was under threat, and from their relative safety in the Belgian capital the continent’s leading politicians felt they had little choice but to step up.  Zelenskiy may have got his tough sanctions but they have not turned the tide in the war. Despite a chaotic and messy start, Russian forces continue to menace Kyiv and analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believe the start of attack on the capital could be 24 to 96 hours away.  What the Ukrainians want immediately is greater military support from the west, as demonstrated by another speech from the president – a private video address made to 280 members of the US Congress on Saturday. One of those listening was Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who said Zelenskiy “made a desperate plea” for the implementation of a no-fly zone – or failing that more fighter planes and other advanced military aid.  01:09 'Not afraid of anyone': Zelenskiy says he will stay in Kyiv until war is won – video  Ukrainian officials told the Guardian he is expected to make similar remarks to the House of Commons on Tuesday (although his speeches tend to be extemporised, so it is hard to be certain: “I don’t read off the paper off this sheet because the paper phase in the life of my country is ended,” he told the European parliament). But that may not be what the British government wants to hear.  Boris Johnson is expected be in the Commons when Zelenskiy speaks. But he, in common with other Nato allies, has made clear he does not support a no-fly zone, partly because it is feared it could lead to a general war with Russia. “When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality of that involves shooting down Russian planes,” the UK prime minister said last week.  It may depend, therefore, on how Zelenskiy pitches his request. If Ukraine’s leader pivots, as he appeared to on Saturday, from asking for a no-fly zone towards an alternative demand for greater military aid, it could be effective. That would start with a call for Poland and other eastern European countries to supply Russian-made fighter jets of the type Ukraine’s pilots know how to fly.  Britain’s role here would be both to help persuade eastern European countries to part with their MiG-29s or similar and help provide replacement air support, and other more capable arms, such as air defence systems – all likely to be needed in the defence of Kyiv. The risk for Britain and the west is that greater rearmament will further provoke Russia, but facing a national existential crisis, Zelenskiy has no time to worry about that when he addresses MPs.

Poland  Ukraine’s close ally, with which it shares a 310-mile border, had received 1,204,403 refugees by Tuesday, the UNHCR said.  The government has announced plans to set up an 8bn złoty (£1.34bn) fund for people fleeing Ukraine, including the provision of a one-off payment of 300 złoty (£50) for each refugee.  Hungary  A country that seven years ago built barbed-wire fences and deployed attack dogs to keep out refugees had allowed 191,348 Ukrainians to enter by Monday, according to the UNHCR.  Local media claim that the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has softened his longstanding anti-refugee rhetoric ahead of April elections.  Slovakia  Slovakia, another neighbouring country, had taken in 140,745 Ukrainian refugees by Monday, the UNHCR said.  On 24 February, the country’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, said: “Slovakia is ready to help every Ukrainian who asks for such help.”  Moldova  One of the poorest countries in Europe, which relies heavily on Russian gas, had accepted 82,762 refugees from Ukraine by Sunday, the UNHCR said.  The government has expressed concerns about the possibility of being invaded by Russia, and is seeking to join the EU.  Germany  About 30,000 Ukrainian refugees have so far arrived, with most coming through Poland, according to reports on Monday.  The interior minister, Nancy Faeser, told the weekly Bild am Sonntag that Germany would take refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine no matter what their nationality.  France  About 2,500 Ukrainians had arrived in France, with some then looking to go to Spain and Portugal as well as the UK, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Sunday.  Ireland  The Irish government minister Roderic O’Gorman revealed on Tuesday that 2,200 Ukrainians had arrived in the country.  The day after Russia invaded, the Irish government lifted all visa restrictions. It also instructed airlines to accept Ukrainians who did not have passports but had some other form of ID such a driving licence or birth certificate.  United Kingdom  The Home Office said on Monday evening that it had granted visas to 300 Ukrainian refugees under its family scheme.  It said 17,700 applications to rejoin relatives were also being examined. A second visa scheme set up for Ukrainians, which involves being sponsored by an organisation or individual, is yet to begin.  Boris Johnson has ruled out setting up a third humanitarian scheme, which the home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed was being explored.  The government is under pressure to speed up and simplify the visa process. At present, applicants must hand over biometric details and fill in complex forms.

People have been leaving Sumy and Irpin in north Ukraine as fresh attempts are made to evacuate civilians from devastated areas on the 13th day of Russia’s invasion.  In the south, Ukraine has accused Russia of violating a ceasefire by shelling a humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol.  Russia has stepped up its shelling of Sumy, where 21 people, including two children, were killed overnight, according to local officials. Video footage showed people leaving the city on Tuesday:  Shelling was also stepped up against Chernihiv in the north and Mykolaiv in the south-west.  Officials have warned that the humanitarian situation in Mariupol, which has been without power, water or heating since Friday, is grave.  Ukraine’s intelligence service claimed its forces had killed the senior Russian army commander Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov outside Kharkiv. Footage shot on Monday shows neighbourhoods devastated by Russian bombardment:  The UN said the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine had passed 2 million.  What has happened since Russia invaded?  On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea.  On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer:  On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces.  On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack.  On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital.  On Wednesday 2, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it.  A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces.  On Friday 4, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe.  On Saturday 5 a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations.  On Sunday 6 civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed.  On Monday 7 Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus.  How did we get here?  Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine.  Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions.  The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded.  The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.  What do we know about Russia’s deployments?  Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.  An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion.  Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew.

Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters  These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year.  Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea.  The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February.  Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations.  How do the militaries compare?  Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland.  What is the historical context?  In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war.  A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement.  Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war.  What is the role of Nord Stream 2?  On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics.  First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.  Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.

The type of historical images we are more accustomed – and perhaps more inured – to seeing in monochrome are made breathtakingly new in colour, and this or that photo from the second world war is given such immediacy that it feels like something more relatable from our present.  Yet for the first time yesterday, I saw the technique work in the other direction. When an image of the vast and desperate crowds at Kharkiv train station was flying around, an ITN cameraman posted the same picture but in black and white, and it instantly felt 10 times more arresting. Happening right now was a tableau straight from Europe’s dark past – thousands of tightly packed people massed on a station platform and trying to flee, vastly outnumbering the available train space. Perhaps we know best how to read this picture when we literally see it in black and white.  Nearly 1,700 miles away in Calais, alas, another image surfaces. This is a piece of printer paper taped to a wall, perhaps by some cursed emissary of the British home office, which reads: NO VISAS DELIVERED IN CALAIS. For the exhausted Ukrainians who find it, two sparse instructions follow: 1. Type in a long and unwieldy URL to fill in a form. 2. Go all the way to Paris or Brussels to apply for a visa.  Why are we like this? In the words Alf Dubs, who arrived in the UK on the Kindertransport in 1939: “Shouldn’t we be ashamed of ourselves?” Why – yet again – does the Home Office respond to a crisis in a manner that appears to run the full gamut from nasty to useless? Contrary to all manner of contradictory spin from No 10 and the home secretary, “world-leading”, “tailored” and “bespoke” solutions and innovations are not making things easier for Ukrainians in their time of need.  Instead, the inevitable humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seems to have taken those who should have known better by surprise. Boris Johnson’s administration is tough on war but weak on what we know is its timeworn fallout.  At the time it was reported that Poland had taken 800,000 refugees, the UK had accepted a mere 50. Which, to put things into perspective, is half the number of people you’d invite to a Downing Street bring-your-own-bottle party in the middle of a lockdown. Outraged by this dated inaccuracy, the Home Office yesterday corrected the record to show that a whole 300 visas had now been granted to fleeing Ukrainians. Which is three BYOB guestlists, and a mere 2.7% of the number of refugees who arrived in Berlin last Friday alone.  The UK is reduced to preposterous sleights of hand, attempting to make a virtue of what amount to bars to entry. Yesterday the Home Office was trumpeting having “the first visa scheme in the world” to launch post-invasion, studiously ignoring the huge number of countries that have waived the need for visas entirely to tackle the crisis. “I am not going to be drawn into this,” breezed Foreign Office minister James Cleverly. “Because really this is a team sport, and we’re pulling together as a team on this.” The numbers indicate we’re not. We’re letting other countries do the pulling together while we sit in the boat and pontificate about the view.  Shambles is the kinder reading. The suspicion is that the system is functioning as designed – that these things are not happening to the Home Office and the government of which it is part, but because of them. Both No 10 and the Foreign Office slapped down Priti Patel’s mooted plan to open easier access for all those fleeing Ukraine. Fellow secretaries of state either offer pointed assistance to the Home Office or wash their hands of its operations. This morning Ben Wallace volunteered Ministry of Defence personnel support; yesterday Liz Truss sniffed: “It’s really a matter for the home secretary exactly how the visa process works.”  Can one of them – any of them – just get it together on this front? In the years and decades after the second world war, many nations in Europe and beyond looked back on their actions and came to the painful realisation that they could and should have done more in various ways, not least in accepting refugees. As images of exodus are now reminding us, history is never in the past. History is now. It will be to our enduring shame if we don’t try much harder to be on the right side of it.

This embarrassing piece of homework was in response to an impassioned rant I’d embarked on, during our session. “Everyone just keeps trumpeting their opinions like they know anything,” I said, pausing before admitting that my anger was also drawn from frustration at my own posting behaviour. “Why can’t I stop wading in?”  It’s a question I think many will be asking themselves. As Russian tanks began to roll across Ukrainian borders, so too began the real-time reactions. It was to be expected; for the roughly 53 million social media users in the UK, it is hardly unfamiliar in 2022 to see reality filtered through Twitter timelines and Instagram feeds. Despite what some have claimed, the conflict is not even close to being the “first social media war” . But it is the first of this scale on the back doorstep of the west. For many millions in the UK, the war feels closer to home, both in terms of geography and the online spaces they inhabit, a fact disappointingly evidenced by broadcasters drawing oafish comparisons between the shock of combat in “civilised” Europe v conflicts in the “developing world”.  This has played out online in an onslaught of opinions and infographics. Surreal moments of well-meaning intervention have occurred, such as popstar Dua Lipa entreating her nearly 80 million Instagram followers to donate to the Ukrainian army. Elsewhere, social media users have held forth on everything from whether nuclear weapons would totally or partly destroy the human race, to the role of astrology in current events.  On social media, to be silent is to be found wanting. Despite the different registers of specific platforms (Instagram, for example, is all earnest “awareness”, whereas TikTok is laced with a frenetic, theatre-kid energy), all of them depend on compelling users to actively produce and engage with content. In times of crisis, this demand – baked into code in order to ensure profit for tech bosses – has found itself expressed as a moral obligation. In the case of Ukraine, to visibly engage and express solidarity is viewed as akin to enacting it through practical, tangible action. We are not looking away. We are analysing, boosting and amplifying. We are posting through it.  In times of shared distress, people have always coalesced to engage in a collective exercise in sense-making. But the problem is, the online spaces where we gather now are not ones that encourage measured conversations, or the admission that we know little, or maybe nothing at all. Instead, social media platforms are built around the cult of the individual, where knowledge is always delivered in a tone of utmost authority. Counter-knowledge is proffered combatively. The picture in Ukraine doesn’t seem much clearer, but the chatter of social media is a cacophony.  People want to be plugged in: this week’s huge jump in viewership for BBC “heavyweight” political offerings such as Newsnight demonstrate that. But many of us have also become conditioned to post our thought processes, analysis and reactions as a stream of consciousness, on platforms where everything – technically – is treated with the same import and weight. Often in these spaces, the overwhelming nature of the information we are bombarded with flattens into a focus on smaller, more accessible details, resulting in pedantic debates about military capacity and so on. There’s a tendency to view the conflict through the lens of our pre-existing disputes (see: bizarre claims about the west’s failure to confront Russia being caused in part because it has been distracted by pronouns). In the cold light of day, all this seems monumentally narrow and grubby.  It’s not that these social feeds haven’t resulted in materially useful outcomes. The mobilisation of global Black communities, led by Black British women, not only alerted the general public to horrific racism being faced by Black and Brown students attempting to flee Ukraine, but also provided practical financial support for those who remain trapped. Verified donation schemes have been able to tap into ready-made audiences, primed and eager to help. Slowly, mass outrage at brazen government refusal to aid refugees from the region is chipping away at the Home Office’s determination not to waive visa recommendations. When social media meets specific organisational goals that can be translated into practical action, then we see worthwhile results.  Too often, however, that truth is forgotten or pushed aside in the heady rush to post our way out of powerlessness. Isn’t that it? What is happening in Ukraine – as is what is happening in the likes of Palestine and Tigray, and all the regions where conflict rages – exposes our individual helplessness. It is a shock to be reminded of your own personal impotence in the face of geopolitical forces. Turning to the internet, where your voice echoes loudly once more, and a reshare is trumpeted as a quick solution to the distress, is a balm.  But it’s a fleeting feeling of catharsis. Closing Twitter after a long day of sharing opinions leaves me spent, and often angry, but no closer to feeling as if I’ve made any real difference. The solution is, of course, one that’s existed for aeons: engage in the unshowy, sustainable work of collective organising. Pulling together donations for refugees. Fundraising. Mounting further pressure on the Home Office to immediately waive visa requirements. None of that precludes posting on social media, especially if you really do know what you’re talking about. But I’m not convinced that many of us do, to be honest. It’s a lesson in humility and forgoing the short-lived fix. I think the annals of history can survive this round without my take.

The way to do this is via all-out economic warfare, not the weak sanctions and half-measures that have been put in place so far. All political, diplomatic, military and economic means, short of war with Russia, must be deployed in synergy to ensure Ukraine continues to resist and Russia weakens and fails. Providing weapons, supplies and intelligence to the Ukrainian armed forces is key. But much more must be done right now to wage economic warfare to undermine Putin’s capacity to continue this war.  We need to deplete Russian state income by limiting its trade with the west. Every day, the US, UK and EU buy more than $700m worth of oil, gas and other commodities from Russia. Some of Russia’s largest state-owned companies, which are key for commodities trading, have not been sanctioned. Economies in Europe, especially Germany and Italy, must start preparing now for life without Russian gas and threaten a full embargo.  In the financial sector, we must impose blanket sanctions against all Belarusian and Russian banks and put them on the US specially designated nationals list – which will block their assets and make it illegal for anyone in the US to do business with them. All Russian and Belarusian banks should be disconnected from the world’s main banking messaging service, Swift. Sanctions should be imposed on rouble clearing, ​meaning no transactions in roubles are possible and in effect trade is blocked, and there must be a full ban on US and UK public sector pension funds from holding Russian assets. Cryptocurrency wallets linked to Russia should be identified and seized.  Finally, the 5,000 members of the Russian political, economic and military elite and their families must be banned from obtaining visas to the UK, US and EU. These privileges should be reinstated to anybody publicly declaring that they disagree with Vladimir Putin’s war and resigning. And if those in control of the military operation in Ukraine are seeking another off-ramp, they could defect now and be granted immunity for war crimes, which should be investigated by a special tribunal into the aggression against Ukraine.  We know that sanctions work. At the very start of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the US, EU and UK acted swiftly – freezing a large part of the Russian central nank’s $638bn reserves was a significant blow. Roughly $403bn of the bank’s foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars, euros, pounds and other western currencies. Russia now cannot access these funds. A range of Russian banks were cut off from the Swift payments system, which will effectively block the country from importing and exporting from and to the EU. About 80% of the Russian banking sector is currently under US sanctions.  The impact of these measures on the Russian economy is already substantial and will only become more exacerbated over time. The value of Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange dropped by 98%; the rouble continues to plummet and has already lost 40% of its value. The central bank is desperately trying to prop up the rouble by imposing capital controls and doubling its interest rate to 20%.  The Russian leadership now represents a pariah state. Individual financial sanctions are already in place and travel bans are in the making. Putin’s foreign assets, along with those of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov , defence minister Sergei Shoigu and members of the Russian security council have been frozen. The EU has sanctioned all 351 members of the parliament who voted to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk. More than a dozen billionaire oligarchs with ties to Putin are subject to asset freezes and travel bans. The UK’s list, however, is shamefully small – only three such individuals are included. But the UK government is working on new legislation that would allow it to act upon oligarch “hitlists”.  In the private sector, the tide is changing too: multinationals are treating Russia as a toxic market. Major energy, tech, consumer goods, car and plane manufacturers are pulling out of Russia. A global campaign to boycott Russian goods is under way to pressure all companies to stop cooperation with the aggressor state. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund declared its $3bn investments in Russia worthless overnight. This is just a harbinger of what is to come for private and pension funds holding Russian assets.  All these efforts are heading in the right direction, but they should be intensified, as Putin intensifies his war of terror in Ukraine. One easy and swift step would be to cancel the one-month grace period for US initial sanctions.  Let us not forget that Putin declared war on Ukraine and bombarded its sleeping cities. He decided to wage war to satisfy his neo-imperialist ambitions, his desire to stay in power and his intent to destroy what is left of the global world order.  What is unfolding in Ukraine is something not seen in Europe since the second world war. Putin’s Blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv failed and the Ukrainian armed forces are successfully repelling the Russian army on the battlefield. The Kremlin is now laying siege to large cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv and is razing to the ground smaller cities such as Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha. His soldiers kill civilians trying to flee. There is evidence of deliberate targeting of civilian buildings, including using cluster bombs, which are banned under the Geneva conventions. Russia violates ceasefires, and 200,000 women and children are unable to exit Mariupol via agreed humanitarian corridors. And the situation will only get worse in the coming weeks.  So, yes, Putin must fail. But the west must find the courage to ensure that happens. If boots on the ground and no-fly zones are off the table, then the west’s response to this war must be economic warfare in the name of defending democracy and freedom. There are costs to be shared by all, but also benefits, if Ukraine shields the rest of Europe from the horrors of war too. With the support of the west, Ukraine could become an open democratic society again – a keystone of European security right next to Russia.  Because by ensuring that Putin fails, we ensure that Putinism at large fails too, and with it the idea that brutal military force can be used to restore a former imperial possession.

Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine is already escalating faster than most experts would have imagined just a week ago. He has now encircled major Ukrainian cities with his army and threatens to flatten them with thermobaric weapons, cluster munitions and guided missiles. This will terrorize the civilian population and could demoralize the budding Ukrainian resistance. He could escalate the conflict to another region, such as the Balkans, where longstanding conflicts fester and Russia has an extensive network of intelligence and security services. He may turn the lights off in a major US city with a cyber-attack. Most frighteningly, he has raised the alert level of Russian nuclear forces and may be considering introducing martial law.  Meanwhile, Nato, the G7 and a host of other countries have turned the dial of economic punishment up to unprecedented levels. Several European nations that had previously hesitated to involve themselves militarily in the conflict have now done so, sending weapons and financing Ukraine’s resistance. A growing number of voices in Washington are clamoring for a more aggressive approach from the United States and Nato, pressuring the White House to support a Ukrainian insurgency with a broad menu of weaponry or even calling for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.  Amid this escalation, experts can spin out an infinite number of branching scenarios on how this might end. But scores of war games conducted for the US and allied governments and my own experience as the US national intelligence officer for Europe suggest that if we boil it down, there are really only two paths toward ending the war: one, continued escalation, potentially across the nuclear threshold; the other, a bitter peace imposed on a defeated Ukraine that will be extremely hard for the United States and many European allies to swallow.  Putin deliberately frames his operation in Ukraine in the same way that the United States has framed its own regime-change operations in Kosovo, Iraq and Libya, charging that Ukraine has committed human rights violations and is a terrorist state. For good measure, Putin throws in the ludicrous assertion that Ukraine is fascist. These are transparent fig leaves for what is nothing more than a war of brute imperialism.  Judging from how things stand now, Putin, having invested so much in this war already, seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government. If the current uneven pace of Russian military progress doesn’t accomplish the job, the most likely strategy for doing this is to make an example of a city like Kharkiv, leveling it as if it were Grozny or Aleppo, both cities that Russia has brutally destroyed in the recent past, and then threatening to burn Kyiv to the ground. He can accompany this with special forces attacks in the capital to disrupt the civilian population and sow further confusion and discontent. Ultimately, he needs at least to force the removal of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his government.  In this case, Russia will install a puppet government in Kyiv, which will sign terms of surrender highly favorable to Russia. The terms will almost certainly include a pledge of Ukrainian neutrality, and might go further by committing Ukraine formally to Russia’s sphere of influence with a membership in Russia’s Collective Security Treaty Organization or its Eurasian Economic Union.  Putin seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government  At this juncture, the United States and its allies would face an extraordinarily difficult policy choice. Disgust with Putin’s war has greatly increased the chances that Washington and some of its allies would seek to fight on, for instance by supporting a Ukrainian insurgency. This would roughly mirror the strategy that the United States used to assist French resistance against Nazi Germany. The more effective Nato support to the insurgency is, the more the Kremlin would likely be willing to risk attacks on safe havens in Nato territory – most likely employing irregular forces or even the infamous Wagner Group, a private organization that operates globally as a quasi-special force of the Kremlin. These operations could lead to a massive escalation that would open the door to a much wider war between Nato and Russia – exactly the war that Joe Biden has been trying to avoid.  Alternatively, the insurgency might greatly weaken Russian forces. The Ukrainian insurgent army could impose heavy damages on Russian forces and erode Putin’s position among Russian elites, on whose support he depends for power. Ukrainian forces would have major incentives to take their fight inside Russian territory, attacking Russia’s rearguard in Belarus and Russia itself.  There are possible other paths toward further escalation, but they all eventually lead toward the nuclear threshold. Scores of war games carried out by the United States and its allies in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine make it clear that Putin would probably use a nuclear weapon if he concludes that his regime is threatened. It is hard to know exactly what turn of events would scare him enough to cross the nuclear threshold. Certainly a large Nato army entering Russian territory would be enough. But what if events in Ukraine loosened his grip on power at home? Indeed, achieving regime change in Russia indirectly by making Putin lose in Ukraine seems to be the logic behind some of those who are pushing for escalation today.  Moving across the nuclear threshold wouldn’t necessarily mean an immediate, full-force nuclear exchange – in other words, global thermonuclear war. But it would be an extremely dangerous, watershed event in world history.  The nuclear option that has been most frequently discussed in the past few days involves Russia using a small nuclear weapon (a “non-strategic nuclear weapon”) against a specific military target in Ukraine. Such a strike might have a military purpose, such as destroying an airfield or other military target, but it would mainly be aimed at demonstrating the will to use nuclear weapons, or “escalating to de-escalate”, and scaring the west into backing down.  Some analysts have questioned Russia’s ability to actually carry out such an operation, given its lack of practice. Unfortunately, this isn’t the only or even the most likely option available to the Kremlin. Based on war games I ran in the wake of Putin’s 2014 invasion, a more likely option would be a sudden nuclear test or a high-altitude nuclear detonation that damages the electrical grid over a major Ukrainian or even Nato city. Think of an explosion that makes the lights go out over Oslo.  Those war games indicated that the best US response to this kind of attack would be first to demonstrate US resolve with a response in kind, aimed at a target of similar value, followed by restraint and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate. In most games, Russia still responds with a second nuclear attack, but in the games that go “well”, the United States and Russia manage to de-escalate after that, although only in circumstances where both sides have clear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed.  Even in the better case where both sides take their fingers off the triggers, the nuclear taboo has been broken, and we are in an entirely new era: two nuclear superpowers have used their nuclear weapons in a war. The proliferation consequences alone would be far-reaching, as other countries accelerate their nuclear weapons programs. The very fact that the nuclear taboo had been broken increases the odds that the nuclear threshold is crossed again in future conflicts, not just between Russia and America, but also with China, between India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, or elsewhere. Even this outcome in which the world is “saved”, the United States is far worse off than it was before the war in Ukraine broke out last month.  What is the alternative? Once again, infinite scenarios and branches are possible, but there is a single basic one that helps to simplify thinking. It begins with an effort to avoid further escalation today. So far, the Biden administration has wisely restrained direct US military involvement in the conflict, but holding off against the rising chorus of voices pushing for escalation may be hard in the coming days if Russian forces brutally devastate Ukraine’s cities. But the most difficult challenge lies a little further down the road with the scenario described above: how to respond if Russia imposes a puppet regime in Ukraine. This would put the United States in the near-impossible position of having to choose between further escalation and compromising on the very principles that drove it toward the war in the first place – the right of a nation like Ukraine to be free and independent of subjugation to foreign rule.  In this scenario, the Biden administration would have to show extraordinary leadership and strength to hold together its coalition and steer it toward restraint. It would face extremely high levels of pressure from European capitals, Ukrainian lobbies, and others to reject the puppet government and fight on, perhaps by recognizing a Ukrainian government-in-exile. The administration is already facing calls from hawkish corners of Washington to pre-empt any negotiated settlement to this war. Emotions are likely to have a much greater effect on the free democracies fighting for Ukraine than on the autocrat sitting in the Kremlin, but they will affect both sides. As they escalate, the prospects of negotiation diminish further.  Would Nato’s door remain open to a Russian-dominated Ukraine? Probably, but it would be similar to claiming that Nato’s door is open to North Korea or Iran (which it theoretically is). All of the consequences that are likely from this conflict – growing conventional force buildup on the Nato-Russia border, higher levels of defense spending in the United States at the expense of domestic programs, an end to efforts to draw down US military posture in the Middle East, and fewer resources for strategic competition with China – would still be a better outcome than the alternative, in which nuclear weapons have been used.  Wars can start quickly or slowly, but it is a dictum of strategy that once started, they take on a logic of their own. It is not too soon to think about how to bring this war to a close. The chances that Putin emerges strategically weak are real. But that does not mean the US can win. It will have to settle for a picture that is much uglier than it was before the war, and the sooner Washington accepts that, the better.

Australia’s death toll from the east coast floods rose to 21 on Tuesday as a massive stretch of the New South Wales coast endured dangerous winds and heavy rains, causing landslides and wild surf conditions as the second east coast low in a week moved in.  About 50,000 people were told to leave their homes across NSW including 40,000 residents in more than a dozen Sydney suburbs including the northern beaches.  EROWAL BAY flooding from St Georges Basin this morning. Stay clear of low lying rivers, streams, storm drains and stay safe out there. 💧 pic.twitter.com/kwSkXFTxIp — NSW SES (@NSWSES) March 8, 2022  Two bodies were discovered in western Sydney on Tuesday morning – a 67-year-old woman and her 34-year-old son from Wentworthville. Their abandoned car was found earlier and their deaths took the NSW toll to eight. Thirteen people have died in Queensland’s floods.  The worst of the NSW flooding on Tuesday affected Sydney’s northern suburbs and northern beaches. Roseville Bridge, which crosses Middle harbour, was inundated, trapping cars and causing major delays.  Residents in low-lying areas below Manly Dam were urged to evacuate as the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, warned the dam had begun spilling, potentially affecting about 2,000 people in 800 homes.  The State Emergency Services later amended the order to an evacuation warning as water levels at the dam dropped slightly.  In nearby Dee Why, water up to a metre deep surged down a main thoroughfare.  At Mackellar girls campus in Manly Vale, students watched cars float past the windows in deep water. One parent at the school said her daughter had to wade through water to get out of the school.  “An email was sent about 1pm advising us to pick up kids from Quirk Road,” the parent said. “They were calling kids’ names as we arrived over the loudspeaker to leave.  “Water was over the top of cars and spilling into the bottom levels of the lower blocks. My daughter had to walk through knee-deep water to get out as she was in the hall.”  00:52 Sydney high school students watch car float away in floods – video  There were 64 evacuation orders in place on Tuesday evening from the Kempsey CBD in northern NSW down to the Illawarra region south of Sydney, with a further 17 evacuation warnings affecting another 18,000 people.  Among the latest orders was one for Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches which were being hammered by hazardous surf that will last into Thursday for a lot of the NSW coast.  The Bureau of Meteorology updated its warning for damaging winds and heavy rain for an area ranging from near Newcastle southwards towards Bega.  “Damaging winds averaging 60 to 80 km/h with peak gusts of about 110 km/h are possible over the coastal fringes of the Illawarra and Sydney metropolitan districts this evening,” the BoM said.    Heavy rainfall threatened to cause flash flooding in the southern parts of the Hunter, Sydney metro region, Illawarra and northern parts of the south coast districts, the BoM said. Rainfall totals in the next six hours could be between 70mm and 100 mm.  Sydney itself has had its wettest start to any year, with 821.6mm as of Tuesday morning, well ahead of the nearest rival period in 1956, a Weatherzone meteorologist said. By Tuesday evening, the tally had risen by another 41mm.  Some of Tuesday’s heaviest falls were centred on the northern parts of Sydney, with 102mm recorded at Monavale Golf Club in the three hours to 3.30pm. Other big totals included 124mm at Forestville over a six-hour period and 128.5mm at Mosman in a similar timeframe.  Authorities closed many of the main roads surrounding the Georges River in the south-west of the city, including Henry Lawson Drive and Milperra Road, with entire sections of streets completely underwater.  The three major routes into the northern beaches were closed to all traffic, shutting thousands of residents out of the CBD.  Many residents could only watch on as the water swallowed up their homes and cars. Thousands of residents in the south-west were ordered to evacuate on Monday night as heavy rain caused rivers to swell.  The usually bustling Newbridge Road in Sydney’s south-west was closed by authorities, with the river having risen up to 3.65 metres earlier on Tuesday, and with the water reaching up to 1.5 metres in homes.

Testa, a boat broker, said the first level of his parent’s home was completely underwater, and that it was the second time in three days their home had flooded.  “We got about a metre and a half of water, it’s the second time in three days, it’s been absolutely crazy,” Testa said. “But it is what it is. Water comes up, then goes down.  “We had a guy walking through last night, with water up to his neck. We picked him up and took him to the end of the street, we’ve had people stuck in their houses, who had initially decided to wait out the flood but found they couldn’t.”  Can’t say I’ve ever taken a boat down Newbridge Road, but here we are.

Dean Narramore from the BoM said it had been a “devastating week” for the state, with the conditions not expected to ease until Thursday.  “Both the Hawkesbury River and the Nepean River are in danger of major flooding with many locations experiencing levels equal to or greater than what we saw in March of 2021,” Narramore said.  #SevereThunderstormWarning updated for #Intense rainfall that will lead to life threatening flash flooding and possible landslides for parts of northeast #Sydney.

At Kempsey, the Macleay River was expected to peak at 6.3 metres on Tuesday evening near the major flood level of 6.6 metres.  The last time flood waters reached that level was in the 2013 floods when the river reached 7.1 metres. Other rivers, including the Hawkesbury-Nepean, were flooding at levels exceeding last week and surpassing March 2021.  The Hawkesbury River is now higher at North Richmond and Windsor than it was last week.

The SES had conducted 147 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 4pm on Tuesday with almost 3,000 calls for assistance. Nearly 900 people were in temporary accommodation.  Perrottet said there needed to be “frank assessments” of the state’s disaster mitigation strategies once the severe weather event had subsided.

Jia Qingguo, a member of China’s highest political advisory body, said he also believed the proliferation of misinformation online had fuelled tensions between China and foreign countries.  “For example, there are often people online who, for some purpose, package a foreigner’s vicious remarks against China as the view of everyone in that country towards China in order to incite the Chinese people’s dissatisfaction and hostility towards said country and its people,” Jia said in an interview on Saturday with online news portal The Cover, which is affiliated with the state-owned Sichuan Daily.  The former dean of the prestigious Peking University’s School of International Studies added that the spread of fake news could harm national interests, and lead to public confusion and social division. He called on Beijing to introduce specific measures to “severely punish” those who create false information to “cause serious harm to society”.  Jia said motivations for creating and spreading fake news vary. Some use it to vent their dissatisfaction, others profit through click-baiting, or use it for unfair competition, for example. He pointed out that some netizens spread fake news because of their narrow nationalistic mentality.  But while Jia’s proposal appears to be more domestic-focused, observers question any tangible impact of a “fake information law” when China’s internet is already heavily censored and often scrubbed of information Beijing wants to disappear.  Some also worry that, if not properly implemented, such a law could have a profound impact on journalistic activities in China by both domestic and foreign news outlets, given Beijing’s track record in press freedom. In the last few years, for example, China has called reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang “fake news” or “lie of the century”.  “China has so many laws and policies restricting freedom of expression that this sort of proposal seems completely superfluous,” William Nee, research and advocacy coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said.  Critics say that misinformation that supports Beijing’s narrative, such as conspiracy theories against the US, reaches millions of people each day on Chinese social media platforms. In the last few weeks, Chinese social media has been overwhelmed with misinformation about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which China’s state media call “special military operations”.  Jia warned that when people could not differentiate truthful information from disinformation, polarisation would intensify in society, and extreme views amplified. This, he said, could lead to an increase in opposing emotions and reflected in the phenomena of anti-officials, anti-wealth and anti-elites.  Jia also said that fake information could lead to hostility towards foreigners. His warning came as public opinion in China towards foreign reporters has become increasingly antagonistic as tension between Beijing and the west grows. Foreign journalists in China have reported an increasingly hostile work environment since Beijing expelled more than 20 American journalists in 2021.  In its most recent report in January, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said Beijing was finding new ways to intimidate foreign reporters. The club also expressed “dismay” last month over restrictions on reporting during the Beijing Winter Olympics, which they said “fell short of international standards”.  Beijing frequently uses accusations of fake news to take aim at foreign reporting it deems unfavourable. Last July, Beijing accused the BBC of fake news in its reporting on serious floods in the city of Zhengzhou, slamming the broadcaster for “smearing and attacking China”.  Foreign correspondents have reported receiving harassment and streams of vitriol on social media platforms over their reporting from the country’s legion of nationalistic trolls, known as “the little pinks”, who direct fury and vitriol at perceived slights to China’s self-image and sensibilities.  A fake news law has also been floated in Hong Kong, where Beijing has been accused of muzzling its free press since mid-2020. The changes in media landscape in the former British colony have prompted independent newsrooms to shut down, hundreds of reporters to lose their jobs, and jitters among its foreign press corps.  Right advocates have raised concerns that any content can be arbitrarily censored under the label of “fake news”.  “In reality we’ve seen the label of ‘fake news’ used to discredit human rights defenders, and so I’m afraid such a tool could become just another malicious tool for the authorities to silence unwanted opinions and information,” Nee said.

A 12-member jury was scheduled to begin deliberating on Tuesday for Guy Wesley Reffitt’s trial on charges that he stormed the Capitol with a holstered handgun strapped to his waist and interfered with police officers guarding the Senate doors.  He also is charged with threatening his teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement after the attack on 6 January 2021.  Assistant US attorney Risa Berkower told jurors that Reffitt drove to Washington intending to stop Congress certifying Joe Biden’s electoral victory, to “overthrow Congress” and to drag lawmakers out of the building.  Reffitt proudly “lit the fire” that allowed others in the mob to overwhelm Capitol police officers, the prosecutor said during the trial’s closing arguments.  “They were in an impossible situation – outnumbered and, they feared, outgunned,” Berkower said of police.  Reffitt, 49, from Wylie, Texas, didn’t testify at his trial, which started last Wednesday. Defense attorney William Welch didn’t call any defense witnesses after prosecutors rested their case.  Welch urged jurors to acquit Reffitt of all charges but one. He said they should convict him of a misdemeanor charge that he entered and remained in a restricted area.  “That is what proof beyond a reasonable doubt looks like, but it ends there,” Welch said.  Reffitt faces five felony counts: obstruction of an official proceeding, being unlawfully present on Capitol grounds while armed with a firearm, transporting firearms during a civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement officers during a civil disorder and obstructing justice. The obstructing justice charge relates to his alleged threats against his children.  Welch denied that Reffitt had a gun at the Capitol and said there is no evidence that he engaged in any violence or destructive behavior on January 6.  “Guy does brag a lot,” Welch said. “He embellishes and he exaggerates.”  “Yes, Guy Reffitt brags,” assistant US attorney Jeffrey Nestler countered. “And you know what he brags about? The truth.”  Reffitt was arrested less than a week after the riot at the Capitol. He has been jailed in Washington for months.  Reffitt is a member of the “Texas Three Percenters” and bragged about his involvement in the riot to other members of the group, according to prosecutors. The Three Percenters militia movement refers to the myth that only 3% of American colonists fought against the British in the revolutionary war.  On Friday, jurors heard testimony from a self-described Texas Three Percenters member who drove from Texas to Washington with Reffitt. Rocky Hardie said he and Reffitt both had holstered handguns strapped to their bodies when they attended Donald Trump’s Stop the Steal rally just before the riot.  On Thursday, Reffitt’s 19-year-old son, Jackson, testified that his father told him and his sister, then 16, they would be traitors if they reported him to authorities and said “traitors get shot”.  On 6 January 2021, Reffitt had the holstered gun under his jacket, was carrying zip-tie handcuffs and was wearing body armor when he and other rioters advanced on police officers on the west side of the Capitol, according to prosecutors.  “Every step he took up the railing, the crowd came with him,” Berkhower said. “The crowd was energized and cheered him on.”  Reffitt is not accused of entering the building. He retreated after an officer pepper-sprayed him in the face, prosecutors said.  Berkower played surveillance video of the rioters who poured into the building while the then vice-president, Mike Pence, was presiding over the Senate. She said it was a dark day in American history, but not for Reffitt.  “He was ecstatic about what he did, about what the mob did,” she added. “What the defendant did was not just bragging or hype.”  Welch accused prosecutors of rushing to judgment.  “Be the grown-ups in the courtroom. Separate the facts from the hype,” he told jurors.  More than 750 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. A verdict in Reffitt’s case could have an enormous impact on many others. A conviction could give prosecutors more leverage over defendants facing the most serious charges. An acquittal could embolden other defendants to seek more favorable plea deals or gamble on trials of their own.  More than 220 defendants have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors and over 110 of them have been sentenced. Approximately 90 others have trial dates.

Suggesting a coordinated response to record gas prices could help ease the pressure on households, experts told MPs on the Commons business committee that steps to reduce national demand for gas-fired power next winter could be deployed.  Michael Bradshaw, a professor of global energy at the University of Warwick, said lessons could be learned from Japan, where the government launched a national movement to cut energy usage after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident.  He also said Britain could look to the 1970s, when campaigns to reduce energy consumption were run in the UK in response to the oil price shocks triggered by the Yom Kippur war.  “Perhaps we need to learn the lessons of the past,” he told MPs in response to questions about the UK’s energy security after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  “We do need to think of ways of building resilience going into next winter where people can make adjustments. They have got summer to do it – but more importantly they understand how their heating system works and what measures they can take to turn it down and save money.”  Tokyo ran a media campaign called Setsuden (power saving) after the Fukushima disaster, calling for neon lights to be switched off, trains to run slower and households to cut their energy consumption.  In the UK a campaign called Save it ran during the 1970s, to highlight energy waste, while the late former Conservative cabinet minister Patrick Jenkin achieved notoriety as a shadow energy minister by urging Britons to brush their teeth in the dark to save electricity.  Experts have warned soaring gas prices amid the conflict in Ukraine will drive up household energy costs later this year, contributing to the worst squeeze on living standards since the mid-70s.  Bradshaw said families could be encouraged to turn down their boilers or turn off radiators. Last week the International Energy Agency suggested Europeans could turn down their thermostats by a degree, as part of a 10-point plan to save on gas and reduce dependency on Russian imports.  “It’s a case of ‘support Ukraine, lag your loft’,” Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, told the MPs on Tuesday. He suggested that more could be done to insulate homes and invest in renewable energy to boost Britain’s resilience against energy shocks.  However, the experts dismissed suggestions from backbench Conservatives that embracing fracking could help offset the impact of soaring gas prices and reduce dependency on Russian energy.  “Its time has passed,” Bradshaw said. “We had a conversation. At the moment there is no way that it really should be part of our discussions because it can’t deliver in time.”  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The British Geological Survey estimated in 2013 that between 23.3tn and 64.6tn cubic metres of shale gas could be in place in the north of England. However, Bradshaw said the potential was wildly different from the amount that could be physically extracted, while it would take years to achieve commercial production.  “Although we hear of 50 years of gas beneath the ground, that’s the gas-in-place estimate. If you ask me what’s the current level of reserves of shale gas in the UK, the answer is zero, because we’ve not gone through an exploration programme,” he said.  “I simply don’t see that the industry can gain the pace and scale to make a material difference. It makes far more sense to accelerate measures that get us off fossil fuels.”  Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said it would take a long time to reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels but that a focus on renewables would help increase the country’s energy sovereignty.  “We cannot control wholesale prices so instead we need to focus our efforts on how we adapt and cope with those prices, rather than trying to control them [in the short term],” he said.

Such efforts had failed for more than a century.  Bobby Rush, the Illinois Democrat who introduced the measure in the House, said: “Despite more than 200 attempts to outlaw this heinous form of racial terror at the federal level, it has never before been done. Today, we corrected that historic injustice. Next stop: [Joe Biden’s] desk.”  The New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, Senate co-sponsor with Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican, said: “The time is past due to reckon with this dark chapter in our history and I’m proud of the bipartisan support to pass this important piece of legislation.”  Subject to Biden’s signature, the bill will make lynching a hate crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison.  According to the Equal Justice Initiative, about 4,400 African Americans were lynched in the US between the end of Reconstruction, in the 1870s, and the years of the second world war. Some killings were watched by crowds. postcards and souvenirs were sometimes sold.  The bill heading for Biden’s desk is named for Emmett Till, who was 14 when he was tortured and murdered in Mississippi in August 1955. Two white men were tried but acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury, then confessed. The killing helped spark the civil rights movement.  The House passed Rush’s anti-lynching measure 422-3. Three Republicans voted no: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Chip Roy of Texas and Andrew Clyde of Georgia.  In 2020, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis and amid national protests for racial justice, the chamber passed an earlier version of the bill with a similar bipartisan vote.  Then, the measure was blocked in the Senate. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said he did so because “the bill as written would allow altercations resulting in a cut, abrasion, bruise or any other injury no matter how temporary to be subject to a 10-year penalty”.  Paul also called lynchings a “horror” and said he supported the bill but for its too-broad language.  Kamala Harris, then a senator from California, now vice-president, called Paul’s stance “insulting”.  Late last year, in another high-profile case, three white men were convicted in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who went jogging in a Georgia neighbourhood.  In an interview published on Tuesday, Christine Turner, director of the Oscar-nominated short Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day, referred to the Arbery murder when she told the Guardian: “There are many what people refer to as modern-day lynchings that may cause some people to take our history of lynching more seriously.”  On Monday, in a further statement, Rush said lynching was “a long-standing and uniquely American weapon of racial terror that has for decades been used to maintain the white hierarchy.  “Perpetrators of lynching got away with murder time and time again – in most cases, they were never even brought to trial … Today, we correct this historic and abhorrent injustice.”  He also cited a great civil rights leader: “I am reminded of Dr King’s famous words: ‘The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.’”

In 2017, I lost two friends, who were murdered by men. Those experiences reinforced my desire to write about the experiences and perspectives of women in the countries I have covered in the Middle East; highlighting the remarkable strength and resilience of women and girls I have met in the region is a powerful antidote.  Fidan Ataselim in Istanbul is one of these women. She is one of the founders of the Turkish campaign group We Will Stop Femicide, a group of women fighting tooth and nail to bring down Turkey’s shockingly high – and climbing – levels of violence against women.  Fidan Ataselim speaks to demonstrators at a protest against Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul convention last June. Photograph: Diego Cupolo/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock  Turkish civil society faces a climate of repression under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s conservative government. It is increasingly difficult to organise large-scale protests but, despite that, Ataselim organises rallies, lobbyes politicians and provides support for victims and their families, which is sorely lacking from the state. Part of her work also involves compiling data on femicide deaths, since Ankara does not keep records.  Basic rights and protections won by Turkish women are increasingly under threat. Last year, the country withdrew from a landmark European legal convention designed to protect victims of male violence and prosecute offenders more effectively over fears that provisions for LGBTQ+ individuals dilute traditional “family values”.  But despite the very real possibility of arrest, imprisonment and death threats, Ataselim keeps going. As she once told me: “More women are demanding their right to work and go to university. The more choices we have, the more intense the backlash gets.”  Bethan McKernan is the Jerusalem correspondent for the Guardian  Sarah Johnson on Sandra Santos, Brazil  After spending three days shadowing Sandra Santos, a healthcare professional who specialises in educating young people about HIV in São Paulo, I was floored by her passion and determination. Santos works at Emilio Ribas hospital, one of the biggest infectious diseases centres in Brazil, and has dedicated her life to helping and empowering young people who live with HIV.  Sandra Santos, centre, with patients Renata Ferreira, right, and Thiago Martin outside Emilio Ribas hospital in São Paulo. Photograph: Sarah Johnson/The Guardian  Her job transcends the hospital walls; when I was there in January 2020, she was helping a group of patients, who had contracted the virus from their mothers, to set up their own organisation to educate others about HIV. She was also negotiating access into some of the city’s favelas to reach the most vulnerable people, who often have limited access to health services.  It was clear that those she helped were more than patients to her; she told me that, one year, 17 people she had worked with died and how hard it was to go from a funeral to a birthday party.  She is tough, but also sensitive and incredibly caring. I really admire her strength and resolve. It was only on the last day when we were saying our goodbyes that she broke down in tears, revealing a little of the toll of working with a group of people who are so often forgotten and maligned by society.  Sarah Johnson is a Global Development reporter for the Guardian  Angela Giuffrida on Debora Porrà, Italy  I have come across so many fantastic women in Italy while doing my job, from chefs and politicians to doctors and professors, it is difficult to choose one who has inspired me the most. But someone who made an impact over the last year is Debora Porrà, the mayor of Villamassargia, a town in southern Sardinia. Porrà, in her second term of office, is among a group of female mayors in Sardinia who campaign for women’s rights – and who put their words into action.  Debora Porrà, mayor of the Sardinian town of Villamassargia. Photograph: Courtesy of Debora Porrà  I first interviewed her for a story about Italy’s declining birthrate. Her town has one of the lowest birthrates in the country, and she told me how the group had managed to delay the closure of the maternity unit in the province’s only hospital – in Italy there has to be 500 births a year at a hospital for funding to be maintained. They were also fighting for women to get access to pain-free births, as provision of epidural pain relief is not common in Sardinia.  I kept in touch with Porrà and asked if she could recommend somewhere to stay when I visited Sardinia for work last summer. I was surprised, and obviously overjoyed, to be lined up with a place by the beach, and then invited to celebrate her birthday at a lunch with family and friends. Porrà is not only an inspiration and passionate about improving lives, but one of the kindest people I’ve met in Italy.  Angela Giuffrida is the Guardian’s Rome correspondent  Rebecca Ratcliffe on Kyal Sin, known as Angel, Myanmar  On 3 March 2021, Kyal Sin, known as Angel, joined a demonstration against Myanmar’s military junta on the streets of Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city. She wore a black, oversized T-shirt that read: “Everything will be OK.”  She remains a symbol of courage and defiance  It was about a month after the military had seized power, and security forces were using increasingly deadly violence against protesters. She was aware of the dangers she might face. Beforehand, she had shared details of her blood group on Facebook, as well as an emergency contact and a request for her organs to be donated.  Kyal Sin tries to take cover with other protesters after police opened fire on an anti-coup demonstration in Mandalay. She was shot in the head. Photograph: Reuters  She was shot dead when police opened fire.  Kyal Sin was a talented and caring 19-year-old. She was skilled at taekwondo, a gifted dancer and quick-witted. A friend who protested alongside her told Reuters at the time that she had kicked open a water pipe at the rally, so that others could rinse teargas from their eyes.  A photograph of her at the rally that day – crouching forward, a pair of goggles slung around her neck to protect from teargas – was shared widely online, along with the words: “Everything will be OK.” Her image was immortalised in protest artwork.  She is one of many young women who have risked violence, and even given their lives, to fight for democracy. Other young women have joined the People’s Defence Force and other armed groups, taking up arms to protect their communities against military violence and to fight for justice in Myanmar.  The military has only become more brutal in its use of violence against the public, but she remains a symbol of courage and defiance.  Rebecca Ratcliffe is the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent  Weronika Strzyżyńska on Krystyna Kacpura, Poland  Abortion has never been fully accessible in Poland during my lifetime. I was born five years after the initial restrictions were introduced in 1992, and grew up in a family where, as earnest Catholics, we would tear up at the mention of the “murdered unborn”.  Being viscerally aware of the chokehold that anti-choice rhetoric has had on Polish society, the work of Krystyna Kacpura, a veteran of the Polish feminist movement, is particularly close to my heart.  Krystyna Kacpura, who helped lay the foundations for Poland’s feminist protest movement. Photograph: Courtesy of Sexual Rights Initiative  Kacpura has been involved in the movement from the very beginning. She was one of the first employees of the Federation for Women and Family Planning, which was set up in 1991. Abortion was still legally available on demand then, but it was clear that in the new Poland those rights were not a given. And as politicians and clergy discussed the “appropriate” limits of reproductive health, women’s voices were not heard or taken seriously.  But despite the series of setbacks that Polish women have experienced over the last three decades, Kacupura has worked tirelessly. Today, she is still taking phone calls from desperate women, offering them level-headed and clear advice that they will often not hear from their doctor. Her decades of work have laid the foundations for Poland’s feminist protest movement of today.  Weronika Strzyżyńska is a Guardian reporter  Febriana Firdaus on Eva Bande, Indonesia  As one of only a few female journalists investigating human rights and environmental issues in my country, I often ask myself: how long can I survive? Indonesia is experiencing devastating environmental destruction. As a female journalist, I also face gender discrimination and have to fight ideas that women belong in the kitchen, that women cannot lead.  I was considering giving up my job until I met Eva Bande. I was interviewing her for a documentary I was making. Bande has risen to lead social movements, including a group of farmers resisting a giant palm-oil plantation, owned by a powerful local elite. She has faced violence and imprisonment.  The environmental activist Eva Bande, centre, in Piondo, Sulawesi, in Indonesia. Photograph: Leo Plunkett/Mongabay  It is unusual to see a female leader and her spirit uplifted me. I witnessed her open a meeting with a group of farmers and saw that a woman can be a leader and a guardian of the forest. It was a turning point in my life. I wanted to be like her some day but, in my version, being an editor and leading a group of reporters to investigate environmental stories. It is a dream I am still working towards.  Febriana Firdaus is an independent investigative journalist based in Indonesia  Ruth Michaelson on Loujain al-Hathloul, Saudi Arabia  At the same time Saudi Arabia was pushing to vastly expand the small number of women in the workplace in 2018, it was also detaining a group of feminist activists who had demanded many of the very changes they were implementing.  One of them was Loujain al-Hathloul. Her only crime was spearheading a campaign for Saudi Arabian women to be allowed to drive. Hathloul put herself on the line, regularly and defiantly, for women who simply wanted the freedom to make basic choices about their own lives, including being able to drive a car without fear of arrest.  She put herself on the line for women who simply wanted the freedom to make basic choices about their own lives  She remained in prison until February last year, long enough that the kingdom had lessened or removed many of the restrictions on women that she had campaigned against. The ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia was lifted just a month after her arrest.  Hathloul’s prolonged detention – during which she testified she was tortured – was less about women driving, now commonplace in Saudi Arabia, but because she spoke out. Today, she remains banned from travelling outside the country for her activism, and banned from speaking to the media.

Photograph: Ahmed Yosri/Reuters  Hathloul’s inspiring influence on Saudi women, as well as feminists worldwide, is clear, which is why her words and work represent a lasting threat. The block on Hathloul speaking publicly is designed to prevent her from demanding more for the women of Saudi Arabia – because in the end, she will succeed.  Ruth Michaelson is a reporter based in Istanbul  Zeinab Mohammed Salih on Awadiya Mahmoud Koko, Sudan  Many Sudanese women are an inspiration to me, but I want to highlight Awadiya Mahmoud Koko, a tea seller who became a trade union leader, overcoming many obstacles in her personal life and work to do so.  As a young girl, Koko fled war in South Kordofan, her birthplace, to live in the capital, Khartoum, where she worked as a tea lady, a job traditionally done by women who fled the war in Darfur and the Nuba mountains. She faced enormous discrimination in the city due to where she came from.  Awadiya Mahmoud Koko, head of the Food and Tea Sellers Union, in Khartoum, Sudan in 2019. Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters  She has been arrested many times. Under the former president Omar al-Bashir, tea sellers were regularly harassed and arrested under public order laws. But she never gave up and went on to help form the first union for female tea sellers – a bold thing to do under Bashir’s government. She was heavily involved in the 2019 protests that led to his downfall.  I think of Koko whenever things look bleak or I think about giving up working as a journalist. Sudan places many restrictions on women from working-class backgrounds. She inspires many women here, especially those who come from the periphery of society, who look at her and believe that, one day, their hard work could be recognised.  Zeinab Mohammed Salih is a reporter based in Khartoum  Ashifa Kassam on Nilofar Bayat, Afghanistan and Spain  For years, Afghanistan’s female national wheelchair basketball team crisscrossed the globe, becoming a potent symbol of how women’s lives had been transformed in the country. But in August, as the Taliban swiftly retook power, silence descended on their home basketball court in the hills of Kabul.  The team’s captain, Nilofar Bayat, scrambled to leave the country. “There were so many videos of me playing basketball. I had been active in calling for women’s rights and the rights of women with disabilities,” the 28-year-old told me in August. “If the Taliban found out all of this about me, I knew they would kill me.”  Nilofar Bayat in Bilbao, Spain, where she now lives, having fled Afghanistan under Taliban rule, August 2021. Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP/Getty Images  Bayat and her husband, Ramesh Naik, were offered places on a wheelchair basketball team in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao. Six months on, they continue to grapple with the immense task of rebuilding their lives; there are daily Spanish lessons, endless amounts of bureaucracy to wade through and new teammates to gel with.  Even so, Bayat’s focus remains on the women of Afghanistan. A trained lawyer, she is now working to create an association, Free Women for Afghanistan, with the aim of providing support and international advocacy for women in Afghanistan, particularly those with disabilities.  Despite fears that her family in Afghanistan could become targets, Bayat has sought to give voice to the women the Taliban is seeking to erase, speaking to anyone who will listen about the situation on the ground. “People are forgetting the women and children who are the main victims of the war in Afghanistan,” she says.

It was always going to be difficult for South Korea to match the vitriol surrounding Park Geun-hye’s dramatic removal from office five years ago over corruption charges for which she would spend more than three years in prison.  But the campaign leading up to Wednesday’s election for the country’s next president has given even Park’s chaotic exit a run for its money.  The world’s 10th-biggest economy is likely to require a period of national reconciliation after weeks of rancour that some have likened to the hit South Korean Netflix series Squid Game, although no one is suggesting the price of failure will come via the barrel of a submachine gun.  Unlike the election’s 2017 iteration, when the left-leaning Moon Jae-in was swept into the presidential Blue House by an electorate enraged by Park’s abuse of power, this week’s vote is still too close to call.  A man wears a mask depicting Younghee, a doll from the Netflix series Squid Game, during a rally in Seoul. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP  After two years of the Covid-19 pandemic and rising disquiet over the cost of living – against a backdrop of a ferocious gender war – Moon’s Democratic party heir apparent, Lee Jae-myung, is behind in the polls.  The most recent survey, taken a week before Wednesday’s vote, put Yoon Suk-yeol, the conservative challenger from the People Power party, marginally ahead.  The ghosts of Park, the daughter of a former South Korean dictator who in 2012 was elected the country’s first female president, appeared early in the current campaign, when Yoon and his wife were accused of having ties to a shamanistic healer who, in return for advice, had been given a decision-making role.  The claims were particularly damaging for Yoon, who, ironically, had been part of the legal team that pursued Park after her impeachment: her downfall began with revelations that she had allowed a longtime friend, whose late father was the leader of an obscure religious cult, to influence policy.  For a while, some wondered if spiritualism was again going to help determine South Korea’s political future.  Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic party gestures to supporters in Seoul. Photograph: Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty  Park aside, Kim Dae-jung, who was elected in 1998, reportedly won after moving the location of his father’s grave on the advice of a shaman. Media reports claimed that if Yoon was elected, his wife would change the location of the Blue House’s guest accommodation, having been told to do so by a shaman.  They are not alone: Yoon Yeo-joon, a former environment minister, suggested it would be easier to count the number of South Korean politicians and business leaders who did not pick up the phone to a trusted shaman before making an important decision.  But by last month, the shamanism row dimmed, amid claims that senior figures in the Democratic party may also have been present at a ritual where Yoon and his wife were reportedly named as guests.  That did not give way to a more civilised campaign, however. Instead, it has been described as a revenge mission by conservatives still loyal to Park, who was pardoned late last year.  Officials set up a polling station in Gwangju on the eve of the presidential election. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA  “This year’s presidential election has been more overwhelmed by negative campaigning than any other previous election, and the mutual hatred won’t easily die down after the election,” said Choi Jin, the director of the Institute of Presidential Leadership in Seoul.  While voters demand action on skyrocketing house prices in Seoul, stagnant growth and youth unemployment, the two frontrunners have continued to trade insults and fend off allegations of impropriety.  Yoon accused Lee’s party of using the tactics of Hitler and Mussolini, while Lee’s allies described Yoon as a “dictator” and “an empty can”.  Lee, who is being scrutinised over a suspect land development deal, opened his campaign with an apology for a profanity-laden family phone call and has been dogged by rumours of links to organised crime.  Yoon, meanwhile, has made several gaffes, most recently a “tone deaf” – and now-deleted – tweet about Ukraine that included a tangerine with an angry face drawn on it in an apparent reference to the country’s 2004 Orange revolution.  The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper spoke for many South Korean when it questioned the candidates’ priorities. “Isn’t our national future too bleak with an unpleasant and bitter presidential election that calls for choosing the lesser of two evils?” it asked in a recent editorial.  Voters gather to listen to a speech by Lee Jae-myung during his campaign stop in the south-eastern port city of Busan. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA  Faced with an angry electorate, the worst coronavirus wave of the pandemic and a North Korea that has rediscovered its penchant for ballistic missile tests, it may be that political reality quickly supersedes campaign acrimony as the winner prepares to take office in early May.  Yet despite promises from Yoon and Lee during a recent TV debate not to launch politically motivated investigations against the defeated candidate, many fear the mud-slinging will continue long after the election.  “We now have an election race like Squid Game, but it will be the new president’s responsibility to pull us out of it,” said Cho Jinman, a professor at Duksung Women’s University in Seoul.

I just really love where I live and sharing that, along with a bit of sunshine and positivity.”  girlabout.co.uk, @alwaysswimmingwild  Omie Dale, swimming instructor, outdoor swim coach and director of Swimunity  Cold-water fan … Omie Dale  “What really drives the work I do is spreading the joy of swimming and the joy of being outdoors with others,” says Omie, who was named Swim England’s Swimming Teacher of the Year 2021.  Omie is a host for Mental Health Swims in London, a free monthly swim meet focused on cold-water immersion, and director of Swimunity, a community interest group that teaches swimming to children and women for free in London. Her work involves getting women and children out of London and into nature, and increasing diversity in the water, enabling people to swim who might not otherwise have taken it up.  “It’s about so much more than just swimming up and down in a pool for hours. Getting outdoors and combining swimming with hikes, beautiful scenery and aquatic activities such as paddle boarding helps get this message across.”  @swimunity, @omiedale  Rosie Swale Pope, adventurer, runner and author, who at the age of 75 is running from the UK to Kathmandu  Rosie Swale Pope crossing the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, in 2019. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Rosie has numerous impressive journeys under her belt, from sailing solo across the Atlantic to running 20,000 miles across the globe, unsupported and carrying her belongings in a cart she towed behind her, after the death of her husband in 2002. She detailed this in her 2009 book Just a Little Run Around the World.  Her current mission, to run from the UK to Kathmandu to raise money for Phase Worldwide’s community charity work in Nepal, has been hindered somewhat not by her age, but by recent events. Setting out in 2018, she reached northern Turkey before the pandemic forced her to return home. Not one to be thwarted, she set off again via a 1,000-mile training run in the UK to Norway, planning to reach Kathmandu via Finland, Russia and China. Illness and the current situation with Russia have just brought her home again. But she won’t be here for long, and her next attempt will be live-blogged on her website.  rosieswalepope.co.uk  Sophie Nicholson, skier and ski writer  Sophie Nicholson Photograph: Rachel Keenan/©Rachel Keenan  Yes, there are countless professional female skiers posting about their unbelievable tricks and extreme lines on the world’s gnarliest mountains. But what we like about Sophie Nicholson, a skier, runner and sports therapist, is her get up and go attitude and humorous social media posts about her solo adventuring into the backcountry of Scotland’s Cairngorms, where she lives.  Running along remote ridges and Highland hikes as well as carrying her skis on her bike to reach untouched Scottish powder feature heavily, along with some painful injury shots.  “When I was younger I really wanted to be a boy as I loved doing things like skateboarding, playing football, and building forts. Back then, gender lines were very traditional and defined.  “As I’ve grown up I’ve continued to make choices that sit slightly out of the mainstream but these days I’m so so happy that I am a woman! The ladies who I am lucky enough to call my friends make my heart swell with pride – whether they have families or are blazing the single trail, all of these women are so inspiring to me – they are capable, resilient, adventurous, kind, brave and loyal.”  @snicholson76  Tracy Edwards, sailor and founder of charitable foundation The Maiden Factor, which works to empower girls through education  Tracy Edwards and crewmate Mikaela Von Koskull in the Whitbread Round the World Race in 1989.

Tracy’s determination and skill in the face of sexism in the male-dominated yacht-racing world, and the power of the crew’s female friendships, will have you sobbing by the end, even if you’re a landlubber who gets seasick on canal boats.

Then came American Dirt. The Jeanine Cummins novel sold to a US publisher for a seven-figure advance, was chosen for Oprah’s Book Club, and was touted as “the new Grapes of Wrath”. On release in 2020, early readers noted that the white author’s depiction of Mexican people was, at best, flawed, inaccurate, and riddled with stereotypes and, at worst, simply racist.  A sensitivity reader is an additional editor who works alongside the publishing house staffer who acquired the rights to your book. This individual will conduct a very specific read of the manuscript, and offer notes on characters from marginalised groups, or elements which may cause offence. The argument goes that if American Dirt had been sufficiently scrutinised by a reader of Mexican heritage, some of the furore could have been avoided.  The publishing industry is split over the increased usage of sensitivity readers. Lionel Shriver said she would rather quit writing than have her work scrutinised. John Boyne tweeted: “No serious writer would ever allow their work to be so sanitised.” Kate Clanchy claimed sensitivity readers “sullied my memoir to suit their agenda”, and parted ways with the publisher who employed such professionals.  My background as an author is in young adult fiction, an area in which sensitivity readers are common, especially in the US, so I’m less fazed. I have also been a sensitivity reader, informally. An author friend asked if I’d read his manuscript to check if I felt he’d accurately depicted a transgender character. He mostly had; there were some quirks he’d got wrong, things that only someone who had gone through the grind of gender transition – like me – would be aware of.  I see my job as a giddy, creative game of make-believe in which I spend my office hours imagining what it’s like to be someone who isn’t me. I am a trans, 40-year-old woman from Bradford navigating life on the south coast of England, but I don’t want to exclusively write characters in my own demographic. Through my fiction, I’ve been a Time Lord; a Scot; a fashion model; an oligarch’s daughter and Bloody Mary. It’s all part of the job. However, when I’m writing a character who has experienced oppression, I need to take extra care. When writing my forthcoming adult debut, Her Majesty’s Royal Coven, I created a character called Leonie, a mixed-race woman from Leeds. The book is about magic and witchcraft, but it is also a story about women and feminism – and I felt it was odd to pretend race wasn’t an issue in the fictional coven. There were elements of Leonie that were very familiar to me. Like her, I’m from Yorkshire, I’m queer, and I’m an ambitious gobshite. Unlike Leonie, I am white.  So, to the surprise of my UK publisher, I petitioned to get a sensitivity reader. If I was to include Leonie in my book, I wanted to know I had done her, and myself, justice. My publishers agreed so I sent my manuscript to a sensitivity reader, herself a mixed-race woman, and I waited to hear her thoughts. My editor checked in with me to ensure I was ready to hear some things I might not want to hear. Of course, no one wants to think of themselves as bigoted, but if I’d inadvertently written something inaccurate or insulting, I’d much rather know while the book was a Word document and not on the shelves of bookstores. To me it was a no-brainer.  The reader’s notes came back and, I stress, I was under no obligation to make changes to the novel, but I did. It was the same sort of feedback I’d given my friend – I’d got a few tiny details wrong and, in one sequence, had actually been a bit snobby about a council estate, which is ironic because I was born on one. Unconscious bias strikes!  There is a bigger issue under the surface of all this. We wouldn’t need external editors if the in-house teams at UK publishers were more diverse. I have loved working with every single one of them, but the six UK editors I’ve had since 2011 have all been cisgender white women from (I’m guessing) quite comfortable backgrounds. Their big bosses, almost exclusively, have been cisgender white men.  I am starting to see a change, and that’s a good thing, but for now, I think sensitivity readers are here to stay, and I’d urge authors to welcome them into their process. After all, don’t we all want to release our book into the world safe in the knowledge it’s as rigorously edited as it can be?  The final word goes to Society of Authors chair, and author, Joanne Harris: “It takes courage for an author to admit they may not have all the answers. (Note: Dickens changed his depiction of Jews after corresponding with one of his Jewish critics, who pointed out antisemitism in Oliver Twist.) In later years, he also went through the text and revised it quite heavily, removing more than 200 of the more extreme antisemitic references, to the disappointment of some of his more antisemitic readers. He showed the capacity to grow. Perhaps that’s what makes a great writer.”

And it’s something we’ve seen a lot with doomspreading prophecies that Donald Trump is going to run for president or even win in 2024.  One of the assumptions is that Trump will still be alive and competent to run, but the health of this sedentary shouter in his mid-70s, including the after-effects of the Covid-19 he was hospitalised for in 2020, could change.  Look to external issues too, for whatever the condition of his own health, his financial health is under attack, with businesses losing money and some banks refusing to lend to him after the storming of the Capitol.  It’s also worth remembering that he lost the popular vote by millions in 2016 and by more millions in 2020; he never had a mandate. The Republicans are clearly gearing up to try to steal an election again, but their chances of winning one with Trump as candidate seem slim. Currently, he is creating conflict within the Republican party with his insistence on controlling it for his own agenda and punishing dissenters.  Another assumption we make when we assess Trump’s prospects is that he won’t be locked up in 2024, or that his reputation, such as it is, won’t be severely damaged even in the eyes of some who voted for him before. Even in the past couple of weeks his standing has shifted significantly. Former attorney general Bill Barr is now speaking up – to promote his book – about how Trump was clearly advised that his claims of election theft had no basis and that his strategies to overturn the results were illegal. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has woken up people around the world (or at least those who were dozing) to Vladimir Putin’s malevolence and reminded Americans of how eagerly Trump allied himself with the Russian dictator, personally and politically. Suddenly a lot of Republicans are trying to scurry away from their own pro-Putin record, which may mean distancing themselves from Trump as well. His 2019 withholding of military aid to Ukraine to try to pressure Ukrainian president Zelenskiy into supporting his lies is also being re-examined under the harsh light of this war.  Additionally, Trump is facing many criminal charges, from allegations of financial dirty dealing by the Trump Organization in New York (Trump has called the various probes into the business “politically motivated”), to an investigation into whether Trump and his allies subverted election results in Georgia, where Trump claims election fraud took place. Just last week, the January 6 committee laid out a series of potential charges against the ex-president, including conspiracy to defraud the American people and obstructing an official proceeding of Congress. Trump’s domestic status seems to be shifting rapidly. He is also facing so many lawsuits that both CNN and NBC published indexes of the cases. Last month news broke that Trump had left the White House with classified documents, which he claimed he had a right to take to his home. That could be a felony, though how much appetite the Biden administration has for jailing a former president remains to be seen.  Among the large array of civil charges Trump faces are E Jean Carroll’s allegations of defamation over his insult-laden denial that he raped her (he has responded that he was simply responding in the line of “official duties”) and former consigliere Michael Cohen’s case that his return to prison was triggered by Trump after Cohen released a revealing memoir. There are also suits holding Trump responsible for the January 6 insurrection both from members of Congress, and two policemen injured in the mayhem. In February the courts ruled that these civil suits can go forward, and Trump lacks the immunity that would protect him from them. Trump has initiated lawsuits of his own, but a great many have been dismissed, although he is still suing his niece, Mary Trump, for disclosing tax information about him. She in turn is suing him and two of his siblings, alleging that they defrauded her out of much of her inheritance (which they deny).  Though the 14th amendment of the US constitution should ban all insurrectionists from running for elected office, it seems unlikely to be applied to 21st-century candidates the way it was to former Confederates. But still, the Georgia and New York charges are serious. All of which is to say that the road from early 2022 to late 2024 is bumpy for Trump. Popular opinion is fickle; George W Bush is Trump’s age and clearly a permanent has-been. Even Barack Obama, at 60, has strolled offstage.  But even if Trump is not indisputably in the running, Trumpism is running rampant, and it’s a force to contend with in political races across the US. Trump was a super-spreader of his brand of amoral self-interest that tramples fact, truth, law and rights. The man himself is sulking in his private club in Florida – enduring effectual exile from New York, Washington – and Twitter – but to a degree, his work is done. He has got an already corrupt political party to embrace his tactics and values. The brazen lies of prominent figures in the party show that they’ve abandoned all ethics and standards, and will happily violate the oaths they took to uphold the constitution. Viral Trumpism has already merged with conspiracy theories such as QAnon, with anti-vaccine cults, with white supremacists and neo-fascists, and with the gun-fetishising groups that continue to have an ominous presence in public life.  I sometimes think of the American right as a pot on the boil; what’s inside is concentrating as it shrinks. The Republican party seems to be losing ground: a Gallup poll from January found that 24% of eligible voters considered themselves Republican, down from 31% in November 2021. That’s a reminder that news stories revealing that a majority of Republicans believe something could actually mean that only a small minority of Americans do.  There have been high-profile defections and general atrophy in the age of Trump. That’s the shrinking. But then there’s the concentration that renders those who remain more furious, more closed-minded, more ready to jump on any bandwagon that looks as if it leads to power, and even more rigidly committed to an increasingly rightwing agenda, even though – or maybe because – that means minority rule.  For progressives, Republican desperation is a good sign, in its way. A popular party doesn’t have to suppress votes and steal elections. A party aligned with the will of the people doesn’t need to lie and cheat. Trumpism seems like a last gasp, a desperate last chance to hang on to what’s slipping away. The old Soviet-satellite aphorism “You can cut down the flowers but you can’t stop the spring” applies nicely.  The future of this country is white-minority. Yet the Republican party has done its best to alienate everybody else, while the rising majority of Americans support reproductive rights, climate action and many economic justice measures. The long-term progressive future of the United States seems almost inevitable. But with Trumpism still a force, the short-term future is alarming and unpredictable, and the damage may be lasting; whether it’s the prevention of climate action or the infliction of literal and financial violence on poor and marginalised people.  Enemies of authoritarianism and white supremacy have their work cut out, but the task is clear and straightforward: to protect the democratic process, upholding voting rights and free and fair elections, to try to win those elections for progressive candidates, and to articulate and defend the values behind those objectives.  Trump is treading water, but this is how resistance to Trumpism works, and how it can prevail if enough people work at it hard enough.  Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

While the sentiment is understandable, we need a strong dose of reality to curb some of the more emotional impulses which, taken too far, could not only fail to make our country safer – but result in the US stumbling into a catastrophic war that can be avoided.  The war between Russia and Ukraine started horribly and has only intensified since. Kharkiv has been devastated by heavy Russian bombardment. The port city of Mariupol could fall to Russian forces any moment, and vicious street fighting gets closer to the heart of Kyiv by the day. Accurate casualty figures are as yet unknown, but they are significant for the Ukrainian civil population. The reaction from the western world against Moscow has been immediate and severe.  Russia has seen the most punitive and comprehensive set of sanctions levied against another country since the second world war. Moscow has been almost entirely cut off from the Swift banking system. News organizations around the world have ceased operations there and curtailed Russian media outlets in the west. Businesses the world over have suspended operations in the country. All of the measures have taken a serious toll on the Russian population.  To date, however, none of it has had any discernable impact on Putin’s prosecution of the war, as his military machine continues its march through Ukraine. That apparent lack of success has many in the west contemplating the imposition of even harsher measures to punish Moscow with the eventual hope of forcing Putin to end the war and withdraw his troops.  While it is entirely reasonable and appropriate to impose a serious cost on Russia for their grossly unnecessary war of choice, the west must stop to consider the ramifications of its policies before taking further action. If we let emotion have too much sway in our next steps, we could perversely worsen, materially, the West’s collective security.  Some of the options under consideration from various quarters include not just sending Kyiv more arms and ammunition, but increasingly sophisticated weapons such as air defense systems, modern fighter jets, and more advanced missile systems. The governments of some European countries, such as Sweden and the UK, have not prevented their citizens and military veterans from going to Ukraine to fight the Russians. But the most dangerous idea being given increasing consideration is the establishment of a no-fly zone over Kyiv.  No less than three retired four-star American generals, all former Nato supreme allied commanders, have given some degree of support to the idea of a no-fly zone in Ukraine. One of them, General Philip Breedlove, proposed a no-fly zone for humanitarian purposes, suggesting it might be tolerable to Moscow if the US says “we are not going to fire on you unless you fire on us”.  Such distinctions are obviously pointless: if we enforce the zone, then by definition we have to shoot down anything that flies into it, whether it attacks our planes or not. And if anyone had any doubts about what Russia’s response would be to one of its jets being destroyed in a no-fly zone, Putin put them to rest on Friday when he said he would consider any attack in Russian aviation to be an attack on his country and respond in kind.  President Zelenskiy has been outspoken in urging Nato to ignore this danger and impose a no-fly zone regardless of Putin’s comments. On Friday, he tried to shame Nato into the move by saying the alliance leaders would be responsible for Ukrainian deaths if they didn’t intervene on his behalf. “All the people who will die from this day will die because of you,” Zelensky said, accusing the alliance of “weakness” and “disunity.”  The west must resolutely refuse to be drawn into the war through the Ukrainian leader’s emotional appeal  While Zelensky’s desire is understandable – his nation is under vicious attack – the west must resolutely refuse to be drawn into the war through the Ukrainian leader’s emotional appeal. As bad as it is that millions are suffering in Ukraine, western leaders have obligations, first and foremost, to safeguard their populations. Fighting Russia on behalf of Zelensky would expose the populations of the entire alliance to potential attack by Moscow, which could escalate to nuclear warfare.  It is crucial the west does not overreact to the war, as bad as it is. The sanctions currently in place are unprecedented in their severity and will impose a penalty on Putin that it could take upwards of a decade from which to fully recover. Moreover, regardless of how the war ends, Putin’s military is going to be severely weakened in the aftermath. Because of the strong sanctions, it would likely take Putin over a decade to rebuild Russia’s military strength to its pre-war position – which has been exposed as being far weaker than most imagined – much less to be capable of invading a Nato country.  Meanwhile, because Putin has shown he is willing to use force, virtually every European country is now going to significantly increase its defense spending and put real emphasis on modernizing their own self-defense capacity, as evidenced by Berlin’s $113bn investment in its defense budget.  The bottom line is that if Nato remains resolute and sober in its response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, refuses to get drawn into a no-win war, western security for the foreseeable future will be strengthened. Let our emotions get the best of us, however, and risk widening the war, and we may suffer far more harm than anything that has yet befallen Ukraine.

I went along with two 12-year-olds and made all the promises you have to make to get two preteens to go anywhere with you (it won’t take long and it’s near an Itsu).  Instead, we found a modest Stop the War rally with not a viola in sight – just Jeremy Corbyn speaking from a makeshift stage. “He just said: ‘War is bad because it kills people,’” my kid summarised – then, witheringly: “And this is your icon?” I explained that you don’t go to a demo for an original hypothesis. This was my entire childhood, standing in a crowd, listening to why war is bad, and so is poll tax. Also, “icon” is way too strong a word for my feelings about Corbyn, although I am glad to see him back in his happy place, saying determined, uncomplicated things to a small crowd.  There were some homemade signs, but two banners centrally produced, one uncontroversial: “No to Nuclear War.” The other was more problematic, drawing an elliptical but discernible equivalence between Putin’s aggression and Nato’s “expansion”, by saying “no” to both. This was quite complicated.  They say you only discover how well you understand something when you try to explain it to someone else; when the someone else is a scathing preteen, you discover it faster. I can lay out the criticism of Stop the War easily enough – that its anti-Americanism is so vehement, it amounts to pro-almost-anything-else, from Assad to Putin. What I couldn’t do was explain what that meant for pacifism generally. Had the entire case against war been hollowed out? Is everyone who has ever been on a Stop the War rally discredited? Realistically, given the strength of popular opposition to the Iraq war, isn’t that almost all of us? Would I get kicked out of the Labour party for being in Trafalgar Square at all? Well no, obviously: I was looking for Mussorgsky, on my way to an Itsu.

On Sunday evening, the newly minted Richards-Botham Trophy was unveiled by the two cricketing titans who made their first class Somerset debuts together in 1974, shared an apparently riotous flat in Taunton and have been like brothers ever since. Richards, 70 on Monday, remains in incredible physical nick, as if he could swagger out to the middle this week with gum in mouth and bat in hand ready to strike the fear of God into his opponents; Ian Botham, four years younger but fuller in figure and with the hobbling gait of an old bowler, would probably still back himself. When has he ever not?  Their fortunes during past battles may see some quibble here. Richards dominated England back in the day, a Test average of 62 against them his highest of all teams faced, but Botham fared less well against the great West Indies team he rates as the best in history. But the renaming of the trophy – if slightly unnecessary given the backstory of the Wisden Trophy and Learie Constantine’s involvement – is about a celebration of friendship between cricket in the Caribbean and England.  This was certainly in evidence two years ago when West Indies unflinchingly answered English cricket’s SOS, flying their Test team to the UK during the height of the pandemic. The players took a 50% pay cut to help out a board that struggles financially during the good times, let alone when the world has stopped, and the conditions they met were unprecedented.  It involved a tour spent in restrictive biosecure bubbles at a time when no vaccine for Covid-19 existed. Reticence would have been understandable – indeed, three players opted out – but those who made the trip were impeccable, uncomplaining guests who pulled off a handsome win in the first Test and led the way for other international teams, including their women’s side, to follow.  By helping to get the TV money flowing they saved the England and Wales Cricket Board from catastrophe. This debt of gratitude is the reason why the latest encounter, originally slated for two Tests and three Twenty20s, has been fleshed out to three Tests plus the five Twenty20s that took place a few weeks ago.  As such, regular grumbles from aficionados about the use of more tourist-friendly islands – Antigua, Barbados and Grenada – and the growing absences from the traditional territories of Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad should probably be parked for now. If this schedule is deemed to generate the most money for Cricket West Indies, a board currently $23m (£17.5m) in debt, then who are the visitors to say otherwise? Even if CWI hits its target of $70m in revenues this year, it is still a fraction of the £207m they helped the ECB secure in 2020-21.  Judging by the tour’s first week in Antigua, the estimated 5,000 travelling fans (with more expected in Barbados) will be welcome. The tourism industry is slowly coming back to life on the island but a good number of businesses have not survived the ill-wind of the pandemic and there are empty hotels starting to be overtaken by foliage rather than Britons and North Americans with bulging wallets.  Joe Root prepares for the first Test against West Indies at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images  Resilience is the hallmark of the region, however, and cricket-wise this has been needed. The regional four-day competition has only just returned after a two-year absence but though West Indies are languishing in eighth place in the Test rankings, they represent a stiff challenge for an England side that sit below them in the World Test Championship ladder (AKA rock bottom) and are trying to shake off a seven-week Ashes postmortem and reboot Joe Root’s captaincy.  History says as much, with England claiming one series win in the Caribbean from 10 since 1968. Three years ago, they were completely overwhelmed by a four-pronged pace attack in Barbados and Antigua for a convincing series defeat only mildly offset by a dead-rubber win in St Lucia with Jason Holder, then captain, banned for a slow over-rate and Mark Wood delivering a breakthrough spell of searing pace.  There remain concerns over the home side’s batting but Kraigg Brathwaite, who has taken over as captain, comes into the series in form after a career-best 276 versus Jamaica last month. Holder is a world-class all-rounder, Kemar Roach is 19 wickets away from becoming the sixth West Indian to 250, while in Jayden Seales, the 20-year-old Trinidadian, they possess a hugely promising quick who serves as a reminder of how verdant the Caribbean remains talent-wise.  There is a good deal of local surprise England have deemed the elite standards of Anderson and Broad to be surplus to requirements. Richards said he was amazed the pair were left out of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane and figured there must be serious talent coming through. Now, Antigua’s most famous son believes his old team have a “wonderful opportunity” in their absence, describing England as “a little bit flat”.  Root’s attack – most likely Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Wood and Jack Leach initially, with Ollie Robinson yet again unfit – must therefore prove this prediction wrong, while a rejigged batting order with Alex Lees making his debut as opener has an initial target of passing 300 for the first time this winter. But whatever the outcome and any repercussions that follow, friendship should be the overriding theme of this tour.

The decision not to show games in Russia, which relates to a deal with Rambler (Okko Sport), was made at a shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday. It had been expected after the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last Thursday the situation was under review.  “The league strongly condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” a statement said. “We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those impacted. The £1m donation will be made to the Disasters Emergency Committee to deliver humanitarian aid directly to those in need.”  The league showed solidarity with Ukraine across the most recent round of matches, including with captains wearing yellow and blue armbands and big screens displaying ‘Football Stands Together’ on the same colours.  The Football Association has suspended its partnership with Russian  broadcasters over rights for the FA Cup, PA Media has reported. The quarter-final ties are due to take place on 19 and 20 March.

The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “This is absolutely the right thing to do and we fully support the Premier League’s decision to stop broadcasting matches in Russia in response to Putin’s barbaric, senseless invasion of Ukraine. Russia cannot be allowed to legitimise its illegal war through sport and culture, and we must work together to ensure Putin remains a pariah on the international stage.”

Annie Kelly and Lorenzo Tondo explain what this growing refugee crisis looks like. Plus, a couple who fled for Hungary share their journey  Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine. The UN high commissioner for refugees is calling it the fastest growing refugee crisis since the second world war. The human rights journalist Annie Kelly tells Hannah Moore that the UNHCR estimates that more than 4 million people will become refugees as a result of this conflict.  So far, most are heading west into Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary – all of which have opened their borders to Ukrainian nationals in a heartwarming show of support. Lorenzo Tondo, who has been reporting from Ukraine’s border with Poland, says the difference between the response to these refugees and the response refugees fleeing Iraq, Syria and Yemen were met with has been stark.  He has also reported on the pushback and racial discrimination faced by African, south Asian and Middle Eastern residents of Ukraine trying to flee. But even those who make it out of Ukraine safely – such as Katia Zabello and her British partner, Peter Cribley, who live in Kyiv – face a maze of bureaucratic immigration hurtles.

The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion.  They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership.  In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed.  Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend.  Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border.  It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000.  For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack  Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far?  Putin: pursuing an old Soviet glory? Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Vladimir Putin  The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded.  A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema.  Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy.  Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia.  More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep.  Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas.  At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word.  Joe Biden: a message to China as well as to Russia. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  Joe Biden  The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster.  Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state.  Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan.  Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move.  Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.  Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution.  Zelenskiy: under pressure to go slowly on Nato membership. Photograph: Reuters  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine’s president impressed world leaders in the Munich security conference this weekend with a brave and punchy speech after ignoring warnings to stay at home for fear of a Russian-inspired coup attempt. His response to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put.  One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides.  Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s.  True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force.  Scholz and Macron: soft line and hard line? Photograph: Getty Images  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz  Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises.  These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war.  Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front.  While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions.  Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights.  That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach.  The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far.  Johnson (right, with Zelenskiy): errand boy for America? Photograph: Getty Images  Boris Johnson  Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it.  At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally.  The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid.  But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff.  Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London.  All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America.  When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.

The study found that sticking to six specific commitments – from flying no more than once every three years to only buying three new items of clothing a year – could rein in the runaway consumption that is partially driving the climate crisis.  The research carried out by academics at Leeds University and analysed by experts at the global engineering firm Arup and the C40 group of world cities, found that making the six commitments could account for a quarter of the emissions reductions required to keep the global heating down to 1.5C.  The study was published on Monday alongside the launch of a new climate movement to persuade and support relatively well off people to make “The Jump” and sign up to the six pledges.  Tom Bailey, co-founder of the campaign said: “This ends once and for all the debate about whether citizens can have a role in protecting our earth. We don’t have time to wait for one group to act, we need ‘all action from all actors now’.”  Last week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its “bleakest warning yet”, saying the climate crisis was accelerating rapidly with only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages.  Founder Tom Bailey speaks at the Jump event in Guilford. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer  Timeline Half a century of dither and denial – a climate crisis timeline Show Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s 1959 The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” 1965 Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” 1970 Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. 1977 A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. 1981 An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. 1988 The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” 2 January 1988 A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. 1989 Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. 1990 Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. 1991 Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. 1992 At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” 1997 Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” 1998 The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. 2009 The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. 1 January 2013 A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. 1 January 2016 The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. 1 January 2017 Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. 2019 Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  Bailey said as the world reaches the edge of ecological collapse, it needed a workable alternative to this ‘universal consumer society’ in the next decade.  “The research is clear that governments and the private sector have the largest role to play but it is also equally clear from our analysis that individuals and communities can make a huge difference.”  The Jump campaign asks people to sign up to take the following six “shifts” for one, three or six months:  Eat a largely plant-based diet, with healthy portions and no waste  Buy no more than three new items of clothing per year  Keep electrical products for at least seven years  Take no more than one short haul flight every three years and one long haul flight every eight years  Get rid of personal motor vehicles if you can – and if not keep hold of your existing vehicle for longer  Make at least one life shift to nudge the system, like moving to a green energy, insulating your home or changing pension supplier  The campaign was officially kicked off on Saturday and Bailey said there was already a growing movement emerging in response to the evidence with Jump groups up and running around the country.  05:33 Indigenous activists on tackling the climate crisis: 'We have done more than any government' – video  “This is not just new information, or a normal behaviour change ‘campaign’, but a fun movement that is working to go way beyond the usual ‘greenie’ suspects,” said Bailey. “A movement that is able to engage all types of people … engaging and being led by communities of colour and the economically excluded.”  Bailey said there has been a widespread belief in climate circles in recent years that individual action was relatively ineffective and the only option was to get out on the streets and demand system change from governments and corporations.  “Obviously this is still hugely important but what this research shows is that there is a role for a new joyful climate movement which can help lead the way to less stuff and more joy.”  Some of the shifts the campaign calls for are, at least partially, dependent on systemic change – the prohibitive cost of train fares might leave individuals with little choice but to use short haul flights for essential journeys; public transport maybe expensive or nonexistent in areas of the country, leaving people with no choice but to use their car.  Bailey was the lead author of Labour’s plan to decarbonise the UK’s energy sector at the last election. He has worked in the green energy sector in the UK, US and China for the past 15 years, and said individual actions could have a cascade effect, leading to community level action and ultimately contributing to systemic change.  Although not everyone would be able to commit to all the pledges, just “making a start” could have a big impact, he said.  Jump co-organiser Marvina Newton and participants form discussion groups. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer  “This isn’t going back to the stone age, it’s just finding a balance. Less consuming in relatively rich western countries can mean more creativity, comedy, connection … Live for joy, not for stuff.”  The research is based on a study by academics at Leeds University, Arup and the C40 group of leading cities which assesses the impact of consumption by people in the world’s leading cities.  Analysis of that data has found that six steps set out above could cut global emissions by between 25% and 27%.  Ben Smith, director of climate change at Arup, who led the analysis said that as scientific evidence mounts, it was clear that all sections of society had to act.  “Our research shows that all of us, from politicians, city and business leaders to individual citizens, have important roles to play. And it is clear there’s lots that we can do as individuals, and that this is one of the easiest and quickest places to start”.

In an address on Russian state television, Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said: “A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market”, and claimed the price of oil could rise to more than US$300 a barrel.  Novak cited Germany’s decision last month to halt the certification of Nord Stream 2, a secondary pipeline, saying: “We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.”  He claimed it would be impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market. “It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers. Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome,” he said.  Analysts at Bank of America have said prices could reach US$200 a barrel if most of Russia’s exports were cut off, and oil prices hit near 14-year highs on Tuesday, with Brent crude futures reaching as high as $125.19 a barrel.  Novak’s threat refers to the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany and follows comments by the European Commission’s climate policy chief that the EU could wean itself off Russian gas within years and start curbing its reliance within months.  “It’s not easy, but it’s feasible,” Frans Timmermans told the European parliament’s environment committee on Monday. Russia supplies about 40% of Europe’s gas.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered energy security concerns and the European Commission will on Tuesday propose plans to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy.  Joe Biden held a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain on Monday as he pushed for their support to ban Russian oil imports. The US was however willing to move ahead without its European allies, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, revealed the idea was gaining traction in the White House and had been the subject of “very active discussion”. Boris Johnson attracted criticism after saying the UK may have to increase its domestic gas and oil production.  In other developments:  Ukrainian intelligence claimed that a Russian general has died in fighting around Kharkiv, the second such officer killed in a week. It broadcast what it said was a conversation between Russian FSB officers discussing the death of Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, and complaining that their secure communications no longer functioned inside Ukraine.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rallied the nation in a fresh late-night video address, saying that “heroic” resistance was making the war “like a nightmare” for Russia. Taking viewers on a tour of his quarters in Kyiv, he promised to stay in the capital until the war was won.  Several children were killed by Russian bombing in Sumy, according to the region’s military administration chief.  The humanitarian crisis continued to deepen, with 1.7 million Ukrainians thought to have fled the fighting, with the potential for the total to reach 5 million, the EU said. The UN human rights office has reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the number was a vast undercount.  Zelenskiy is to address UK MPs on Tuesday via video link and is expected to plead for more arms and a no-fly zone over Ukraine to be enforced by Nato.  Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, claimed the prospects of the country joining the EU had greatly increased, according to Ukraine’s Unian website. The distance to EU membership had been as far away as the moon last week, but was now only from Kyiv to the city of Vinnitsa – a distance of just 262km or 162 miles, he said.  Fresh talks between Ukraine and Russia are expected, after a third round ended without agreement on the evacuation of civilians via humanitarian corridors, although a Ukrainian negotiator said small progress had been made. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Vladimir Putin of “moral and political cynicism” and hypocrisy for making promises to protect civilians so they could flee only to Russia.  A draft of the European Commission’s energy plan, seen by Reuters, suggests increasing gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from other countries, and phasing in alternative gases such as hydrogen and biomethane.  Other elements would aim to build wind and solar projects faster, and ensure countries fill gas storage before winter to cushion supply shocks. Europe’s gas storage needs to be 80-90% full ahead of next winter, Timmermans said. Storage levels were about 75% as of the end of September last year.  The International Energy Agency has said Europe could reduce Russian gas imports by more than half within a year, but that would require a raft of rapid measures, from swapping gas boilers for heat pumps, to significantly raising LNG imports.  EU leaders may agree at a summit this week to phase out the bloc’s dependency on imports of Russian fossil fuels, without a fixed date, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters. Countries are divided, however, about whether to impose immediate sanctions on energy supplies against Russia. Germany, the biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, has rejected the idea.

The companies have been criticised for their failure to speak out about the invasion, and for continuing to operate in Russia, while a host of other firms such as Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry and Ikea have halted business in the country.  #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola have been trending on Twitter since the weekend. Other western food and drink chains including Starbucks, KFC and Burger King are also still operating in Russia.  The American actor and film-maker Sean Penn urged Americans on Twitter to boycott Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and McDonald’s until the companies suspend their operations in Russia. Core Response, the nonprofit group he founded in 2010 in response to the Haiti earthquake, is on the ground in Poland helping Ukrainian refugees.  Until Coca-Cola, PepsiCo & McDonalds suspend business in Russia, American citizens have a very safe & simple way to stand with Ukraine. Any among us can suspend our purchases of their products & ask our friends to consider doing the same.  https://t.co/OGNPJRCjrQ — Sean Penn (@SeanPenn) March 7, 2022  In the UK, the Dragons’ Den investor Deborah Meaden has also urged consumers to boycott the fizzy drinks giant Coca-Cola.  Can you stop drinking Coca Cola please. They are refusing to withdraw from Russia. Let’s show them some people power. — Deborah Meaden 🇺🇦 (@DeborahMeaden) March 4, 2022  Nicholas Christakis, a professor of social and natural science at Yale, has similarly condemned Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.  These companies, @CocaCola & @McDonalds, should be ashamed to engage in commercial interactions in a state that has invaded its neighbor, with much death as a result. https://t.co/GLSADDX8ge #BoycottMcDonalds #BoycottCocaCola — Nicholas A. Christakis (@NAChristakis) March 7, 2022  According to its website, McDonald’s had 847 outlets in Russia at the end of last year, the vast majority of which are operated directly by the company, as well as 108 restaurants in Ukraine. Starbuck’s, KFC and Pizza Hut are mostly run by franchisees in Russia.  One of Coca-Cola’s bottling companies, Coca-Cola HBC, announced last week it had paused production at its factory in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and evacuated employees.  McDonald’s and Pepsi, which have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also come under pressure from the boss of New York state’s pension fund.  Thomas DiNapoli, the comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote to both companies to urge them to review their businesses in Russia because they faced “significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks”, Reuters reported.  Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also called out the two multinationals, when he told CNN two days ago that “all western companies must withdraw from Russia” on humanitarian grounds. “We were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s remain in Russia and continue providing their products.”  However, Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald’s and Coca Cola were “very complicated businesses”, which did not make it easy to quit Russia. She told the BBC’s Today programme that Coca-Cola had an “incredibly complicated structure” with bottling plants in Russia.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  “I don’t think it’s as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,” she said. “These are complicated businesses and there’s a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward.”  Meanwhile, Swedish flatpack furniture giant Ikea temporarily closed all stores and factories across Russia last week, affecting 15,000 workers, while Germany’s Volkswagen stopped production of vehicles there, and Diageo, which makes Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, said it had paused exports to Russia and Ukraine.  McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have been contacted by the Guardian for comment.

Diplomatic efforts to evacuate them and create a safe corridor appear to have stalled.  Many of the students have run out of water, resorting at times to boiling ice, and are running out of food. In their desperation, many are contemplating taking a treacherous journey out of the city to Poltava, 110 miles to the south.  Ukrainian soldiers have warned students who have tried to leave to stay in the hostels. The journey passes dangerously close to the fighting on the outskirts of Sumy. Yet some students have felt they had no choice.  Last Thursday Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student in his 20s, and three of his friends paid a driver $1,600 (£1,220), several times the usual fee, and fled.  “My heart was pounding, I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to leave. The main route to the city had been bombed, the train station had been bombed. But we finally heard that there was another route through the forests,” he said.  “That day the driver just called me to say that he’s in front of the hostel. I hadn’t showered, I hadn’t brushed my teeth, my luggage wasn’t packed. I basically left everything, I just packed my documents and we started running down to the car.”  At checkpoints controlled by Ukrainian soldiers, the driver told troops he was taking the students to a safety zone close to the outskirts of the city.  “Then, when we started getting to the outskirts everything looked so much more real. There were destroyed armoured tanks, destroyed buses. Stains of blood everywhere on the ground. Cars that were mashed up, like armoured tanks drove over them.  “There was a burial, by some soldiers. I couldn’t tell which soldiers they were but they were burying someone.”  Footage filmed by Oluwaseun Adefemi as he and his friends sped through the forest, avoiding main roads, to escape from Sumy. Photograph: Oluwaseun Adefemi  Then they drove, speeding through the snow-covered forest, parallel to main roads to Poltova that were not safe to drive on.  “At times you could see the main roads through the forest. We saw armoured tanks, soldiers delivering weapons. Sometimes we saw that they were Ukrainians, because they had a band around their arm in the colour of their flag.  “Sometimes we saw young people, 18, 19, 20 years old, holding guns, ready to fight. We didn’t follow routes where we thought the Russians were. I was 80 or 90% sure that if they saw us we would be shot on sight.”  Adefemi’s driver was a 36-year-old Ukrainian. “He was tense. It was obvious he was afraid. He was going at outrageous speeds. The ground was covered in snow, he was trying to keep the car in control while speeding.”  For large spells of the journey they lost network and were “driving blind” through forestry.  After two hours of driving, they finally reached a nearby city where things felt calmer. “We wound down the windows. He played music, something Ukrainian. He relaxed, the speed reduced, he looked calm. We were getting close to Poltava.”  The following day Adefemi travelled to the Hungarian border and on Sunday he arrived in Budapest, where he is staying with a relative. The journey felt like an “impossible mission” he said, with several points where it felt they could be speeding into military conflict.”  ‘We are stuck’  Renish Joseph, from Kerala, India, is a student coordinator at Sumy State University and has lived in Ukraine for 10 years. He is currently sheltering in the university hostel with his Ukrainian wife and their two-month-old baby. He said there had been no running water in the hostel for days and tensions were running high.  “Things are bad here, tomorrow will be our 15th day,” said Joseph. “These are students who are just 17 or 18 years old, this is the first time in their lives they are facing anything like this situation. This war comes after two years of dealing with Covid so physically and mentally the students are very depressed and very tired.  “Every day they’re hoping that today they will be evacuated and then when it doesn’t happen, they’re getting more and more depressed and losing all hope. Some students have started experiencing bad psychological problems. At night, they will start crying or pacing around.”  With no running water for drinking, showers or toilets, Joseph said the students were reliant on volunteers who came into the hostel every day with thousands of litres of water. “The students are collecting it in water bottles and using it for everything, drinking and personal hygiene. It’s desperate.”  He said they went out for food early in the mornings but had to queue for hours outside supermarkets in freezing temperatures and food supplies inside stores were running low.  So far, Jospeh said fighting had remained on the peripheries of Sumy and was not in the city, but he was concerned that a perception among locals that foreign students may be wealthy could put them at risk.  “Everybody has a gun and we are worried because we are foreigners with brown skin so we are very visible and so anything can happen to us,” he said.  “We are safe for now but we have heard that looting has already started so I don’t think we will be safe here much longer.”  While the Indian government have announced an evacuation plan to get the students out via the polish border town of Poltava, which is around 150 miles away, and told them to be “ready at short notice”, so far it has been too dangerous to implement. Speaking at the UN security council meeting on Monday, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative at the UN, said that India was “deeply concerned that despite our repeated urgings” to both Russia and Ukraine, the “safe corridor for our students stranded in Sumy did not materialise.”  “There are only four to five routes which we can leave the city and all are blocked by fighting,” said Joseph. “The Russian border is only 40km [25 miles] away, but we cannot travel to Russia because Ukrainians will not allow it. So we are stuck.”

A day after Ukraine made its formal application for EU membership on Wednesday, Georgia responded to the pressure of overwhelming public protests and made its own request, along with Moldova.  In 2008 Vladimir Putin ordered a Russian invasion of Georgia in a campaign that killed hundreds of Georgians, displaced more than 190,000 and resulted in the Russian occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which continues to this day.  By signing the formal application for EU membership on Thursday, the Georgian prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, moved up the original timetable, under which Georgia’s application for EU membership would start in 2024.  Only on Tuesday, the chair of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Irakli Kobakhidze, had told journalists that speeding up Georgia’s application to the EU “could be counterproductive because we have to satisfy certain terms over the [next] two years”.  The Georgian government had also previously announced that it would not join international voices calling for sanctions against Russia. “I want to state clearly and unambiguously, considering our national interests and interests of the people, Georgia does not plan to participate in the financial and economic sanctions, as this would only damage our country and populace more,” Garibashvili said last week.  Since then, the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, has seen nightly protests, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in a show of solidarity with Ukraine and to call for Garibashvili’s resignation over what they consider a weak response to Russian aggression.  The Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Georgia of “holding an immoral position regarding sanctions” and recalled the Ukrainian ambassador to Georgia.  Founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream party is widely criticised for presiding over corruption, democratic backsliding and harbouring sympathy for Russian policies. Its reluctance to impose sanctions against Russia has been seen as evidence of the party’s alignment with Putin’s regime. “In this battle between Russia and the free world, today Georgia has a government that stands on the side of Russia,” MP Salome Samadashvili has said.  On Saturday, Mikhail Fishman, a prominent journalist at Russia’s independent TV Rain, which was taken off air by the Kremlin last week, was denied entry to Georgia even though his family and other Russians on his flight were reportedly allowed in.  Thursday’s announcement marks a volte-face, with Kobakhidze calling for EU bodies to review Georgia’s EU application “in an emergency manner and to make the decision to grant Georgia the status of an EU membership candidate”.  While the EU petition will appease some of the protesters, many observers are wary of interpreting the government’s U-turn as a sign of fully abandoning Russia and turning toward the west. Applying for EU membership is a lengthy process with no guarantee of success, and could fly under Putin’s radar while the Ukraine invasion continues, allowing Georgia in effect to hedge its bets.  “There was public pressure and petitions signed by thousands. They also knew Moldova would apply. The Georgian government saw this as a window of opportunity: if they missed it, the Georgian people wouldn’t tolerate it,” said Kornely Kakachia, head of the thinktank Georgian Institute of Politics.  “The Georgian government is playing realpolitik. They don’t know what the outcome of this war will be. And anyway, the Kremlin is busy now.”  Last week hundreds of Georgian volunteers were prevented from boarding a Ukrainian charter flight headed for Kyiv after the Georgian government blocked the plane from landing in Tbilisi. The plane was intended to deliver Georgian volunteers to Ukraine to join an international brigade fighting against Russian forces in the country.  Recent events have accelerated a growing divide between the Georgian government and its presidency under Salome Zourabichvili, who is publicly moving away from Russia. On Tuesday, after Georgian Dream said it would not expedite its EU application, Zourabichvili met in Brussels with the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, to call for the speedier reception of aspiring EU nations.  “You can try to frighten countries,” Zourabichvili said on CNN on Thursday. “But that doesn’t mean you change their orientation, that you change their determination to keep their independence.”

Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee and frequent commentator on Anglo-Irish relations, tweeted: “Instead of criticism of our Irish friends and neighbours, [the UK] could be much better replicating its response.”  He added that the UK “needs to move today from pettifogging process to active delivery”. “Don’t criticise Irish republic: replicate it. Remember how we responded to Ugandan Asian crisis? We can and must do this,” he said.  He was responding to claims that Ireland’s decision to lift all restrictions for refugees fleeing war would create a back door to the UK, leaving the country vulnerable to potential criminal elements.  The Irish government minister Roderic O’Gorman told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that giving shelter to refugees was “the right thing to do”, revealing that 2,200 Ukrainians had arrived in the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, compared with about 300 in the UK.  The country lifted its restrictions shortly after the invasion allowing Ukrainians to arrive without pre-vetting or visas.  Hoare was responding to a report in the Daily Telegraph that the common travel area meant Ukrainians who didn’t pass the British security checks could simply reach the UK by travelling to Northern Ireland and then getting a ferry to the UK.  Under the common travel area rules, British and Irish citizens can travel freely between the two countries without passport checks – although in practice they are required by most airlines.  A British government source alleged that this opened a back door to the UK. “Ireland has basically opened the door to everyone in Ukraine which creates a problem,” they told the Telegraph.  “We’ve seen this before with migrants from Albania that they have come through Dublin, into Belfast and across to the mainland to Liverpool. That’s created a drug cartel route.”  The briefing made headlines in Ireland, where government officials have set up a refugee assistance operation at Dublin airport offering Ukrainians social security numbers, medical cards, housing and other supports.  It has also opened a website where householders can register to take refugees in.  O’Gorman defended the open-door policy as “the right thing to do” and said the justice minister, Helen McEntee, was in regular contact with the UK home secretary, Priti Patel.  He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that Ireland’s “easy access” approach was part of a wider EU response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis.  “Everyone who looks at the pictures coming from Ukraine right now understands that we need an immediate and generous humanitarian response,” he added.  Ireland is to take 2% of all refugees flowing into the EU as part of a Brussels pact among member states.  The open border between Ireland and the UK on the island of Ireland has existed for decades. It became an issue during Brexit talks, with leave supporters advancing similar arguments over open routes to immigration and criminal gangs.  However, the Irish and British governments argued at the time that ongoing close cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda was the best way to crack down on drugs and criminality.

In a U-turn from last week, when it defended its decision to buy a cargo of Russian oil as necessary to keep energy flowing through Europe, the company said it would immediately stop buying Russian crude oil on the spot market and not renew term contracts. It will also change its crude oil supply chain to remove Russian supplies, but said this could take weeks to complete and would lead to reduced throughput at some of its refineries.  Shell currently gets about 8% of its crude oil from Russia, to be turned into diesel, petrol and other products at its refineries, the BBC reported.  The company will shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia, in a move that will affect 500 employees. That business is worth $400m. It will also start a phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas.  “This is a complex challenge,” it said on Tuesday. “Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer.”  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The company’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said: “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel – despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking – was not the right one and we are sorry.”  Shell bought the oil from the Swiss trader Trafigura at a discount of $28.50 a barrel. As the backlash over the purchase grew last weekend, Shell pledged to donate the profits from processing the oil to a dedicated fund. Van Beurden said the business would work with aid partners and humanitarian agencies to determine how best to use the fund to “alleviate the terrible consequences that this war is having on the people of Ukraine”.  A week ago, Shell said it would exit its joint ventures with the Russian state energy company Gazprom and said it would end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. It will exit its equity partnerships with Gazprom and related entities, including its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development in West Siberia and the Gydan energy venture.  Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Shell’s apology for buying Russian oil shows just how strong the winds of change are blowing through the corporate world.  “But unwinding Shell’s tentacles from the economy is set to be a complex affair and in making this announcement, Shell has also warned that exiting Russia’s energy sector will be hugely challenging. As worries about the squeeze in supply of oil continue, the elevated price of crude should keep Shell on the path of slicing big chunks off net debt and fund capital expenditure in new gas field expansion and into low-carbon alternatives like hydrogen.  “Whatever happens, Shell is still set to remain an oil and gas giant for decades, but by taking this stance and exiting the Russian markets with a continued focus on renewables, it should help reduce the risk of the company ending up in the ethical waste bin.”

The EPA is widely expected to confirm a proposed plan outlined last year that will extend the use of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and dinotefuran on US farmland for the next 15 years, even though the agency has noted “ecological risks of concern, particularly to pollinators and aquatic invertebrates”.  These four insecticides are all types of neonicotinoids, a class of chemicals that is widely used on crops to treat them for pests but has been found to cause devastation among non-target insects, such as bees. The chemicals assault receptors in an insect’s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death.  Neonicotinoids are used across 150m acres of American cropland, an area roughly the size of Texas, and have contributed to the land becoming 48 times more toxic than it was a quarter of a century ago. The chemicals are water soluble and quickly leach out of plants into soils and streams, causing such harmful impacts to wildlife that Canada has restricted their use while the EU has banned the outdoor deployment of clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam.  But while states such as Connecticut and New Jersey have enacted some curbs on neonicotinoids, the US federal government is set to bend to pressure from farming groups and pesticide makers to perpetuate their use nationally.  “We are already seeing crashes in insect numbers and we don’t have another 15 years to waste,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity.  “It’s frustrating to see the EPA go down this path. We really are at a crossroads – we can follow the science and the rest of the world or we can go out on our own and appease the chemical industry.”  An EPA spokeswoman said that review decisions for the neonicotinoids will be issued in “late 2022” and that mitigation rules for their use are being considered. “We understand the importance of pollinators for healthy ecosystems and a sustainable food supply,” she said, adding that the EPA “is working aggressively to protect pollinators, including bees”.  An outright ban, similar to the EU, appears unlikely for the US, however. “While the agency reviews the regulatory efforts of the EU, EPA also looks at regulation in countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and others that share our risk-based approach to regulation,” said the spokeswoman. “The differences in the details of our underlying laws can naturally lead to different regulatory conclusions.”  The use of neonicotinoids, hailed by industry as a key to bumper crop yields, has exploded since the 1990s. The chemicals are sprayed directly on to fruit and vegetables but are most commonly found embedded in the coating of corn and soybean seeds sold by companies such as Bayer and Syngenta to farmers.  Only a small fraction of the insecticide stays within the growing plant, however, instead seeping into pollen, water and soils where insects are exposed to it. Researchers have found that the cognitive functions of bees are scrambled by the chemicals, making them unable to find their way to their hives, while affected beetles stagger around as if drunk.  Neonicotinoids also harm birds, studies have shown, while their benefits are questionable, with crop yields in many cases not improved by the indiscriminate use of the chemicals.  “These insecticides are not helping the productivity of crops on fields – it seems an amazing effort to blanket all these acres with something that doesn’t have a return on investment,” said John Tooker, an entomologist at Penn State University.  “These seeds are marketed so well to farmers that they become scared they will have a catastrophic outbreak of pests if they don’t use them, even though this is unlikely. It has contributed to this toxic landscape across the country.”  The application of pesticides, along with habitat loss and climate change, has been cited as the main causes of spectacular insect declines recorded in the US as well as several European countries. Worldwide, it is estimated that insect populations are dropping by as much as 2% a year, with the United Nations warning that half a million species could be wiped out this century.  Tooker said that neonicotinoids, if used judiciously, can be useful but that their ubiquity has contributed to insects’ woes. “It’s difficult to dismiss the increasing toxicity in the landscape and think it’s doing nothing to insect populations,” he said. “These are the most powerful insecticides ever produced. We are just making insects’ lives harder in every possible way.”  Environmental groups, meanwhile, have launched a legal effort to force the EPA to regulate neonicotinoid-coated seeds and have urged the agency to reduce the number of “emergency” permits issued to states that request the spraying of the chemicals beyond what is normally allowed without a full review process.  The EPA is considering allowing farmers in Florida to spray clothianidin on 125,000 acres of citrus crops, including oranges, grapefruits and lemon, which would be the ninth consecutive year such an emergency request has been granted.  “It defies all logic to say an emergency has been going on for nine years, the process has been clearly abused,” Donley said. “The science is so conclusive that these chemicals are harmful to the environment that this emergency exemption process is being used as a backdoor approval that goes on forever.  “We need an administration that is willing to think about reform and challenge the status quo and we haven’t seen that with the Biden administration. It is certainly better than Trump but there is a lot of disappointment at the lost opportunity for change.”

The allegation, which the MP said would usually be a resigning matter, was made as Tory colleagues queued up in parliament to condemn the Home Office for “dragging its feet” over visa applications for those escaping the Russian armed forces.  The backlash from MPs, after it was revealed that the UK has so far issued 500 visas to Ukrainian nationals seeking sanctuary, came as Boris Johnson insisted the UK would be as generous as possible to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion.  At a Commons session that Patel did not attend, Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, said the home secretary had told MPs on Monday that a visa application centre had been set up for Ukrainians in Calais – where several hundred Ukrainians had gathered.  He said: “In response to my question yesterday, the home secretary said: ‘I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais that we have staff in Calais.’  “That was untrue and under any normal administration that in itself would be a resignation [matter].”  On Monday afternoon, there were still signs in Calais telling refugees to go to centres in Paris or Brussels.  The Home Office minister Kevin Foster replied indicating that Patel had on Monday also said that a new processing centre for visas would soon be set up.  “I understand the home secretary clarified her remarks yesterday. There is a reason why we believe it is right that key security checks are done before people arrive here in the UK,” he said.  Foster said a new processing centre at Lille was expected to be set up within the next 24 hours, and the Home Office is hoping to set up transport for the 75-mile journey from Calais.  A succession of Tory MPs criticised the Home Office’s response to the war. Alec Shelbrooke, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell, demanded the Home Office “get a grip” on processing visa applications for Ukrainian refugees.  “Does the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that has not been seen for 80 years in Europe? We don’t want to stand in this house and listen to plans and processes, we want dates, we want action… This is a disgrace,” he said.  The Conservative MP Julian Sturdy said his York Outer constituents were ready and willing to offer help, adding: “The only barrier to their support seems to be Home Office bureaucracy.  “Now is not the time for box ticking and red tape.”  The former minister Steve Brine, the MP for Winchester, said his constituents believed the government’s response was “far too robotic”.  Labour’s Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that while other countries were supporting hundreds of thousands of people, 600 people seeking to reach the UK had been turned back at Calais.  “Most want to stay close to home but some want to come here to join family or friends, and we should be helping them; instead most people are still being held up by our Home Office bureaucracy or being turned away,” she said.  Johnson told the cabinet on Tuesday the UK would be “as generous as we could” in its support for Ukrainian refugees, a No 10 spokesperson said.  The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier admitted the process for bringing Ukrainian refugees to the UK had “not been quick enough” and that it had been made more difficult by sending refugees to Paris from Calais.  Wallace expressed frustration when asked about the issues with visas, and said he was “not the home secretary” but that he had been assured that changes would be made.  Wallace said that the MoD would give operation support to processing visas but acknowledged the process had been flawed.  “It’s difficult for those people – why wouldn’t it be? – to go all the way back to Paris,” Wallace told BBC Breakfast. “We need to upscale it, I know that the home secretary has already doubled, or trebled in some cases, more people in different processing centres. We can do more, we will do more.”

Sadly, I had to decline. I had all these dates booked I couldn’t cancel. Then he took this silver foil out of his pocket, took a whiff and offered it to me. I refused, saying, ‘I don’t do any of that stuff.’ Jimi replied, ‘Brian, I should have more people like you around me.’”  Never a truer word spoken: at 82, Brian Auger is a picture of good health, fine humour and energetic creativity. Auger is a London Zelig of sorts – a musician whose connections and creativity saw him serve as a pivotal figure in the centre of what are now fondly considered the Swinging 60s’ jazz, blues and rock scenes – yet he’s best remembered, if at all, for This Wheel’s on Fire, the 1968 Top 5 hit that he and Julie Driscoll scored with a then-unreleased Bob Dylan song. Said tune ended up providing the theme music for Absolutely Fabulous, ensuring Auger’s enduring status as an answer in pub quizzes – while reinforcing the sense that he was a one-hit wonder.  “They didn’t even use the original version,” Auger says of the series producers, with evident distaste. “Instead, they were so cheap they paid Julie [now Tippetts] a minuscule fee to re-record the vocal with session musicians. They spunked a fortune on that series so it’s bloody insulting.”  Dynamic … Auger on stage in Dusseldorf in 1973. Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy  While aggrieved at this slight, Auger is evidently a happy man. Considering that he is the missing link of sorts from an era where many of his contemporaries earned vast fortunes, I expected him to trot out the “I’ve been ripped off” grievances many veteran rockers trade in. Not at all, but having been a professional musician since the mid-1950s, Auger has experienced every high and low possible, none of it appearing to dampen his love for making music.  I declined Hendrix as I was happy with Julie as vocalist and Vic Briggs on guitar  A new archival series, Auger Incorporated, aims to document his entire career. Unreleased live and studio sessions with the likes of Sonny Boy Williamson, Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, Billy Cobham and others will appear alongside his classic recordings with Julie Driscoll and the Trinity and Oblivion Express.  It’s a career with roots in Auger’s earliest childhood, he explains. He grew up in Shepherd’s Bush, west London. “My family had a pianola and this fascinated me from infancy,” he recalls. When their house was bombed during the second world war, he was evacuated to Yorkshire. “The family who hosted us happened to have a piano – such luck! I began teaching myself to play by ear.” His grammar school offered a grand piano, so he decided to have a go after class. “One day the headmaster caught me and I thought I was done for because I was playing Winifred Atwell tunes, not classical. Instead, he announced that I would play in front of the Friday morning assembly. Normally, this involved some poor sod sawing away on his violin but, come Friday, the headmaster announced” – Auger puts on a posh voice – “‘Auger is going to play boo-gie woo-gie’ – honestly, it could have been a Monty Python sketch! I played Atwell’s Cross Hands Boogie and, when I finished, the pupils erupted like at a football match. I knew then that music was what I wanted to do with my life.”  Jazz caught the teenager’s ear and he soon found himself playing with other talented youths – Tubby Hayes, John McLaughlin, Joe Harriott, Alan Skidmore and Rick Laird among them – on London’s dynamic modern jazz scene. Hungry for work and experience, Auger would play a jazz set at Ronnie Scott’s then rush over to Wardour Street to play R&B at the Flamingo. “This caused some tension as many jazz musicians looked down on me for playing R&B,” he says. Depping for an ill Georgie Fame at the Flamingo, Auger found himself forced to learn how to play Fame’s Hammond organ on stage. This changed everything.  “I’d first heard Jimmy Smith play Hammond and loved his sound but I’d always considered myself a jazz pianist,” says Auger. “Then I got Georgie’s gig and …” He laughs, still surprised how his instant mastery of the Hammond made him a mod icon.  ‘Rod was always obnoxious’ … Rod Stewart, Long John Baldry, Driscoll and Auger as the Steampacket in the mid-60s  Giorgio Gomelsky, a Swiss national who had briefly managed the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds (that’s Auger’s harpsichord on For Your Love), saw star quality in Auger and became his manager. In 1965, Gomelsky paired him with Long John Baldry (“the best blues singer in the UK”) and Baldry’s modish protege Rod Stewart (“Rod was always obnoxious – even way back then”). Auger insisted that Julie Driscoll, a young singer he had started working with, join the fledgling supergroup and Steampacket quickly became one of the UK’s foremost live outfits. They never released anything during their brief existence – Baldry and Stewart left in 1966 to pursue solo careers – leaving Driscoll and Auger as co-leaders of the Trinity.  Signed to Gomelsky’s own label, Marmalade Records, the Trinity’s revolutionary blend of jazz and R&B, rock and folk created a protean psych-flavoured fusion that won great kudos. In September 1966 a manager named Chas Chandler (once bassist in the Animals), rang Auger, suggesting that a young American guitarist he had just flown over from New York join the Trinity as vocalist and guitarist.  “I declined as I was happy with Julie as vocalist and Vic Briggs on guitar,” says Auger. “So Chas asked if his guy could sit in with the band – we were playing the Cromwellian, a very chic, late-night club – and I said I’d make a decision once I met him. Well, he seemed a nice guy, quite shy, so he joined us for our second set and, as the Cromwellian was one of the few places where you could legally drink after hours, it was filled with musicians. When Jimi began to play, boy, he just about set fire to the club and Eric Clapton turned incredibly pale!”  Auger says he has no regrets in not recruiting Hendrix. Understandably so: the Trinity recorded four remarkable albums between 1967 and 69. They were huge in France and very popular across the continent – 1969’s Streetnoise album features Czechoslovakia, a moving meditation on the Soviet crushing of the Prague Spring written after the Trinity played there in 1968 – although Auger and Driscoll’s eclecticism likely hindered their music reaching a mass audience.  This combined with being on a record label run by their spendthrift manager. “In 1969 we returned from a US tour to find we had no money at all,” says Auger. “Giorgio had a staff of 24 yet we were his only successful band. All our earnings went into sustaining his lifestyle. He then went bankrupt and we were left bereft. Julie was so upset she left the music industry – at least for a while.”  Still making music … Auger. Photograph: Peter Heck  Auger started the 1970s afresh fronting the Oblivion Express, a jazz-rock ensemble who quickly won a large US following. “One of our American promoters said to me, ‘Your band is the only one that attracts a mixed Black and white audience – why’s that?’ I replied: ‘Look at the band – it’s Black and white musicians.’ We played with everyone – Kiss, War, Led Zeppelin; Maurice White invited Oblivion Express to support Earth, Wind and Fire, said he loved our music. Tony Williams and Herbie Hancock championed us. Things were wide open then, no compromises were necessary.”  Auger moved to Los Angeles in 1975, dividing his time since between the US and the continent. “My wife’s Italian so we wanted the children to be bilingual.” And handily, he says, “in Italy, Germany and France the interest’s always been strong”.  Auger’s long absence from the UK meant his legacy was neglected – at least until Eddie Piller of Acid Jazz Records took to hailing him as “the godfather of acid jazz” at the start of the 1990s and he started attracting youthful audiences dressed akin to those he played for in the early 60s. “The 80s were a tough decade for a Hammond player as everyone wanted synthesisers,” he says, “so I’d stripped things back to a small combo. Finding this young, sharply dressed audience – a nice surprise.”  Having sued Gromelsky and won ownership of his Marmalade masters, Auger has since ensured he retains ownership of his music – a move that proved lucrative when everyone from All Saints to Common started sampling his catalogue in the 90s. Dissatisfied with a disintegrating industry, Auger had chosen not to license his recordings in recent years until he was approached by Germany’s !K7 music conglomerate for this epic reissue programme on Soul Bank Music. Considering the jazz ferments currently lighting up contemporary British music, its perfect timing for Auger’s legacy to be reconsidered.  “Nowadays my son’s my drummer and my daughter’s my vocalist,” says Auger with a broad smile. “It’s a family affair and we love to go out there and keep the music alive.”

These novels are up against Booker shortlisted Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead and The Exhibitionist by Charlotte Mendelson, who was shortlisted for the 2008 prize.  Mendelson is joined on the longlist by four more authors who have been previously nominated: Elif Shafak, Leone Ross, Catherine Chidgey and Rachel Elliott. Yet the popular authors Sally Rooney and Hanya Yanagihara, who have both been selected in previous years, didn’t make the cut this year.  Chair of judges Mary Ann Sieghart attributed the fact that “a lot of very well-known authors didn’t make it to the longlist and five debut novelists did” to the debuts simply being “brilliant books”.  “Why people are starting to write brilliant books, and managing to do so with their first novel, I can’t really answer … but is it possible that perhaps during the first lockdown people thought, you know what, I’ve always wanted to write a novel, maybe I’ll give it a go?”  Many of the novels that were eligible for this year’s prize were written during the coronavirus pandemic, a reason why, Sieghart thinks, quite a few of the submissions were dystopian novels. Other common themes among the novels the judges considered were lesbian relationships and female friendship, but what struck Sieghart about the books “was a diversity rather than the homogeneity of them”.  Any woman writing in English is eligible for the award, and this year the longlist of 16 is made up of five British authors, six Americans, two New Zealanders, one Turkish-British, one American-Canadian, and one Trinidadian writer.  Sieghart said that after a “harmonious” judging session, she and her fellow judges, Lorraine Candy, Dorothy Koomson, Anita Sethi and Pandora Sykes “discovered we’d picked a fantastically diverse list”.  She added: “We didn’t have to make any sort of corrections to try to get a good variety of subject matter or nationality of author or ethnicity of author or genre, it was just all there. So that was rather wonderful.”  A quarter of the books on the list are published by independent presses, with three publishing houses, Unbound, Myriad Editions and Europa Editions, having a book on the longlist for the first time.  The shortlist will be revealed on 27 April and the winner on 15 June.  Established in 1996, after the Booker prize failed to shortlist any women five years earlier, the Women’s prize is intended “to celebrate and promote fiction by women to the widest range of readers possible”. Former winners include Piranesi by Susanna Clarke and Zadie Smith’s On Beauty.

Sign up for Pushing Buttons, our weekly guide to what’s going on in video games.  Like a lot of people interested in video games, I have spent most of the past week rampaging across the Lands Between on a phantom horse, slaying trolls, exploring castles and being repeatedly stamped on by giant boss monsters. The critical consensus is that Elden Ring, a new open-world fantasy adventure from the makers of the Dark Souls series, might just be one of the greatest games ever made. It is extraordinarily beautiful to look at, it’s incredibly challenging and it encourages players to discover its secrets however they see fit. It is also horrible to interact with. Sometimes really horrible.  I’m not talking about the combat or the movement mechanics – that’s all fine. It’s tough but it’s fine. I’m talking about the interface: the menu systems, the button-mapping, the on-screen information display (or HUD), which all give players access to different facets of the game. They’re horribly designed. You need two different buttons to open and close the map. There are two different inventories – the main equipment inventory and a pouch – and they’re on different screens. Sometimes you pick up an object and it just disappears into your inventory, which works exactly like that drawer in the kitchen where you keep all the useful stuff you can never find again.  This isn’t how games are supposed to work. User interface design is a science that’s taken very seriously in the industry. At the Yorkshire Games festival last month, the user experience designer David Sheppard, once at Jaguar Land Rover but now at Ubisoft, gave a really interesting talk on how much thought goes into creating games that are seamlessly useful and understandable to the player. He talked about gestalt principles, semiotics, heuristic design – all the theories making games comprehensible and pleasurable to use that have guided design since the 1980s. Even if a game is meant to be hard, it shouldn’t be the menus and button layout that challenge the player – it should be what happens in the game world.  So how does Elden Ring get away with it? Certainly industry insiders are baffled. One forlorn user experience designer argued on Twitter that the almost perfect scores for the game made a mockery of his entire career. But the thing with Elden Ring, as with all the Souls titles before it, is that the metagame – the stuff that goes on around the actual on-screen action – is as important as the game itself. This is an arcane, esoteric universe where players must work together on discord channels and message boards to figure out the best courses of action. Just as scientists had to decode the Rosetta Stone to read hieroglyphic script, just as the Bletchley Park boffins had to crack the enigma code to interpret Nazi communications, players see mastering the very interface and controls of this game as part of the challenge.  FromSoftware, the maker of Elden Ring, has managed to build into its audience an almost masochistic mindset, and it has done this through the arcane play spaces it designs on screen. It has taught players that they will usually lose and that everything will be hard, and in this way, simply being able to navigate the menus becomes a badge of honour. In a world where big games seem obsessed with over-explaining every facet of the lore, experience and through line of each game, where players are endlessly spoon-fed by quest logs and helpful quest-givers, it is almost refreshing to be treated badly. Of course, it only works if the game in question is an idiosyncratic masterpiece. And in many, many ways it’s a beautiful thing that game developers now take intuitiveness and accessibility so seriously.  There is a tinge of cruelty in Elden Ring that is kind of avant-garde. Like the music of Laurie Anderson or Frank Zappa, or the art of Man Ray or Carl Andre, you have to fight just to understand what’s going on. I’ve put 100 hours into Elden Ring and I still get mad that you need a different button to close the map than you need to open it – it’s just so bad. The thing is, I’ll be moaning about it after 500 hours and 1,000 hours, but I’ll still be playing. Because it is wonderful. What does that tell us about art and rules? Nothing easy, that’s for sure.  What to play  If you want to experience a hard game with a really good user interface, I’m going to recommend Dead Space, the sci-fi horror spectacular from Electronic Arts. Set aboard an interplanetary mining ship that’s been invaded by killer aliens, it’s a tense and often terrifying action adventure that makes innovative use of a “diegetic” interface. In other words, all the health and ammo info, as well as other options, are displayed within the game itself, so they appear part of the world rather than abstract menus. It’s an incredibly immersive system that inspired a lot of other developers, especially in the VR space. You can either play the original 2008 game on Steam or hold off for the remake, which is set to arrive later this year.  What to read    The video-game industry is continuing to react to the war in Ukraine with its own sanctions against Russia. Electronic Arts is ceasing game sales and virtual currency bundles in Russia and Belarus, while Nintendo has put its eShop into maintenance mode in the territories. Epic Games is keeping Fortnite running in Russia but has ceased all e-commerce transactions around the game. It’s a swift set of measures from an industry that has often shied away from politics.  For something completely different, Christian Donlan at Eurogamer has written a fascinating piece on locks and lock-picking, common elements of action adventures. But how do all those safe-breaking mini-games compare to the real thing?  This week in the metaverse: Fortnite creator Epic Games has bought music-sharing site Bandcamp. But why? Here’s a clear-sighted piece of analysis from Brendan Sinclair at Gamesindustry.biz about the deal and what it means.  What to click    ‘I just wanted to play Duck Hunt with my kids’: the man on a mission to bring back the light gun  Gran Turismo 7 review – the ultimate racing game is fresh and comfortingly familiar  Can a video game be as good for my marriage as family therapy? Not this one  Question block  I tweeted out for questions in the hour before the newsletter was due to be filed (sorry Keza, you knew what to expect when you handed this to me) and thankfully got some really interesting responses. I’m going to answer this one from Guy Bailey: “Does it matter if you never complete your favourite video game? #Fallout4 in my case.”  A resounding no from me! Video games should never become a chore. They are not something you have to finish in order to get everything you need from them. With an open-world game such as Fallout 4, the experience is more akin to highly applied tourism – you are visiting a landscape, enjoying sights, sounds and experiences that draw you in. If all you want to do is play with systems, if you want to bicycle the whole of Los Santos in GTA V or become a blacksmith in the Elder Scrolls, that’s just as valid as completing the main quests. Game-designer Sid Meier once famously defined a game as a series of interesting decisions – if this is the case, how you make those decisions is up to you. There is enough in our lives that demands completion – video games can ask for it, but you can refuse and simply make the decisions you’re interested in. Your time is precious – game-designers are happy for any of it that you share with them.

The pioneering photographer quietly documented much of the 20th century – slums, celebrities, war zones, world leaders, everything. But she has never been celebrated like she is today. After the exhibitions dedicated to her fashion and street photography, reportage and portraiture, Brighton Museum is paying tribute to her with a full retrospective. The 96-year-old tells me she can’t believe what has happened – not least because she stored her photographs in shoe boxes under her bed for decades and pretty much forgot about them.  Stafford is on the short side (5ft 1in at her peak), glamorous, serious-minded – and a huge amount of fun. And boy does she have stories. Even her stories have stories. So we start in the Great Depression, when she was a little girl walking to the big department store downtown in Cleveland, Ohio, with her mother. She noticed that a girl ahead of her was not wearing shoes, and asked why. “My mother said: ‘Probably because the family can’t afford them.’ And I think that was one of my early eye-openers on reality.”  Marilyn Stafford in Lebanon, 1960.  By the way, she says, her mother lived to 103, at which point she died of vanity. “She would have gone on more, but she was afraid to have her cataracts done and was going deaf. My mother was so vain that she wouldn’t wear a hearing aid, and she said: ‘When I can’t see and can’t hear any more I will kill myself.’ When she couldn’t see and couldn’t hear, she just stopped eating.” Stafford has a habit of telling macabre stories with relish. She is Zooming from her home in West Sussex. Her red lipstick is perfectly coordinated with her red glasses, her hair a magnificent white bob and she looks gorgeous. These days she is partially sighted, so her daughter, Lina Clarke, is here to help with the technology. I ask Stafford if she lives alone. She sounds horrified. “No! I have a cat called Minouche. But I call her Minou for short.”  Stafford grew up in a middle-class family – her father a pharmacist who had emigrated from the Baltics as a young boy, her mother a great beauty who dreamed of being a “lady”. When she was young, her parents hoped she would be the next Shirley Temple and sent her to bed with curling wrappers in her hair. Did she want to be the next Shirley Temple? “Not me! I hated it. It was so painful to sleep on those things.” But she did like acting, and between the ages of 10 to 18 trained at the Cleveland Play House, alongside Paul Newman and Joel Grey. “I learned the Stanislavski method. I think I’m probably the only Stanislavski photographer around.” She giggles. “Or was!”  She studied drama at university – paying her way by working at a local defence plant. Stafford was so convincing in one role, playing a nasty girl in a Lillian Hellman play, that her boyfriend said she must be innately obnoxious and dumped her. “Maybe he was just making an excuse,” she says.  In New York, she played a few cameos in off-Broadway productions but struggled as an actor. Then serendipity took a hand. In 1948, two friends were making a documentary about Albert Einstein at his home in Princeton, New Jersey. They invited Stafford to go along with them and asked if she would take his photo. She had used her parents’ Box Brownie, but nothing more. “That’s when I was given my first 35mm camera. I was just thinking: ‘Oh my God, they’ve given me a camera I’ve never used before!’ I was terrified. Terrified. I go numb at moments like that. All I was aware of was that I had to focus and click the shutter.”  One of Stafford’s pictures of Albert Einstein, 1948.  Her photos of the great physicist are wonderful – he’s smiling, crumpled, inquisitive and human. In one photo he looks as if he is listening intently. “Yes, he had asked how many feet per second go through the camera and the director explained to him. He was very serious about it, and he said: ‘Ah yes, now I understand, thank you very much.’” What’s behind the lovely smile in the other picture? “I’d like to think he was smiling at me!” Stafford says.  At 23, she set off for Europe on the back of another strange story. “My friend found out her husband was having an affair. He told her to go home to her mother while he sorted himself out. She said: ‘No way! I’m going to take a trip to Paris and I’m taking Marilyn with me and you’re going to pay for it’ – which he did.”  In Paris, she got a job singing as part of the ensemble at the prestigious dinner club Chez Carrère (apparently the only club the newly married Princess Elizabeth was allowed to visit). She must have had a huge confidence to be taking photos of Einstein one minute, singing in a top club the next? “I don’t know if it’s confidence. It’s what’s called in Yiddish chutzpah. You just do it.”  Street sleepers, Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, circa 1950.  At the club she befriended the singer Eddie Constantine, who was dating Edith Piaf. Stafford found herself part of Piaf’s extended entourage, regularly invited to her home for breakfast along with Constantine and the many waifs, strays and celebs who shared her home. Charles Aznavour occupied an attic room, while the wife and children of Piaf’s former lover Marcel Cerdan (a boxing world champion, who had been killed in an air crash) also lived there. There is a fabulous photograph of Piaf in the book that accompanies the exhibition – dressed in white and laughing, the opposite of how you’d expect to see her. “That’s why I like the photograph,” Stafford says. “Because she’s laughing, and she did laugh.”  During the day, she would take the bus from the Left Bank to the end of the line where she photographed people in the slums of Boulogne-Billancourt. Some pictures are heartbreaking (a homeless woman asleep in a child’s buggy), others joyous (cheeky kids revelling in the camera’s attention). These photos tell stories in a single frame. Meanwhile, her fashion photography is stylish and funny. Because she was technically inept, she avoided studios and took her models on to the streets. In one picture, a beautiful model stands outside the Louvre in a long white coat, brolly in one hand, high heels in the other, and feet splayed – think Marilyn Monroe meets Charlie Chaplin.  Fashion photography from 1960 (top) and circa 1950.  In Paris, she befriended the photographers and Magnum co-founders Robert Capa, David “Chim” Seymour and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Capa asked her why men always cried rather than nibbled on her shoulder. “To this very day the same thing happens. Lots of men cry on my shoulder.” Would she have liked Capa to nibble on her shoulder? “I must say Capa was very attractive and I would have dearly loved to have more than a friendship with him, but he was older than me and I think he wanted more sophisticated women than me.”  Instead, Capa encouraged her to take photographs and suggested she become Seymour’s assistant. “I don’t like carrying heavy things and I was a coward, terrified to go into a war zone, so I turned down that generous offer.” That’s lucky, I say. “Yes. Both Chim and Capa got killed.”  She adored Cartier-Bresson. I ask what she learned from him. “I think I learned quietness – not to be obvious as a photographer. He would shoot without you knowing. I remember sitting at a cafe with him and he had a camera in his lap and he saw a photograph he wanted so he lifted the camera up, not to his face, just off his lap and took a photograph.” Did she use that technique? “No. I was not as clever as him. I just put the camera up and took pictures.”  The activist Francesca Serio, who sued the mafia.  Stafford is being unduly modest. She had a wonderful eye. In 1956, she married a foreign correspondent and moved around the world with his job. In Italy, she took a memorable photograph of Francesca Serio, a labourer and activist who became the first person to sue the Sicilian mafia, after they killed her son. Serio has an astonishing presence – in one photo her face shines beatifically out of the blackest background; in another her gaze is harsh, and a single accusatory finger is raised.  When Stafford was six months pregnant with Lina, she travelled to Tunisia to document people in refugee camps who had fled France’s “scorched-earth” policy in Algeria. Now, she says, she looks at these photographs of refugees and thinks of Ukraine. “I just feel sick and sad all the time. It breaks my heart.” One portrait of a mother and child bears a striking resemblance to Dorothea Lange’s Dust Bowl images. She holds her baby tenderly but her eyes are a thousand miles away. Cartier-Bresson sent this set of photos to the Observer and two were published on the front page. It resulted in the Observer sending a reporter to cover the story of the refugees. Stafford began to feel that her photos could serve a purpose.  Twiggy (left) and Lee Marvin.  She has always had a gift of taking photographs of people, particularly women, that pose questions. Her subjects often seem far away, in reverie or despair – whether it’s the woman with the baby in Tunisia or Joanna Lumley, Sharon Tate and Twiggy back in swinging 60s London.  Throughout 1960, she photographed everyday life in Lebanon. The pictures were intended for a book, but the publisher thought there was too much grit and not enough glamour. It took 30 years to get the pictures published. “You don’t earn a living that way, do you?”  A market in Tripoli, Lebanon, 1960.  Baalbeck village, Lebanon, 1960.  Stafford and her husband separated when Lina was young. He went to work in Moscow, she came to London. As a female photographer, she had always been in a tiny minority. Now as a single mother, balancing work with bringing up Lina was even tougher. Five years ago, she established the annual Marilyn Stafford FotoReportage award for female photographers. “It was with the aim of letting women have a little extra money that would help them in the event that they had to care for children and pay for that care or any number of reasons they might have.”  Her commercial work (she ran a fashion agency with the French photographer Michel Arnaud) subsidised more personal foreign trips to India, where she spent a month following the prime minister, Indira Gandhi. In 1972, she travelled to the new country of Bangladesh with the intention of taking portraits of some of the estimated more than 200,000 Bengali women and girls raped by Pakistani soldiers in the liberation war. Stafford returned home defeated.  Indira Gandhi speaking at a rally in Kashmir, 1972.  The Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand comforts a victim of the Bangladesh liberation war, 1972.  “The eyes of the people I met had a look of such terror in them. Everybody. And I wanted so much to get the feeling and I never did. I photographed an awful lot of faces and eyes, but I just wasn’t able to capture it.” She had photographed people fleeing war in Algeria, but this was different. “Bangladesh was the first time I had seen the ravages of war first-hand and it marked me terribly because I was a real innocent. It’s one thing to read about war and see somebody else’s photographs, but to actually be there and see it … And I didn’t even go through the war – I just saw the after-effects.”  Did it change her as a photographer? “It did in a way, because when I returned I was offered a full-time job on a fashion publication and I turned it down. I didn’t want to spend my life taking fashion photographs when there was much more going on in the world.”  Stafford retired in her mid-50s. In her 70s, she married a Portuguese man who loved to tango and shared her values (he had been an active antifascist under the Salazar dictatorship). They moved to Sussex, where she organised poetry trails and got involved in a literary festival. Although he died a few years ago, she has kept herself busy, sorting out the shoeboxes under her bed and getting her archive in order.  Marilyn Stafford: ‘It was a marvellous, delightful way to earn a living.’ Photograph: Nina Emett/FotoDocument  She has done this with the support of the documentary photographer Nina Emett, who has co-curated the exhibition with Lina and edited the accompanying book. Again serendipity had a part to play. Stafford sought out Emett after seeing a photographic project curated by her on the streets of Brighton, and Emett fell in love with Stafford’s photography. “Nina has organised a group of people in Brighton called the Marilyn Stafford Working Group, whose aim is to promote my photography! It’s unbelievable.” She really does find it hard to believe that anybody could dedicate themselves to championing her work.  Now that her photography is displayed in galleries and museums, does she regard it as art? She hoots at the idea. “No! I was a working photographer. It was a marvellous, delightful way to earn a living,” she says. “I was just lucky.”  The Marilyn Stafford FotoReportage award of £2,000 is for female documentary photographers whose work focuses on solutions to important social and environmental issues. The 2022 award launches on 8 March in celebration of International Women’s Day. The exhibition Marilyn Stafford: A Life in Photography is at Brighton Museum & Art Gallery until 8 May. The book of the same title is published by Bluecoat Press.

In true showbiz style, Paris fashion week ended with one of its greatest hits. A Chanel show in homage to the iconic tweed suit was a surefire crowd pleaser. Clutching the squares of pink tweed sent out as invitations, guests sat on tweed-upholstered seats to view a pageant of tweed dresses, coats and suits. If it was possible to sing along with a catwalk show, the audience would have known all the words.  The designer Virginie Viard said she had been thinking about Coco Chanel who, on walks in the Scottish countryside, would gather ferns, flowers and heathers to use as the blueprint for her next collection’s colour palette. This season, Coco came with a generous side order of Kristen Stewart as Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larran’s recent film Spencer. The bright tweeds on the runway, worn with short skirts and baubled with gilt buttons, recalled the opening scene in which Stewart, whose on-screen wardrobe was made by Chanel, runs across a muddy English field in a tartan tweed blazer and gobstopper pearl earrings.  Some of the looks from the Chanel show in Paris. Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock  When Karl Lagerfeld was at the helm, every Chanel show was a 15-minute fashion funfair ride – guests were immersed in a spaceship launchpad one season, a Parisian bistro the next.  Since taking over in 2019, Viard’s shows have been subtle and restrained in comparison. Her designs have proved a hit with consumers, with a bullish average price increase of 71% in three years on handbags reflecting a confident mood at Chanel. This lighthearted show – with jokey touches such as chain-strapped mini hip flasks, and double-C logo wellies and galoshes – saw Viard edge closer to Lagerfeld-era showmanship.  The war in Ukraine has continued to redraw alliances within the fashion industry as it emerged that a Russian designer had been dropped from the Paris fashion week schedule, while the high street retailer Uniqlo announced its intention to keep all 50 stores in Russia open.  Valentin Yudashkin’s digital show was removed from the official Paris fashion week programme after the designer refused to break his silence over the war. In 2008, Yudashkin, who came to prominence in the 1980s dressing Raisa Gorbachev, designed new uniforms for the Russian army, although Ralph Toledano, the president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode said that this was not a decisive factor in the decision.  “We have nothing against the Russian people, but we will not support or accept to have in our calendar those who support his [Putin’s] position,” Toledano told Women’s Wear Daily, describing Yudashkin as “an affiliate of the regime”.  Against an exodus of fashion brands from Russia, Uniqlo bucked the trend by announcing its intention to keep trading in the country. Tadashi Yanai, the CEO of Japan’s Fast Retailing, the parent company to Uniqlo, said: “Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do.” Yanai said that he was opposed to the war, but that business decisions should not be politically motivated. The decision runs counter to a wave of fashion businesses, including Fast Retailing’s Spanish-based competitor Inditex, who have exited Russia in recent days.

He tried several times but the line was engaged.  “I don’t know why the embassy didn’t tell us the war was going to break out when other countries advised their citizens to leave days before,” he said. Yang – not his real name - then followed his university’s emergency protocols and took refuge in a bomb shelter. Days later an escape route began to circulate among his friends. He decided to follow the instruction and flee on his own.  Almost two weeks before Russia acted – described by the Chinese media as “special military operations” – countries including the UK and Canada advised their nationals to leave Ukraine. But in the case of China, which had nearly 6,000 nationals in the country, it was not until the day after the war broke out that the embassy advised its citizens to leave.  “By the time they knew [the war was to break out], it was already too late to evacuate,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China programme at the Stimson Center in Washington. Until the war broke out, many high-profile Chinese pundits and news outlets had insisted western prediction of an invasion was “fake news”.  Smashed windows after shelling by the Russian army in Kyiv. Photograph: Ukrinform/Rex/Shutterstock  China said on Monday most of its nationals had left Ukraine. At the annual press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing on the same day, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, told millions of its citizens abroad that the country “is always at your back” in answering a question from the Xinhua news agency. The answer was later widely publicised across Chinese media.  However, while state media praised the diplomatic mission for its work, its response since the war has also drawn much criticism from some Ukraine-based Chinese students, who spent days trapped in bomb shelters in a war-stricken foreign country. They say the embassy’s slow advice and confusing messaging – including advising them to display a Chinese flag on their vehicles, then a day later telling them “not to display identifying symbols” – contrasted with the image of order and control Beijing had been trying to project over the years.  “For a long time, Chinese state agencies as well as state-sponsored media have adopted an opportunistic approach to use every event as an opportunity to advance propaganda goals,” said Ling Li, an expert in Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna.  “This is exactly what happened when the embassy rescinded its previous advice after realising how negatively an expressive pro-Russia position is viewed by the Ukrainians and the international community, which was apparently not considered at all when it hastily issued its first advice.”  On Tuesday, a staffer at the embassy told the Guardian to find other means to contact the embassy for a response to this article, as his line was for Ukraine-based Chinese nationals only. But asked which department could respond to media inquiries, he said the embassy did not have such a department.  The embassy said last week it began to evacuate the first batch of Chinese nationals in the late evening of 28 February. And in an interview with the Beijing-based Global Times on the same day, an official explained the logistical challenge in withdrawing citizens while the war was raging.  A fraught and lonely escape  A pedestrian crosses the street in front of Chinese embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP  Last Tuesday, an anxious Chinese student in Kyiv posted on social media a recording of her desperate call to an embassy staffer, in which she was told to remain sheltered in place or board a train to Lviv by herself. She was trolled by unsympathetic nationalists online before deleting the post.  Yang’s escape was not smooth, either. At 7am on 1 March, he followed the escape route and ventured out to a Kyiv train station. “The station was clogged with people desperately trying to leave,” he said. “Luckily, I finally got on to a train. On the platform, men saw off their children and wives. It was a scene I had only seen in films. I’ll never forget it.”  He said he then spent 10 hours standing in a packed train compartment. En route, he realised he had escaped Kyiv in such a rush that he had left his two beloved cellos behind. For the past five years, the instruments had been with him touring around China and Ukraine. His computer was in the bomb shelter, too. He carried only a bag with his passport, a few clothes and bank cards. His destination: Lviv in western Ukraine, then Poland.  Yang was lucky. On 1 March, a Chinese national was shot and injured while attempting to flee eastern Ukraine, according to state media. A day earlier, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing was “making all feasible plans to help Chinese citizens in Ukraine leave the country”.  On its official website and social media account, the embassy began to issue multiple evacuation instructions and open letters, including one that clarified the ambassador was still in Kyiv to help on the evening of 26 February – after the war broke out.  To Luo Changshi*, 23, another Chinese student who wishes to remain anonymous, the official plan came too late. Having not heard from his embassy for days, Luo jumped on a motorcycle to leave Kyiv with his classmate as soon as the war broke out on 24 February.  They first stopped at a mutual friend’s house in a small village to recharge and figure out a detailed plan after more than 24 hours on the road. Finally, on 28 February, they got to Lviv and found a car to head to Medyka, in south-east Poland, bordering Ukraine.  But halfway to the Polish border, the traffic jam forced them to abandon the car. “So we decided to go to the border on foot,” Luo said. It was 3pm when they began to walk. They finally arrived at the border at 6am the next day.  At the border, they saw two long queues: one for Ukraine nationals, mostly women, children and elderly people, and the other for foreigners, mostly Indians and north Africans, Luo said. A day later, on 2 March, Luo and his classmate finally crossed the border, thanks to an announcement by Warsaw two days earlier that allowed Chinese nationals to enter Poland without a Schengen visa.  02:27 Discrimination and racism as people flee Ukraine shared on social media – video  Yang and Luo are safe in Poland after their ordeal. The first two flights carrying evacuees landed in China on Saturday, according to state media. But Luo said he hoped to remain in Poland because tickets to China were “way too expensive”.  “I don’t understand. China gives hundreds of millions of dollars to developing countries every year but they don’t financially help their citizens who were forced to escape [to] go back home,” Luo said. “I had never thought this would have happened to me.”  Yang, who took a Covid acid test on Sunday as a part of the pre-departure requirement, has sorted out his ticket and is looking forward to heading back home to southern China in the coming days. On Monday morning, he called his 70-year-old cello professor, who decided to stay in Ukraine, to check if he was all right.  “I said goodbye to him. I promised him that when the war is over, I’ll come back to sit in your class again to finish my education.”  * Names have been changed to protect identities

He watched his daughter Anna, 11, practice skateboarding in a park on a rainy Thursday night outside Portland, Oregon. His midnight flight will board in a few hours that will begin a long journey to the war in Ukraine. Sergey still has to pack, but he doesn’t hurry her.  Sergey, 44, has been bringing Anna here to the park for a month and each time she gets better. He watched her roll down a small hill towards him. “Come on, come on, come on …” Sergey said in Russian, smiling at the progress she’s making.  Sergey’s eldest daughter Maria, 17, was standing next to him with her hoodie pulled up. She doesn’t look at her phone, even when Anna walks back up the hill and it turn quiet between her and her father. Sergey’s mother is alone in her home outside Kyiv, hiding from shelling. Sergey wants to go home to rescue her, take her to Poland and then stay and fight.  Since the start of the Russian build up Sergey has been fixated on news, worried. On the night of the invasion Valentina Korenev, his ex-wife, texted him. He had already made his decision: he was going back to Ukraine.  “I’ve been monitoring the situation since last fall, like everybody,” Sergey said through a translator, his brother Alex Korenev. “But when it became a total invasion, I felt like I needed to do something. I could not watch it from afar.”  Sergey Korenev spends an hour skateboarding with his daughters before leaving for Ukraine.

Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images  Sergey is one of about 66,000 Ukrainians returning home to help fight the Russian invasion following President Volodymyr’s Zelenskiy’s call for s Ukrainians abroad return to the homeland to fight the Russias. Korenev, whose family is Jewish, is one Ukrainian in the US answering the call.  Later that Thursday night in his apartment in Vancouver, Washington, Sergey laid his gear on a sofa. Laptop, headphones, gloves, new boots he still has to break in, a bag of insulin for his type 2 diabetes. He’s trying to get familiar with where all the pockets are in his new military-style backpack.  He doesn’t carry much, but he takes care of what he does have. His Ukrainian passport isn’t bent or worn. Only the stamps inside it give away how much it’s seen. He folds a scarf of Dynamo Kyiv soccer club into his bag. He opens a pouch with keys to his mothers home in Kyiv, checking to see if they are still there. He zips up the pouch and places it in his bag.  “A lot of my friends are volunteers, in the territorial defense force. I can help them, because I know them, I told them I can bring what you need when you need it. So I’ve gotten a list of supplies of what they need,” he said.  Sergey sticks a small Ukrainian flag on the outside of the backpack. On a shelf obscured by a small television is a framed award, that he’s not packing, from the Ukrainian special forces recognizing him for his work with veterans.  Sergey Korenev talks on the phone with a Russian neighbor while his daughter Anna helps him prepare to leave for Ukraine. Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images  “He is a huge patriot of Ukraine,” said his brother Alex, who has lived in Vancouver, Washington, for 11 years. “He’s going there because he feels that he’s country is under assault and wants to help his brothers in arms.” Alex said his brother felt the need to help in some way after he saw his friends killed in the Maiden revolution in 2013.  When fighting broke out in the eastern region of Donetsk in 2014, Sergey and Valentina, an interior designer, started a foundation to help those fighting. They lobbied companies to donate construction materials that they could use to fix apartments.  If a father or a son was killed in action, leaving behind a family with a roof to replace and plumbing to fix, they would do it for free. If a veteran returned from the war without meaning and purpose, with just a hammer or a paint brush, Sergey and Valentina would find them one.  They even helped the nascent Ukrainian military, as at the time a special forces unit was relocated to a barracks with bare walls. “They made it livable with windows, doors, put floor in, paint it, and put some chairs and furniture,” said Alex.  But, by immigrating to the US, he and Valentina had been trying to give their daughters a shot at a better life, at more opportunity. “They wanted to try a better life, they have two young daughters and they thought it’s gonna be good for them to grow here and get good education,” said Alex. “They just won the lottery green card, if you win the lottery you use it.”  Sergey Korenev packs a pair of new combat boots before leaving for Ukraine.

Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images  Sergey has been embracing life in America’s Pacific north-west. “He’s been exploring the craft beer landscape, he’s been buying every time something new, a couple of cans and making photos and archiving it all,” said Alex.  Sergey speaks Russian at home and is still learning English. He’s taken gig economy jobs that let him work while still learning the language, driving for Uber and Doordash. “Since he’s been doing DoorDash he’s been exposed to a lot of different cuisine. For example, he’s been taking Mediterranean stuff home, Chick-fil-A and a lot of pizza,” Alex said.  Korenev is leaving home tonight on a mission with three objectives. First he’s taking $9,000 in donations from Ukrainian community in Oregon. He’s flying to New York on to pick up some more donations from friends in the Ukrainian community there. Then he’s flying to Warsaw, Poland, to cross the border over land. His second objective is to get to Kyiv as fast as possible to find his mother and get her to safety. He hopes to get her out of the country.  His final objective is to help win a war. “I’m going there to help my friends, they are my brothers in arms,” Sergey said.  One of his final acts with his family was to drop off his Mercedes SUV at his ex-wife’s home and to say goodbye.  Valentina had a gift waiting for him: a new pair of boots. He was surprised. He tried them on and then went to his bag and gave Maria the receipt for his other pair, with instructions to return them and keep the money.  Sergey Korenev says goodbye to his daughter Anna before traveling to Ukraine. Photograph: Nathan Howard/Getty Images  His ex-wife is scared for him but supports his decision. “I think it’s the right thing to do,” Valentina said. “I and our children are very worried, of course, but Ii agreed to help in any way I can. If I need to come, I will come to Ukraine. But for now, I can do more good from here.”  Near midnight, at Portland international airport, Sergey walks with his daughters and brother towards security. He takes out the dollars in his wallet and hands them to Anna to keep. He sets his bag down and picks Anna up, holding her in the air. A couple try to get past Sergey’s group and stop. One of them points to the Ukrainian flag sticking out of his bag, aware of what’s happening, and they both back away for a moment to watch Sergey say goodbye to his family.  Maria holds her younger sister, after their father has left, letting her cry in her arms.  When asked about how she feels about her dad leaving to join the war effort, Maria has a simple answer: “Scared? No, I’m proud.”

He wants Ukraine to be part of his imperium,” she said, stretching her legs as snow fell from a white sky. “He’s managed to unite the whole country against him.”  Lyskevska was travelling in a three-car family convoy. The group was part of a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to leave war-stricken Ukraine and cross the border into Poland. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, her group advanced a mere 100 metres. They had been queueing for 20 hours. Behind her, more cars arrived.  A pensioner, she set off on Friday from the southern city of Zaporizhia on the Dnipro river. Why did they escape? “The Russians were closing in. They seized our nuclear power plant,” she said. “We feared an explosion.” She left with her daughter, son-in-law, three grandkids and a dog, now being walked on the grass next to a petrol station.  Across Ukraine, millions of people are similarly on the move. As of Sunday night more than 1.7 million people have fled abroad, with 1 million crossing into Poland, according to the UN. Others had exited western Ukraine for Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. It is Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning.  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. More than 60,000 Ukrainian expats have returned home since Russia’s invasion in order to fight. A few men waiting in the queue at the Ukrainian border town of Krakovets said they would drop their families off in Poland before returning home to take up arms.  Many of those fleeing had friends and family in enemy Russia. Lyskevska said she had quarrelled with her sister who lives in St Petersburg with her Russian husband. “I rang them up. He told me the Kremlin was only bombing military infrastructure. I asked him to stop watching Russian state TV and said: ‘Our people are dying.’ He doesn’t believe me.”  “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” Lyskevska’s daughter Lena said. During their epic road trip, the family saw a rocket attack when they had parked up for the night. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said.  The route to the border follows Ukraine’s M10 highway. It passes the western city of Lviv and goes through a long stretch of thick pine forest. Along the way are several new checkpoints manned by soldiers and local militia wearing hi-vis jackets. There are sandbags, green camouflage nets, machine-gun posts and piles of logs neatly stacked next to braziers.  War feels everywhere. There is also a sense that today’s bitter conflict between Kyiv and Moscow blends with previous historic struggles. Blue and yellow flags fly next to the red and black flag of the Ukrainian insurgent army, which fought against the Red army during the second world war. Roadside billboards read: “It’s our home. We will bury you here” and “Fuck off, Russian warship”, a popular meme.  00:37 Ukraine: people fleeing country gather at Kharkiv train station – video  The 12km queue begins on a desolate stretch of road surrounded by yellow scrub and fir trees. Many cars have signs on the windscreen with the word “Deti” – children – in Russian. On Monday the queue was 1,300 vehicles long, plus 500 pedestrians. Some mothers emerged from taxis, and walked the last few kilometres, dragging along children and suitcases.  “After seven days sleeping in a Kyiv metro station, we decided to get out,” Marina Pavlova said, explaining that her 13-year-old son, Matvey, had medical issues. She added: “We are Russian speakers. We don’t need Putin to ‘save us’. We have friends like us from Kharkiv. They have vowed to only speak Ukrainian from now on because of what he has done.”  Galina Padalko, a communications manager, said she and her husband, Dmytro, left Kharkiv over the weekend, after days of bombardment that saw their flat tremble. A Grad missile landed nearby last Tuesday, blowing the leg off and killing a woman who was out buying supplies. “A couple of rockets fell not far from us. We couldn’t stand it, so we decided to evacuate,” Padalko said.  A packed train out of Kharkiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Galina Padalko  They walked for an hour and half to the train station, stood in a line for eight hours in -3C, and got on a train heading west. Padalko shared a video showing desperate passengers clambering over the rails in darkness before standing in packed carriages. “We travelled for 26 hours in an old electric train to western Ukraine. As we left, the Russian army shot at us,” she said.  Stas Mykailov said he and his wife, Daria, decided to flee after a bomb landed close to their kids’ school, in Kharkiv’s Severna Saltivka district. “I’m an engineer. I left my flat, car, job, everything. It’s gone.” The family left by train and travelled for 18 hours. “It was very hard. Some people hadn’t brought enough water. Volunteers gave us water and apples,” he said.  Mykailov said Russia was to blame for the conflict and could go “fuck itself”. “The situation is shit. I have Russian relatives. They don’t understand what’s going on here. A friend of mine called his mum in St Petersburg and she told him he was making a fuss. He shouted at her. He said he wouldn’t talk to her again until she had burned her Russian passport.”  After arranging a lift to safety for his wife and two small children, Mykailov returned to the city of Lviv, 62km from the Polish border. He checked on their progress via an app on the Telegram platform that gives real-time updates. It took them 27 hours to cross, he said. “They made it an hour ago. They were four women and three kids in a car. They will go to a hotel and sleep.”  Queues to leave Ukraine. Photograph: Daria Mykailov  He added: “At first the Polish border guard didn’t want to let them cross because the car has only five seats. Fortunately, she was a woman and she relented.”  Mykailov said since they escaped from Kharkiv, a rocket had buried itself on the roof of his apartment block. “I’m on the 11th floor. It seems we have a flat without windows. The building now has a hole,” he said.  Amid this biblical exodus, few refugees had given much thought as to what they might do in Poland. Nobody knew on Monday how long exile might last or whether Ukraine would exist as a sovereign entity by the time they returned. Many expressed support for President Zelenskiy. He has refused US offers of evacuation and has remained in Kyiv, despite great personal risk.  Lyskevska’s grandson Dmitriy Hoholenko, who is 16, said he hoped to continue studying in Poland. The war had stopped his education. He and his classmates were too young to fight. They were patriots, he said. “I hope to find a Ukrainian school somewhere in Poland,” he added in English. And long-term? “I want to be a graphic designer,” he replied.

After about 200 metres, you will see on the right-hand side of the road the unmistakable burgundy glazed tiles of a tube station. That is your destination. You can’t get on the underground here, because the station stopped accepting passengers decades ago and became a Ministry of Defence office. But it still has the platforms and shafts of a tube station, and that’s why it came to the attention of a former banker called Ajit Chambers in 2009. Chambers had a plan, which he revealed at one of the public events that Boris Johnson used to hold when he was the mayor of London.  Chambers told Johnson that he had identified 40 disused London underground stations, and he wanted to transform them into tourist attractions. “San Francisco has Alcatraz; Paris has its catacombs,” he said. “I have a proposal. I have been trying to get it to TfL.”  Johnson jumped in. “It is brilliant. I love it,” he said. “London underground. OK, we are going underground.” TfL – Transport for London, which oversees the capital’s trains, buses, taxis, trams and other modes of public transport – is one of the few bodies run by the mayor, so this was something Johnson could theoretically do something about. He promised that his staff would evaluate the proposal and follow up.  There were a few obstacles to Chambers’s plan. For one thing, although dozens of stations have been closed over the years, there aren’t 40 actual ghost stations in the sense of places you could walk into and convert into something new. Most have been demolished. For another thing, the ghost stations that do exist are still stations, packed with power lines and machinery and – at platform level – speeding trains.  Still, if anyone was going to make a go of breathing life back into the ghosts it was Chambers, who was almost comically persistent. He took to haunting Johnson’s public events, and his appearances became so predictable that a columnist at the Times called him “London’s foremost Boris-botherer”. City Hall officials would try to kill off Chambers’s idea on the grounds of health, safety, cost or something else, only for Johnson to bring it back to life by discussing it at public events.  Chambers argued that the most promising place to trial his idea was that station on the Brompton Road, which was closed in the 1930s due to lack of passengers. His vision for the site involved holographic passengers in period dress at platform level, a rooftop bar and an event space in the old ticket hall. Chambers managed to put on a handful of proof-of-concept events in the station, and people who attended them still excitedly describe the thrill of descending the old stairs to platform level, of seeing a huge map dating from when this was an anti-aircraft command post in the second world war, of the sign saying “Danger: ammunition”.  The former Brompton Rd station. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer  By 2013, it seemed as if Chambers’s persistence had won through. The fact that events were successfully held at Brompton Road suggested that Chambers’s vision of this as a future tourist attraction was not so far-fetched. It might even have been possible to make a decent profit from it. All he needed was for public officials to sign over the lease, and those years of Boris-bothering would have paid off. But that is where the plan fell apart.  The true obstacle to Chambers’s plan was not health and safety legislation or even doubts over profitability. To hand over the old Brompton Road station to Chambers, the government department that owned it – which, since the second world war had been the Ministry of Defence – would have had to overcome the reflex to sell things to the highest bidder, whoever they are and whatever their intentions. Chambers claimed to have raised £25m to back his project, but as it turned out, that wouldn’t even have bought half of the ghost on Brompton Road when it did finally change hands in early 2014.  That sale was the final act in a remarkable tale that demonstrates how Britain is prepared to welcome anybody to its shores, no questions asked, if the price is right. When the government was asked to choose between helping an entrepreneur to realise an eccentric dream that would enrich its capital city in a unique way or selling an asset to the highest bidder, there was only going to be one winner, and it wasn’t going to be Chambers.  Instead, the winner was a man named Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch who was widely seen as helping to restore Russian influence over his homeland after a popular uprising in 2004 A man who the FBI was investigating prior to his arrival in the UK and continued to investigate in the years that followed. In choosing to make the UK his second home, Firtash had picked wisely. He was welcomed with open arms – by politicians, by Cambridge University, and even by royalty.  To understand how Firtash got so rich that he could buy a tube station, we need to go back to the days of the cold war, when the Communist party still wielded unchecked power over Russia and the other Soviet republics. By the 70s, the Soviet Union, which had been seen as a great economic rival of the west in the years after the second world war, was falling rapidly behind. However, the USSR did have one thing that the west lacked: vast quantities of natural gas, which it used to power its factories, heat its homes and earn valuable dollars as exports to the west. This abundance of gas – controlled by the country’s first state-run corporation, Gazprom – helped stitch the Soviet economy together, and nowhere more so than in Ukraine, which was a centre of heavy industry second only to Russia. Ukraine’s factories and chemical works were dependent on pipelines bringing fuel from the same distant Russian and central Asian gas fields that exported gas to Europe. Thanks to this subsidised source of energy, the factories could compete with their rivals, and millions of Ukrainians had stable, well-paid jobs.  And then, in 1991, everything changed. The Soviet Union collapsed. Ukraine became independent and suddenly went from being an energy-rich country to being energy-poor. Its factories were only viable because of cheap natural gas, and it had hardly any gas of its own. Without its factories, its people would have no work; if its people had no work, its economy would collapse. Logically, one of two things should then have happened. Ukraine should either have rapidly become far more efficient in its use of gas, closing the hungrier industries, finding new ways to earn a living, so its imports and exports could balance each other, or it should have been essentially reabsorbed into Russia. The first option was economically ruinous; the second option was politically inconceivable.  Fortunately, the need to reach an immediate decision was postponed by the fact that Russia also relied on gas. Its economy survived thanks to the hard currency it earned by exporting gas to Europe, and almost all those exports passed through Ukraine. That meant that if Ukraine couldn’t pay its gas bills, it could just steal it from the pipelines that ran through its territory, and Russia couldn’t turn off the taps without also cutting off its high-paying customers farther west.  It is well established that large reserves of oil or gas almost invariably corrupt countries, and this is what happened in Ukraine. But this corruption derived not from controlling the gas, but from controlling the pipelines that moved it, and thus the ability to reward supporters with valuable shipments, or export licences. This wasn’t so much rent-seeking behaviour as toll-seeking.  Scenes from Ukraine’s Orange Revolution. Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP  Insiders in Russia and Ukraine teamed up to create shady intermediary companies that took gas from Gazprom at the Russian border, sold it to high-paying Europeans, and split the proceeds. Often, they paid for the gas not with money but with goods, and barter transactions added a layer of opacity to the deals, which made them even harder for ordinary citizens to understand. Nothing did more to corrupt Ukraine or to maintain its dependence on Moscow than its politicians’ addiction to this money. Russia added the cost of the stolen gas to Ukraine’s bill, but the insiders didn’t care, since they were allowed to keep the profits.  When Vladimir Putin became Russian president in 2000, however, he decided that – at least at the Russian end – this wealth machine needed to be brought in house. If anyone was going to get rich from exporting gas, it was going to be him and his friends, not Gazprom managers and their shady enablers. It took him a little while to wrestle the old guard out of the door, but eventually he had a loyalist in charge of the gas giant. There would still be an intermediary company between Russia and Ukraine, so the money flows would remain hidden, but that company would be half-owned by Gazprom to ensure Putin got his share. Its name was RosUkrEnergo (RUE), and it took over gas supplies between the two countries in July 2004.  That was a big year in Ukraine. In the autumn, the prime minister, a thug called Viktor Yanukovich who was heavily backed by Putin, tried to win the presidency by rigging an election. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets of Kyiv, waving the orange flags of Yanukovich’s rival Viktor Yushchenko. After weeks of continuous protests, the election was reheld and Yanukovich lost. For many young Ukrainians this moment – known as the Orange Revolution – was a glorious expression of how ordinary people can triumph over the corrupting influence of oligarchs and their money.  For Putin, however, who had spent time and money backing Yanukovich, Ukraine’s revolution was a personal humiliation. But he had a useful way to remind Ukrainians – and any other countries tempted to follow Ukraine’s lead – why humiliating the Kremlin was a bad idea. Gazprom told the post-revolutionary government it would be renegotiating its gas supply contract, and when Ukraine refused to agree to its terms, cut it off. In the depths of winter, the whole country suddenly realised quite how dependent it was on Russian goodwill. In some parts of Ukraine it was -30C. Those kinds of temperatures kill, so it was really no choice at all. Yushchenko capitulated and signed the new deal with RUE, a humiliation that split the coalition that had powered the revolution, and from which his reputation never recovered. RUE was already doing well under the old contract, and now the money really started to flow.  “Only one source of power proved to be stronger than the Orange Revolution,” wrote the scholar of international relations, Margarita M Balmaceda. “Not (former) PM Viktor Yanukovich, not Russia, but the power of energy-related interests.”  But who were those interests? Who actually were the owners of RUE? Everyone knew that Gazprom owned half of the company, but who owned the other half?  The owner of the other half of RUE, it turned out, was a 39-year-old Ukrainian man named Dmitry Firtash. According to the accounts he gave, he started out in business selling food to central Asia, but when his customers failed to pay their bills, he accepted payment in gas, which he sold at a profit in Europe. It was in this complex barter trade that he learned the skills required to run RUE.  It never became entirely clear why Putin’s Kremlin should have selected Firtash in particular to be its chosen partner in Kyiv, as opposed to one of Ukraine’s better-known oligarchs. Journalists reported his alleged links to a notorious Russian mobster Semyon Mogilevich, which might perhaps explain it, but he denied there were direct business ties between them.  Thanks to his alliance with Gazprom and by extension with Putin, Firtash had gained extraordinary wealth and power. He was the Kremlin’s man in Ukraine, a gas-fuelled kingmaker. In his home country, Firtash became a controversial figure, accused of restoring Russia’s influence over their homeland. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that he started looking around for a foreign country where he might buy a second home. He chose the UK.  I contacted Firtash to ask why he had settled on the UK, but received no answer to this, or indeed to any of the other questions I sent over via his UK partner Robert Shetler-Jones. What we know for sure is that in the years after his big gas coup, Firtash hired a lobbying company, Asquith & Granovski, to help burnish his image in the UK. The company, run by a Ukrainian spin doctor, Vladimir Granovski, and a British aristocrat and former spy, Raymond Asquith, served wealthy ex-Soviet citizens looking to engage with the UK.  In February 2007, a limited company – the British Ukrainian Society (BUS) – was incorporated. Granovski and Asquith became directors, along with Firtash’s right-hand man, Shetler-Jones, plus a Conservative MP called Richard Spring who provided Asquith & Granovski with advice on “political, economic and current affairs matters” in exchange for £35,000-40,000 a year. The society was headquartered in Knightsbridge. “Are we trying to improve our reputation? Of course,” Firtash later told the Wall Street Journal. “I can’t just be the place where people throw darts.”  Vladimir Putin with then Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller (R) and former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder arriving for the inauguration of the Nord Stream project in 2011. Photograph: Alexey Nikolsky/AFP/Getty  Another MP, a Labour backbencher called John Grogan, worked closely with the BUS. He’d become interested in Ukraine after being inspired by the Orange Revolution, and he chaired an all-party parliamentary group on the country. “I was slightly naive perhaps. At that stage I wasn’t aware of the funding arrangements,” he told me.  I asked Grogan what he thought Firtash was trying to do by supporting the British Ukrainian Society. Grogan said the model was the British Syrian Society, which had been established in 2002 by Bashar al-Assad’s father-in-law to help build links between London and Damascus and which also had Spring on the board. The BUS’s founding documents laid out objectives that were almost word for word the same as those of its Syrian counterpart.  In 2008, in his capacity as chair of the BUS, Spring secured a parliamentary debate on Ukraine, which is the kind of thing that makes any organisation look influential. In the debate he talked at length about how Britain’s interests lay in a democratic, western-oriented Ukraine free of the taint of corruption. “I suppose reputationally the kind of things the BUS did were in themselves pretty harmless – cultural events or lectures or whatever,” said Grogan. “No doubt, Firtash was trying to gain friends and influence. I have no idea if he personally met the people involved.”  It doesn’t cost much money to fund a lobbying group, and Firtash’s associates looked around for other projects, which is what took them to a dinner in 2007 in memory of the composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky at Cambridge University. According to a source with knowledge of the negotiations that followed, one of the speakers at the event mentioned that the Ukrainian language was not taught at the university, which seems to have inspired a new project for the oligarch. “Some of these British representatives associated with Firtash approached the organisers of the dinner and asked how much they would need to have Ukrainian taught in one way or another,” the source said.  A mutually acceptable total was agreed, and the university’s Slavic department organised language classes for anyone who wanted to learn Ukrainian. “That was where the first few thousand quid came from. Though whether that was actually Dmitry Firtash’s money, I don’t know. I think it was,” the source told me.  In early 2008, the DF Foundation was created with the aim of funding education about Ukraine and giving scholarships to students. In 2010, Cambridge University created a formal Ukrainian Studies course thanks to a donation from Firtash of £4m. In March 2011, Firtash was welcomed into Cambridge’s prestigious Guild of Benefactors, a club for its most generous donors, by none other than the Duke of Edinburgh.  Firtash was busy elsewhere, too: he grouped all his businesses into one holding company based in the British Virgin Islands. According to later analysis by Reuters, he was able to earn $3bn just by reselling the gas that Gazprom sold him, thanks to receiving it at an artificially low price. With billions of dollars more in loans from Gazprombank – which made him the Russian bank’s largest single borrower – he expanded fast into fertiliser, titanium, banking and the media. He had funded Yanukovich’s successful political comeback – the former prime minister won the 2010 presidential election – so had an ally running his homeland, and thanks to his philanthropy he had met the husband of the queen of his adopted second home. Everything he touched was turning to gold.  From 2011, Firtash took to visiting Cambridge quite often, meeting the students whose scholarships he was paying for and bringing along a television crew to record him doing so. The University of Cambridge gave him a special medal – containing nearly 500g of sterling silver, designed by Jane McAdam Freud and individually numbered – for his outstanding philanthropy.  In 2012, Firtash bought himself a London residence, a mansion just down the road from Harrods built by the luxury developer Mike Spink which, according to a property publication, cost something in the region of £60m. With this London base, his infiltration of the British establishment became even more ambitious.  Towards the end of 2013, he agreed another donation to Cambridge University and, in a series of events called the Days of Ukraine, opened trading on the London Stock Exchange and visited parliament with his wife, where he was greeted by the Speaker at the time, John Bercow. In a photograph of the occasion, Bercow and Firtash are shaking hands, while Lord Risby – as Richard Spring has been known since he was elevated to the House of Lords in 2010 – leans slightly forward in the background, with the kind of rapt smile you might see on the face of a proud father watching his son pick his way through a piano recital.  Back at home, however, Ukraine was entering a turbulent time. Firtash had helped Yanukovich become president in 2010 but over time, Yanukovich’s corruption became ever more blatant. He even started building a huge palace on the outskirts of Kyiv. In 2013, when Yanukovich announced he would end integration with the European Union and instead align Ukraine with Russia, it proved the final indignity. Protests swelled over subsquent months into another revolution, and, in February 2014, Yanukovich fled to Russia, while Moscow sent troops to seize the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. This was the beginning of the conflict that has escalated so horribly in the past month.  If Firtash was concerned by this turn of events, he did not show it. In February 2014, as the British government scrambled to make sense of what was happening in Ukraine, the oligarch was invited into the Foreign Office. According to a later statement in parliament, matters of national security were not discussed. However, according to a report by a Russian news agency, Firtash said that he had “tried to persuade them that imposing sanctions against Russia was a bad idea.” He added: “That will only make things worse. America provoked Putin into this situation.”  A London property owned by Dmitry Firtash. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer  Even this wasn’t quite the high-water mark of Firtash’s influence in Britain. That came three days later, when his purchase of the Brompton Road tube station for £53m from the MoD was finalised, and Ajit Chambers’s business dream was destroyed. The ghost station directly adjoined Firtash’s London property, and it’s not hard to imagine that he would have loathed Chambers’s plan to create a rooftop bar and restaurant. Late-night revellers would have had a view straight down into his back garden.  Firtash seems to have lacked any equivalent vision of his own for the site, however. The government’s press release announcing the sale made much of the station’s history and the unique features, but Firtash showed no sign of being interested in either aspect. “The whole underground station thing isn’t really that interesting,” the developer Mike Spink, who advised Firtash on the sale, wrote to me by email. “In reality, it’s just another prime central London site.”  Britain had provided Firtash with a luxury home, welcomed him into the establishment’s bosom, awarded him a medal, showered him with attention from members of both houses of parliament, sold him a central London landmark and asked him to come in and share some thoughts with the Foreign Office. In return it got money for a major university, extra cash for members of parliament, support for its property developers and millions of pounds straight into the state budget in exchange for an old tube station that the MoD wasn’t even using much.  Criticising Britain for this may seem a little unfair. After all, the argument goes, any country would have welcomed Firtash’s money and expertise, so it would have been self-defeating to turn it away, right?  This is a troubling argument. Firtash was Putin’s man in Ukraine, and yet Britain integrated him so enthusiastically into the establishment that he advised the government on Putin’s invasion. Should it really be talking to a man like this? Or accepting his money? Or selling him a property with access to the London underground system? Or, indeed anything at all?  “This has clear implications for national security,” noted parliament’s Foreign Affairs committee in 2018 about the tendency to invite Kremlin-aligned oligarchs to buy what they liked in the UK. “Turning a blind eye to London’s role in hiding the proceedings of Kremlin-connected corruption risks signalling that the UK is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Putin’s offensive measures.”  There are certainly plenty of other western countries that have helped Firtash transform himself. Cyprus, Hungary and Switzerland sold him his shell companies; Austria provided him with a bank account; ex-politicians from all over Europe have been happy to hitch their names to his various foundations. But other countries behaving badly is no reason for Britain to do so, too, not least because Firtash’s integration went so much further in the UK than it did elsewhere.  And the response of the US to his activities provides a fascinating contrast to what happened in the UK.  In 2003, the FBI indicted Semyon Mogilevich, a Moscow-based gangster, and added him to the list of its Top 10 most wanted. Mogilevich was accused of a lengthy list of crimes, including money laundering, racketeering, fraud and more. As it investigated Mogilevich’s dealings and associates, it started to look into gas shipments through Ukraine, and inevitably its attention fell on Firtash.  In April 2006, just months after Firtash’s big gas deal helped doom the prospect of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the Wall Street Journal announced that US law enforcement was investigating RUE’s ties to organised crime. The WSJ reported that Asquith had gone to Washington on Firtash’s behalf to deny any connection to Mogilevich, which is a denial that Firtash has had to make on a regular basis ever since. “There is no business connection between Mr Mogilevich and me. I have never had any direct business dealings with him, nor does he have any interests in any of my companies,” Firtash told the WSJ in 2007. According to an account of a meeting between Firtash and US officials a year later, and released by WikiLeaks: “Firtash acknowledged that he needed, and received, permission from Mogilevich when he established various businesses, but he denied any close relationship with him.” (After the cable was published, Firtash issued a statement denying he had ever acknowledged this, and suggested the claim was a “mistranslation or misunderstanding”.)  None of this lobbying succeeded in persuading US officials to stop investigating him, however. While members of the British parliament took Firtash’s money, the US embassy in Kyiv kept cabling its suspicions about what he was up to, and FBI agents kept following them up. “Given Firtash’s swift ascent from failing canned foods company manager to multi-billionaire gas magnate, he might still be beholden to the forces that helped him rise so quickly,” one cable noted laconically, after Firtash bought himself a bank.  Eventually they had enough evidence to convince a grand jury to approve an indictment. On 12 March 2014, Austrian police officers arrested Firtash in Vienna at the FBI’s request. It was exactly a fortnight after the final approval of his purchase of the Brompton Road station from the British government.  Firtash at the supreme court in Vienna on 25 June 2019. Photograph: Herbert Neubauer/AFP/Getty Images  Prosecutors accused Firtash of having bribed officials in India with more than $18.5m in order to gain access to titanium resources, which in turn he was planning to sell to Boeing. The aircraft giant’s corporate headquarters is in Chicago, and the FBI’s Illinois office was investigating. The indictment showed that the alleged scheme dated back to April 2006, and had continued for years.  Firtash fought back hard, posting bail of €125m and issuing a statement to condemn the indictment as absurd. He was being targeted for political reasons, he said, in order to allow US officials to cement their influence over his homeland’s new post-revolutionary government. “I will not allow my reputation to be ruined by those who are driven by political motivations and are not interested in Ukraine and its people,” he said in a line that was repeated in every interview he and his associates gave. Firtash was ably assisted by Tim Bell, the veteran British PR magnate behind the now defunct company, Bell Pottinger.  Apart from bland denials of such accusations, US officials were unable to respond, since they could not risk undermining their case, which is why a person with knowledge of the case was only prepared to discuss it with me anonymously. This source insisted that since the indictment had been sealed in June 2013, long before Ukrainians rose against their president, any suggestion of political motivation was ridiculous. The long delay in issuing the arrest warrant had been entirely a result of waiting for Firtash to fly to a country that might be prepared to extradite him. When he arrived in Austria, they made their move.  For a little while, despite his arrest, Firtash’s absorption into British high society continued. In mid-March, Cambridge held a ceremony to welcome his wife, Lada Firtash, into its Guild of Benefactors, but press coverage was hostile, and protesters greeted her car as it arrived at the venue. The university announced that it would only spend the most recent donation from the Firtashes if he was acquitted. It also promised to improve checks on the provenance of donations. The MoD was also challenged over why it had been prepared to sell him the Brompton Road ghost station, and similarly struggled to answer.  In parliament a minister explained that “all funds were paid to the MoD through UK regulated solicitors, in accordance with normal practice, to ensure that appropriate financial checks were made on their client”. The fact that US authorities were investigating Firtash’s companies had been reported in the press years previously, so this was not a convincing argument. The British government’s focus had been on making as much money as possible, and it had actually subcontracted its checks on the origin of that money to Firtash’s own lawyers while ignoring anything that stood in the way of closing the sale. It wasn’t a good look, and it left the MPs and peers who had so willingly accepted the money with some explaining to do.  Many of the details about what Firtash has done in the UK are known thanks to Helen Goodman, a Labour MP until 2019, who became the party’s expert on Ukraine. She said that parliamentarians involved in the British Ukrainian Society had offered to pay for her to go to Kyiv, saying the money came from “somebody in oil and gas”, but she turned the offer down and arranged her own transport. “It was just obvious that Firtash was corrupting Ukrainian politics, and equally clear that Firtash has an agenda,” she told me. “The thing seemed to stink. Every aspect of it seemed really weird.”  Asquith did not respond to my many emails or phone calls, and neither did Lord Risby. One parliamentarian involved in the British Ukrainian Society did agree to talk to me, provided I didn’t identify them in any way, but seemed ignorant about the fact that Firtash was involved in creating the society. “You might say I’m a bit of a useful idiot, but this didn’t occur to me,” the individual said.  A politician who was prepared to talk to me on the record was the Conservative MP John Whittingdale. He did not end his connection to the BUS until long after Firtash’s arrest and accepted more than £3,000 in donations to fund a trip to a 2015 conference held in Vienna and addressed by Firtash. A contemporary statement on Firtash’s website made much of the fact that Whittingdale had attended. I asked Whittingdale – who at the time of our conversation was culture minister in the UK government, but at the time of the conference was just a backbench MP – whether he was concerned that his involvement had given Firtash a degree of credibility that he otherwise would have lacked.  “Do you think so? I’m not sure that it gives him much credibility. Goodness, one meets a lot of people. Just meeting them I don’t think enables them to claim any credit. I was briefly director of the British Ukrainian Society, but it is very much an arm’s length operation,” he said. “I am aware of the support for Oxford university, or Cambridge, whichever it is. That’s a matter for them … We are a free society, and as long as it’s legal, it’s up to them.”  And the tube station? Wasn’t he worried about potentially tainted money being used to buy property from the British government? “That’s not a bribe or anything, it’s a commercial transaction,” he said. “I am dimly aware that he did buy a tube station somewhere in west London to turn it into a property or something, I don’t know the detail at all. At the moment he’s sitting in Austria somewhere, but there are much more dodgy–” he stopped and appeared to reconsider what he was about to say. “If Ukrainians come and produce evidence for instance that his money had been illegally acquired, or stolen from the people, then obviously that would be something we should look into, and if proven then take action over. But as far as I’m aware they haven’t, and there are plenty of other oligarchs who have money in London ... Nobody in Ukraine has ever expressed any concern about this.”  That last remark stayed with me because it was so at variance with my own experience. I have reported on Ukraine for years, and many people I have spoken to have expressed concern about Britain giving a safe haven to oligarchs and their money. Whittingdale said Ukrainian prosecutors would have to win a case against Firtash if they wanted Britain to act, but those prosecutors are so demoralised, corrupted and out-resourced that such a victory is an impossible dream. Even if they do bring a prosecution, cases from other countries show that the oligarch concerned would simply argue that the proceedings were politically motivated and claim asylum in the west. If an oligarch is not prosecuted, Britain doesn’t investigate; if the oligarch is prosecuted, Britain doesn’t investigate either. The fact that a government minister fails to acknowledge this “heads they win, tails we lose” injustice helps explain why Britain has consistently failed to interrogate the origins of suspect wealth.  At present, Firtash is still in Vienna and still battling extradition to the US. His extradition hearings have bounced between courts, with different Austrian judges ruling different ways, while in Chicago his US-based lawyers have sought to have the whole case thrown out. A number of US citizens have happily taken Firtash’s money to lobby on his behalf, but prosecutors are sticking to their task and still hope he’ll arrive in Chicago eventually.  Britain, meanwhile, is failing to seize the assets of Putin’s oligarchs, to the incredulity of its allies in Europe and the US. What they need to understand is that this failure is not the fruit of a political decision, but of a decades-long policy to accept money without asking where it came from. Britain literally lacks the mechanisms to do what politicians suddenly want to do. If we want this to change, we will need to build the state capacity – and the political will – from the ground up.

The intelligence arm of the Ukrainian defence ministry said Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, had been killed outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers.  The ministry also broadcast what it claimed was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine.  01:09 'Not afraid of anyone': Zelenskiy says he will stay in Kyiv until war is won – video  The investigative journalism agency Bellingcat said it had confirmed Gerasimov’s death with a Russian source. Its executive director, Christo Grozev, said they had also identified the senior FSB officer in the intercepted conversation.  Gerasimov took part in the second Chechen war, the Russian military operation in Syria, and the annexation of Crimea, winning medals from those campaigns.  If confirmed, Gerasimov would be the second Russian general from the 41st Army to die within a week in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. At the beginning of March, its deputy commander, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, was confirmed by Russian media to have been killed.  The loss of top ranking officers has come at a time when much of Putin’s invasion force has become bogged down by logistical problems, poor morale and Ukrainian resistance. The failure of its encrypted communications system could be another severe blow.  “In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working,” Grozev said on Twitter. “Era is a super expensive cryptophone system that [Russia’s defence ministry] introduced in 2021 with great fanfare. It guaranteed [to] work ‘in all conditions’.”  On Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the war was “like a nightmare” for Russia and hailed the Ukrainian resistance effort.  His comments came after Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, accused Vladimir Putin of having a plan to “brutalise Ukraine” by shelling cities.

Open source analysts and military experts first spotted the mysterious Z-shaped letter hand-painted on Russian tanks and military trucks massed on the Ukrainian border on 19 February, leading to widespread speculation among western experts as to what the letter meant.  As Russia’s invasion began, more military hardware was spotted emblazoned with Zs, as well as other letters, including O, X, A and V. The letters seen on the hardware were usually framed by squares, triangles, and other painted shapes. The letter Z does not exist in the Cyrillic Russian alphabet.  The most popular theory used by military experts to explain the letters is that they were written according to the respective areas where the Russian troops are usually stationed, with Z potentially standing for Zapad (west).  Others believe the letters were drawn in an attempt to avoid friendly fire, while some pro-Kremlin Russian military experts have speculated that the letter Z stands for the name of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the letter V for Vladimir Putin.  The Russian defense ministry itself has not commented on any of the theories, and instead posted on its Instagram channel that Z meant Za pobedu (“for victory”) and V stood for “power of truth”.  How has Z become the symbol of the war in Russia?  In the past two weeks, Z has gone from a military marking to the main symbol of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Just three days after the invasion, the Kremlin-funded state network RT announced on its social media channels that it was selling Z merchandise, including T-shirts and hoodies, to show support for Russian troops. Since then, countless flashmobs across the country have been organised by the authorities, in which young Russians are seen wearing a Z shirt while displaying their support for the war. The Z letter has also been painted on large Soviet-era apartment blocks and posted on street advertisement signs.  A number of schools have also posted images of children standing in a Z formation. One image that has been circulating online since Sunday showed terminally ill children from a hospice in the southern city of Kazan forming a Z to support the invasion of Ukraine.  Officials eager to show their support for the war have even pledged to include the letter in the names of their region. Sergei Tsivilev, head of the Kemerovo region, announced that he had decided to rename the region and add the letter Z to the region, which might now be listed as KuZbass.  The symbol has also had some limited exposure outside Russia. On Friday, thousands of Serbs waving Russian flags and carrying Z letters marched through Belgrade to the Russian embassy in a show of public support for Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine. And on Saturday, the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak sported the Z insignia as he stood next to Ukraine’s Kovtun Illia, the gold medallist at a gymnastics World Cup event in Doha.  00:42 Russian gymnast shows ‘Z’ symbol on podium next to Ukrainian winner – video  How has Russian society reacted to Z?  Walking around Moscow, one occasionally spots cars with a Z painted on them, but the sign is yet to see genuine widespread use among the Russian population.  Russia has a history of promoting certain signs and symbols to gather support for its military. During the country’s annexation of Crimea, Russia heavily promoted the use of the orange- and black-striped ribbons of Saint George. The ribbon now enjoys wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the Russian government and the military.  Some Russians, however, have ridiculed Z. During Sunday’s countrywide rallies against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, some protesters were seen holding signs with the word Zachem (For what?). Russians have also taken to the internet to post various memes satirising Z. In one, Harry Potter is seen showing Ron his lightning-shaped scar, which has been modified to show the letter Z.  More ominously, Z has been used as an intimidation tactic against those who oppose the war. Members of the opposition art collective Pussy Riot, as well as the anti-war NGO Memorial, have said the Z symbol was painted on the door of their flat.

The UN agency said it was working to urgently get medical supplies to Ukraine. Among the supplies running low are oxygen, insulin, PPE, surgical supplies and blood products.  The European Commission has prepared a new sanctions package against Russia and Belarus that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians as well as three Belarusian banks, Reuters reports. Sources told the news agency that the sanctions, to be discussed by EU ambassadors today at a meeting at 2pm GMT, would ban three Belarusian banks from the Swift banking system and add more Russian oligarchs and politicians to the EU blacklist.  Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has reported that 12,000 Russian personnel have been killed in its latest assessment of their losses to date. They said so far Russian forces had also lost 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 1,036 armed vehicles, 120 artillery pieces and 27 anti-aircraft warfare systems.  The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, says the number of people who have left Ukraine since Russia’s invasion today reached 2 million.  Russia has reportedly opened humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol so that civilians can be evacuated. The Russian defence ministry made the announcement today, Reuters reports, citing the Interfax news agency. The defence ministry also reportedly said Russian forces in Ukraine had introduced a “silent regime” from 0700 GMT.  A Ukrainian deputy prime minister has warned that although the first stage of Sumy’s evacuation has begun, Russia is “preparing to disrupt” the corridors being used by evacuees. Irina Vereshchuk said: “The Russian side is preparing to disrupt the work of humanitarian corridors and manipulate the route to force people to go the other way.” She later announced that a second humanitarian corridor had been launched between Mariupol and Zaporizhia. The evacuation of civilians from Irpin, near Kyiv, is also under way, reports Reuters, citing a Ukrainian official.

Kuliak’s shirt had the letter Z prominently placed as he stood next to Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun, the gold medallist at a Gymnastics World Cup event in Doha.  The 'Z', a letter that does not exist in the Cyrillic Russian alphabet, has been seen daubed on Russian tanks and vehicles in Ukraine and has come to symbolise support for the invasion.  Kuliak, a former all-around and floor national junior champion, had won the bronze medal on Saturday.

Lytovchenko said she was inspired in seeing one of her students play in a makeshift bomb shelter at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  ‘It was very difficult to play and think about something that wasn’t war. But I decided I must do something,’ Lytovchenko said. ‘We have become a family in this cellar and when I played they cried. They forget about the war for some moments and think about something else.’  Video of Lytovchenko playing Ніч яка місячна (The Night is So Moonlit) has gone viral on Twitter, but Lytovchenko said she is mainly interested about her friends’ and colleagues’ reactions on Facebook because that is how she knows they are still alive.  Lytovchenko said she would stay in Kharkiv to rebuild the city. ‘I won’t just play,’ she said. ‘This is my land. I want to help rebuild the city with my own hands.  ‘I don’t need pity. I don’t need to complain. I just need the bombing to stop then we will rebuild. I need the war to end’

The footage, first posted by Radio Free Europe (RFE) on Monday, showed a fiery exchange between Sergei Tsivilyov, the governor of the Kemerovo region, and people in the city of Novokuznetsk.  “They lied to everyone, they deceived everyone ... Why did you send them there?” one woman asks Tsivilyov, saying that the soldiers thought they were going for military drills in Belarus.  “They didn’t know their objectives ... They were sent as cannon fodder,” the woman adds.  According to RFE, the confrontation took place on 5 March at the gymnasium of the training base for riot police units, some of whose officers were killed or captured in Ukraine.

The White House said Biden was scheduled to announce unspecified actions against Russia over its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, in remarks at 10:45 a.m. (1545 GMT) on Tuesday.  Russia is the world's biggest exporter of oil and natural gas, and until now its energy exports had been exempted from international sanctions. Although the United States is not a leading buyer of Russian oil, its allies are likely to come under pressure to also wean their economies off Russian energy.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Two people familiar with the matter had told Reuters on Monday that Washington was willing to move ahead with the ban without allies in Europe. A reporter for Politico said Britain was expected to announce steps on Tuesday to reduce dependency on Russian energy. read more  The U.S. announcement will intensify the impact of the war on a global economy already suffering supply shortages and price surges as it lurches out of the pandemic crisis. In the United States, gas pump prices have already hit a record since Russia launched the invasion, worsening inflation that was already at 40 year highs.  U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, said the administration was coordinating with European allies "and making sure that we've done the groundwork to understand how to effectively implement a ban on Russian energy."  "We are going to see increased gas prices here in the United States. In Europe, they will see dramatic increases in prices. That's the cost of standing up for freedom and standing alongside the Ukrainian people, but it's going to cost us," Coons told CNN.  In Ukraine, Kyiv accused Moscow of shelling a humanitarian corridor it had promised to open to let residents flee the besieged port of Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering under relentless bombardment without water or power for more than a week.  "Ceasefire violated! Russian forces are now shelling the humanitarian corridor from Zaporizhzhia to Mariupol," Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Twitter, adding that 30 buses had been sent for evacuations.  "Pressure on Russia MUST step up to make it uphold its commitments."  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a child had died of dehydration in Mariupol because water was cut off. The claim could not be independently verified.  Russia opened a separate corridor allowing residents out of the eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday, the first successful evacuation under such a safe route.  Buses left Sumy for Poltava further West, only hours after a Russian air strike, which regional officials said had hit a residential area and killed 21 people. Russia denies targeting civilians.  The number of refugees who have fled Ukraine had surged past 2 million, in what the United Nations describes as one of the fastest exoduses in modern times. read more  Residents were also leaving the town of Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb where Reuters journalists had filmed families fleeing for their lives under fierce bombardment on Sunday. Residents ran with children in strollers or cradling babies in arms, while others carried pets and plastic bags of belongings.  1/15 Destroyed Russian tanks are seen, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in the Sumy region, Ukraine, March 7, 2022.

Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special operation" to disarm its neighbour and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a baseless pretext to invade a country of 44 million people.  SANCTIONS  Western sanctions have cut off Russia from international trade and financial markets to a degree never before imposed on such a big economy.  Britain's Shell, (SHEL.L) one of several Western oil majors to announce it is pulling out of Russian projects, went further on Tuesday, saying it would no longer buy any Russian oil or gas and apologising for buying a Russian crude shipment last week.  The war could also worsen global shortages of other commodities since both Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of food and metals. Trade in London of the industrial metal Nickel was suspended on Tuesday after prices doubled within hours.  CORRIDORS  Corridors to let civilians escape and allow aid reach besieged areas have been the main subject of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations.  Russia's Interfax news agency said Moscow was opening humanitarian corridors for the cities of Sumy, Mariupol, Cherhihiv, Kharkiv and the capital Kyiv. Ukraine has rejected Russian proposals for Kharkiv and Kyiv that would lead evacuees to Russia or its ally Belarus. Earlier attempts to evacuate residents from Mariupol failed on Saturday and Sunday, with each side accusing the other of continuing to fire.  Western countries say Russia's initial battle plan for a rapid strike to topple the Kyiv government failed in the early days of the war, and Moscow has adjusted tactics for longer sieges of cities.  "The tempo of the enemy's advance has slowed considerably, and in certain directions where they were advancing it has practically stopped," Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told a televised briefing on Tuesday.  Ukraine's defence ministry said Vitaly Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, had been killed on Monday, the second Russian major general killed since the invasion began. Russia's defence ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.  The main Russian assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital. But to the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts.  Within Russia, the war has led to a severe new crackdown on dissent, with the last remaining independent media largely shut last week and foreign broadcasters banned. Many foreign news organisations have suspended reporting after a new law imposed jail terms for reporting deemed to discredit the military.  The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said 12,700 people in Russia had already been detained at anti-war demonstrations.

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko  LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The possibility that the United States might ban Russian oil imports has triggered a surge in Brent crude to almost $140 a barrel, its highest level since 2008. read more  Russia is the world's top exporter of crude and oil products combined, at around 7 million barrels per day (bpd ) or 7% of global supply. Such a ban would be unprecedented, turbocharging already sky-high prices and risking inflationary shock.  Here are some of the likely consequences of a ban:  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  RECORD PRICES  Western governments have not directly sanctioned Russia's energy sector but some customers are already shunning its oil to avoid becoming entangled in legal troubles later.  JP Morgan predicts oil could hit a record $185 a barrel by the end of 2022 if disruption to Russian exports lasts that long, although along with most analysts polled by Reuters the bank expects a yearly average price below $100. read more  The last time oil prices were above $100 was in 2014 and levels reached on Monday were not far shy of a peak of more than $147 hit in July 2008. That is a steep climb from two years ago, when a coronavirus-driven demand slump saw a barrel of West Texas crude at below $0 as sellers had to pay to get rid of it.  "A prolonged war which causes widespread disruption to commodity supplies could see Brent moving above the $150 a barrel mark," Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS, said.  INFLATIONARY SHOCK  With natural gas prices hitting all-time highs, soaring energy costs are expected to push inflation above 7% on both sides of the Atlantic in the coming months and eat deep into households’ purchasing power.  As a rule of thumb, every 10% rise in the oil price in euro terms increases euro zone inflation by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point. Since Jan 1, Brent crude is up around 80% in euros. In the U.S., every $10 per barrel rise in oil prices increases inflation by 0.2 percentage point.  In addition to being a major supplier of oil and gas, Russia is also the world's largest grains and fertilisers exporter and a top producer of palladium, nickel, coal and steel. The bid to exclude its economy from the trading system will hit a wide range of industries and add to global food security fears.  HIT TO GROWTH  A ban on Russian oil would further slow the nascent global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.  Preliminary calculations by the European Central Bank (ECB) suggest that war could cut euro zone growth by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points this year in a baseline scenario and 1 percentage point in case of a severe shock.  In the coming months, there is a high risk of stagflation, or little to minimal growth coupled with high inflation. However, further, euro zone growth is likely to remain robust, even if commodity prices prove a drag.  In the U.S., the Fed estimates that every $10 per barrel rise in oil prices cuts growth by 0.1 percentage point, though private forecasters see a more muted impact.  In Russia, the damage is likely to be large and immediate. JPMorgan estimates that its economy will contract by 12.5% from peak to trough.  CENTRAL BANK IMPACT  For the U.S. Federal Reserve, the inflationary impact has already proved too great and its Chair Jerome Powell has said that interest rates need to rise this month, piling pressure on borrowers. read more  For the ECB, the urgency of policy action is less acute as the labour market still enjoys spare capacity and there is little home-grown inflation.  "No one can seriously expect the ECB to start normalising monetary policy at such a moment of high uncertainty," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.  SUBSTITUTES?  With fossil fuel demand rebounding from the pandemic but supply around the world still tight, policymakers will be under pressure to ramp up supply despite pledges to back green energy.  "There will be a dial back on green initiatives in the short term in an attempt to reverse the contraction we've seen in fossil fuel supplies," Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.  Talks to unleash Iran from international sanctions are in advanced stages and high oil prices are set to galvanize investment in U.S. shale, but supply may not be set to come online soon enough to replace Russian output.  "The potential supply impacts are so large that there isn’t a quick way to substitute in the medium term, meaning the only mitigant will be price inflation of these inputs and the products that depend on them," said Alex Collins, senior corporate analyst at BlueBay Asset Management.  THE LONG VIEW  The Russian-Western impasse could invigorate Moscow's relationship with Beijing but the energy infrastructure between the two countries is scant.  "Although Russia's Pivot to the East has accelerated gas cooperation with China via gas infrastructure ... all these developments are still in their infancy compared to the mature markets in Europe," said Kaho Yu, principal Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.  Renewables could get a boost in the medium- to long-run as countries seek to wean themselves off Russian energy.  "We should take the subsidies we now devote to natural gas, coal, and petroleum and put them into renewable energy generation, electric mobility and EV charging infrastructure, heat pumps, building efficiency upgrades," said Wolfgang Ketter, professor at the Rotterdam School of Management at Erasmus University in the Netherlands.  "Anything that will lead to long term energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependency."

"I would support the Poles and whatever choice they make," Wallace told Sky News, adding that the United Kingdom could not offer aircraft that the Ukrainians would be able to use.  "We would protect Poland, we'll help them with anything that they need," he said. "Poland will understand that the choices they make will not only directly help Ukraine, which is a good thing, but also may bring them into direct line of fire from countries such as Russia or Belarus."  Britain has provided Ukraine with defensive weapons as well as other military and humanitarian aid.  Wallace said he would make a statement to parliament on Wednesday setting out what further lethal and non-lethal aid Britain would be providing, as well as what measures the British government would urge other countries to do.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson  LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) was forced to halt trading in nickel and said it would cancel trades as prices doubled to more than $100,000 per tonne on Tuesday, a surge sources blamed on short covering by one of the world's top producers.  The trading shutdown after Western sanctions threatened supply from major producer Russia is the biggest crisis to hit the 145-year-old exchange in decades.  In the 1990s a rogue Sumitomo trader tried to corner the copper market and tin trading was stopped for five years in the 1980s.

"The current events are unprecedented," the LME said in a notice to members. "The suspension of the nickel market has created a number of issues for market participants which need to be addressed."  Some position holders have been struggling to pay margin calls, traders said.  China's Tsingshan Holding Group, one of the world's top nickel and stainless steel producers, had been building a short position in nickel since last year, betting prices would fall, three sources familiar with the matter said. read more  Prices rocketed as Tsingshan bought large amounts of nickel to reduce those short bets and its exposure to costly margin calls, they said.  Tsingshan and the LME declined to comment.  The LME raised margin requirements for nickel contracts by 12.5% to $2,250 a tonne and suspended trading of nickel on all venues for at least the rest of the day. read more  "For the LME to stop trading for an entire day, that doesn’t help its long-term relevance," said Colin Hamilton, managing director of commodities research at BMO Capital Markets. "This is meant to be a market of last resort and people can't get inventories to deliver against positions."  The LME announced that all trades will be voided from midnight until 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday when trading stopped and added that it was considering a closure of several days.  In another rare move, it also deferred physical delivery of maturing contracts.  "The LME will actively plan for the reopening of the nickel market, and will announce the mechanics of this to the market as soon as possible."  Three-month nickel on the LME more than doubled to $101,365 a tonne before the LME halted trade on its electronic systems and in the open outcry ring.  Nickel had pared gains to $80,000 a tonne when trading was halted, up 66% on the day and a staggering 177% since Monday.  LME nickel suspended after it doubles  MARKET BATTLE  The explosive gains, which have seen prices quadruple over the past week, resulted from two major players facing off, said Malcolm Freeman of Kingdom Futures, who declined to identify them.  One entity has control of between 50% and 80% of LME inventories, LME data shows.  "There's a very big short and a very big long who've been sparring. And because of their sparring, it's brutalised so many other shorts," said Freeman.  Some small industrial users have been caught in the crossfire, having taken positions to get physical delivery but then hit with margins calls costing millions of dollars, he added. read more  The uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion and resulting sanctions has added to an already bullish nickel market due to low inventories, which have halved on the LME since October.  Russia not only supplies about 10% of the world's nickel but Russia's Nornickel is the world's biggest supplier of battery- grade nickel at 15%-20% of global supply, said JPMorgan analyst Dominic O'Kane.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin (RUSSIA - Tags: ENERGY BUSINESS INDUSTRIAL POLITICS)  BRUSSELS, March 8 (Reuters) - The European Commission published plans on Tuesday to cut the EU's dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel "well before 2030".  The European Union executive said it will do so by switching to alternative supplies and expanding clean energy more quickly under the plans, which will largely be the responsibility of national governments for implementing.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine last month has triggered an overhaul of the 27-country EU's energy priorities as Brussels seeks to wrest countries free from depending on Russia, which supplies around 40% of the bloc's natural gas.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The new plans come on top of climate change policies the EU is currently negotiating, which are designed to cut emissions faster this decade and would alone cut EU gas use 30% by 2030.  The Commission said gas and liquefied natural gas from countries like the United States and Qatar could this year replace more than a third, 60 billion cubic metres (bcm), of the 155 bcm Europe gets annually from Russia. And by 2030, increased biomethane and hydrogen use could also help.  New wind and solar projects could replace 20 bcm of gas demand this year, while tripling capacity by 2030, adding 480GW of wind and 420GW of solar energy, could save 170 bcm a year.  Turning down thermostats by 1°C could save an extra 10 bcm this year, while by 2030, replacing gas boilers with 30 million heat pumps could save a further 35 bcm, the Commission added.  Reuters Graphics  Some countries are seeking more EU funding to protect consumers from soaring European gas prices, which hit fresh highs this week.  Countries can tax energy companies' profits from high gas prices, to offset higher electricity bills, the Commission said. The International Energy Agency has said such taxes could raise 200 billion euros ($218 billion) this year.  Gas flows to Europe have so far been steady since the invasion, which Russia calls a "special military operation".  However, Moscow on Monday warned that Western sanctions on Russian oil - an idea supported by the United States, but which has split EU nations - could prompt it to close a major gas pipeline to Europe.  The EU will also propose rules by April requiring EU countries to fill gas storage 90% by Oct. 1 each year. EU storage is currently 27% full.  Europe has enough gas in storage and supply from other countries to see it through this winter, but analysts say a prolonged halt to Russian imports would hit Europe's economy and require emergency measures such as factory closures.

Better start putting more cash aside.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ramping up the price of metals used in cars, from aluminium in the bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters to the high-grade nickel in electric vehicle batteries, and drivers are likely to foot the bill.  While metals have not been the target of Western sanctions yet, some shippers and autoparts suppliers are already steering clear of Russian goods, putting more pressure on carmakers already reeling from a chip shortage and higher energy prices.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "So what happens from here?" asked Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis (STLA.MI), the world's fourth-biggest automaker, when speaking to reporters last week.  "First, what happens is that we have an escalation of cost that comes from raw materials and energy that is going to put more pressure on the business model," he said.  Aluminium and palladium both hit record highs on Monday while nickel , which is also used to make stainless steel, crossed the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time ever on Tuesday. read more  Andreas Weller, chief executive of Aludyne, which makes aluminium and magnesium die-cast parts for automakers, said his European business has seen a 60% rise in the cost of aluminium over the past four months, as well as soaring energy bills.  With annual sales of $1.2 billion and a surge of costs in the "hundreds of millions of dollars", Weller, whose company is based in Southfield, Michigan, said he has been forced to ask customers to pay more than the prices already agreed.  "Some are more understanding and cooperative than others, but we cannot survive without that," Weller, who has four foundries and one machining plant in Europe, told Reuters.  Stellantis chief executive Tavares said an end to the chip shortage could help carmakers offset higher metal and energy prices, but he did not expect any resolution to the semiconductor issues this year.  'WE QUIT'  Consumers are already paying for the chip shortage as it has pushed car inventories down and prices up - even before higher metals prices feed through to the forecourt.  According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the United States was $44,460 in February, up 18.5% from the same month in 2021.  German carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW have already been hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as it has forced makers of wire harnesses in the west of the country to halt production. A wire harness is a vital set of parts which neatly bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car - and Ukraine is a key supplier. read more  And when it comes to metals, Russia companies are major suppliers to Germany. In 2020, they accounted for 44% of Germany's nickel imports, 41% of its titanium, a third of its iron, and 18% of its palladium.  With production of 108 million tonnes last year, Russia is the world's fifth-largest producer of iron ore, according to Credit Suisse, supplying European steelmakers who now face higher prices and possible difficulties procuring the metal.  Austria's Voestalpine and Sweden's SSAB (SSABa.ST) are both exposed to this risk, according to U.S. investment bank JPMorgan.  Voestalpine said it had enough inventory for the coming months, but expected it would have to source raw materials from other suppliers thereafter. SSAB did not respond to a request for comment about supplies from Russia.  Ingots of 99.98% and 99.97% pure palladium are seen at the Krastsvetmet non-ferrous metals plant in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia November 22, 2018. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin  Faced with the choice of buying Russian goods and indirectly funding Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, Germany steel and aluminium supplier Voss Edelstahlhandel has decided to draw the line.  "Even though aluminium is not on the sanctions list, it is used by Russia to get money into the country and therefore we quit," Chief Executive Thorsten Studemund told Reuters.  Russia is a big manufacturer of aluminium, the most energy-intensive metal to produce, accounting for 6% of global output.  'BATTERY MINERAL WOES'  Studemund's company has also been contending with high prices for nickel.  Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at specialist consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), said that while Russia accounts for 5% of global nickel production, it supplies about 20% of the world's high-grade nickel.  The metal is used to make batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), posing a fresh challenge for carmakers already investing billions to move away for combustion engines just as demand for zero-emission models is starting to take off.  Some of Russia's high-grade nickel will probably end up in China, which is unlikely to impose sanctions on Russia, but this all comes at a time when carmakers are facing rising bills for other EV battery minerals as demand outstrips supply.  "That's the main concern for the battery supply chain in that you've got record high lithium prices, and very, very high cobalt and nickel prices," Rawles said. "This is just adding to battery mineral woes."  Batteries are one the most expensive components in EVs and automakers have been hoping they will become cheaper so they can offer more affordable electric cars.  BMW said it was focusing as much as possible on recycling battery nickel, with up to 50% scrap nickel used in the high-voltage battery of its new BMW iX model.  When it comes to palladium, carmakers are also in a bind.  The auto industry uses it in catalytic converters for gasoline models - or platinum for diesel models - both of which still make up the vast majority of car sales.  Palladium prices have been rising for about six years and Russia accounts for about 40% of the global market.  "There is no other option beyond palladium and platinum for catalytic converters, and you can't build a car without a catalytic converter," said Chris Blasi, chief executive of precious metals dealer Neptune Global.  He said he bought a lot of palladium in December at $1,940 an ounce. On Monday, it hit a record $3,440.  Blasi estimated that the value of the palladium used in the average car is about $200, but that could easily double.  "Either consumers will pay more for cars, or if automakers can't pass it on they'll have to find cost savings somewhere else," he said.

The surging price of crude oil on world markets has led to the biggest ever weekly jump in gasoline prices at some service stations around Europe, pushing them in some cases above 2 euros for a litre ($8.25/gallon) of unleaded fuel.  "The problem is not the price it will be tomorrow, but how much it (gasoline) will cost 15 days from now, we think that it is going to cost much more. I think bad times are ahead of us," 76-year-old Madrid pensioner Alejandro Oterino said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  That fear of prices spiralling out of control is precisely what the European Central Bank must allay at its meeting on Thursday. ECB chief Christine Lagarde will aim to prove it can keep a lid on euro-area inflation that had already leapt to a higher than expected 5.8% ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  "There is a natural pressure on central banks to keep (inflation) expectations low via communication but at the same time they risk losing credibility," said Gunther Schnabl, economics professor at Leipzig University.  In Portugal - western Europe's poorest country with 10% of the population on a minimum wage of 705 euros - motorists have been rushing to fill tanks before any more price hikes come in. A diesel car with a 50-litre tank costs 91 euros to fill up.  "If the prices keep rising, I might have to resort to social services to eat and drink," said 56-year-old Uber driver Antonio Dias in Lisbon.  "If this continues it will not make sense to continue doing this type of work," he said, urging the government to cut fuel taxes which currently amount to some 50% of gasoline end-prices.  Knock-on impacts are being felt already. Teresa Soares, who sells food products to restaurants in the Portuguese capital, said she had no alternative to her car for making deliveries, so would just have to shoulder the extra cost on her business.  "If this was my private car, I would probably put it aside and not drive it," said Soares, 53.  German motoring organisation ADAC estimated that diesel prices had spiked a massive 28% in six days from March 1. Heating oil prices are also rising as homeowners are stepping up purchases of the oil, still used by many Germans to heat their houses.  "Many users fear supply bottlenecks due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and are now filling their (heating oil) tanks while we are still in winter, which they usually don't do," it said.  "STAGFLATION" SPECTRE  For now, increases in the end-prices of food have been less dramatic. But with Ukraine and Russia both exporters of grain, and Russia a major supplier of fertilisers, concern is growing that this will add to inflationary pressures as the war goes on.  Some Spanish supermarkets including market leader Mercadona are restricting sales of sunflower oil, which mostly comes from Ukraine, after detecting what the ASEDAS supermarket sector body called "atypical consumer behaviour".  Spain's Agriculture Ministry urged calm and said there were no shortages for now.  The fear now is that this will hit consumer spending even harder, especially among the low-income households who fared worst during pandemic lockdowns in which they did not benefit from furloughs or faced other hits to their livelihoods.  In Britain, the Resolution Foundation think tank estimated the conflict would lead to wider inflation, shaving 4% off the real level of typical household incomes over the coming year, the sharpest fall in nearly half a century.  Italy's Economy Ministry said in a report on Monday that "the surge in energy prices and the consequent rise in inflation represent a strong risk for citizens' economic wellbeing."  This is all raising the spectre of "stagflation", the combination of inflation and economic slowdown commonly associated with the early 1970s and which central banks and governments find so difficult to cure.  In light of the conflict, ECB policymakers are tussling over whether to pause moves to wind down the unprecedented amount of stimulus they have used to prop up the euro economy over the past decade - a period in which the euro zone slowly emerged from a global recession only to land up in a new pandemic-era collapse.  University of Leipzig's Schnabl said that with governments now inevitably having to pump more support into the economy to help the worst-hit, the only way to avoid a vicious circle of more inflation was for the bank to pursue its tightening path.  "The very important policy consequence from my point of view is to stop central bank-financed government expenditure," he said. "And that will only work based on a very slow but really decisive monetary policy tightening process."

Eleven months of negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme have reached their final stages.  Iran has sought to remove all sanctions and it wants guarantees from the United States that it will not abandon the deal once more, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump walked out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Iran's top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, returned to Tehran on Monday for consultations.  "The government pursues nuclear negotiations in full accordance with the principles and framework set by the Supreme Leader," Raisi said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in Tehran's decision.  "It has not and will not back down on any of these red lines," the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Raisi as saying.  Talks coordinator Enrique Mora of the European Union said on Monday that the political decisions needed to conclude the negotiations successfully must be taken in the next few days.  Diplomats say several differences still need to be overcome in the talks, which were also hit by a last-minute demand from Russia for a guarantee from the United States that Russian trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken played down the issue during a visit to Estonia, saying Russia has a self-interest in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear arms.  "We continue to work to see if we can come back to mutual compliance with Iran on the deal. Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts and it has its own interest in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon," Blinken said. read more  Should the talks collapse, it could carry the risk of Tehran getting to within a short sprint of nuclear weapons and igniting a fresh war in the Middle East. It could also prompt the West to impose more harsh sanctions on Iran and further escalate world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict.  Parties involved in the talks said last week that a deal was expected to be reached within days.  European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran would be rolled back.  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is under U.S. sanctions, successfully put a second military satellite into orbit, state media said on Tuesday, in what would be another advance for Iran's military. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Dubai Newsroom and Simon Lewis and Andrius Sytas in Tallinn; Writing by Dominic Evans Editing by Catherine Evans, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Nick Macfie  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

"United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine," Turchak said.  "This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate being stabbed in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, not against Russia as a whole, but against our citizens," he said.  "We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war," Turchak said.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo  BRUSSELS, March 8 (Reuters) - The European Parliament is set to approve on Wednesday a report urging the EU to ban golden passport schemes by 2025 and immediately stop the issuance of visas and passports to rich Russians in exchange for investments.  The move follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has triggered global sanctions of unprecedented severity against Moscow, with targets including a number of powerful and wealthy Russians seen as close to President Vladimir Putin.  The golden passport industry, which between 2011 and 2019 generated investments in EU countries of over 20 billion euros ($21.8 billion), is currently almost entirely unregulated in the EU, despite many countries having run these schemes for years.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  EU states such as Malta and Cyprus have made huge profits with their schemes and the European Commission's vice president overseeing financial policy, Valdis Dombrovskis, set up a successful residence investment programme in Latvia when he was prime minister there at the beginning of the last decade.  EU lawmakers say in their report that ending such schemes could have a significant economic impact in some countries. They are therefore proposing the gradual phaseout of golden passport schemes and tight rules for residence arrangements, including much more rigorous checks on applicants.  Companies developing and promoting these programmes, such as Henley & Partners, would face strict requirements. Under the proposal, which is backed by a majority of legislators, revenues generated by these schemes would be taxed to fund the EU budget.  In an amendment to the original proposal prompted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the parliament urges an immediate halt to sales of visa and residence permits to Russians, among the biggest beneficiaries of these schemes.  Once approved, the report will go to the European Commission, which has the power to propose legislation.  EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told lawmakers that the EU executive disagreed with the need for new rules on sales of citizenship because it was already pushing through legal proceedings to shut down existing golden passport schemes in Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria.  But the Commission has said it will assess the need for new laws to tighten golden visa schemes, and also issue shortly a non-binding recommendation on EU member states' issuance of golden passports and residence permits to Russians.  Last month, Britain scrapped golden visas for wealthy investors amid concerns about the inflow of illicit Russian money at a time when Russia was massing forces along the border with Ukraine, a week before launching its invasion. read more  ($1 = 0.9177 euros)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Francesco Guarascio Editing by Mark Heinrich  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

American clothes firms' European businesses were just recovering from two years of pandemic restrictions. But war-related Western sanctions on Moscow, airspace bans and shipping route changes have put new squeezes on East-West supply chains.  "Cargo checks are now one of the biggest disruptions to shippers, making sure they are not breaking sanctions at ports in the EU (European Union) and the UK," said Jane Hali, CEO of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Analysts see particular exposure to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH (PVH.N), Levi Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings (CPRI.N) and Nike , who get roughly 25%-40% of sales from Europe.  Reuters Graphics  "Europe is definitely going to feel the brunt of the economic damage ... which will impact consumer sentiment and consumer wallets," CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring said on the fallout for apparel retailers.  DOWNGRADES  Due to the war, Wedbush analysts have reduced yearly revenue growth estimates by anywhere from 100 to 400 basis points for Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE). and at least eight U.S.-based companies including Skechers USA Inc (SKX.N) and Farfetch Ltd (FTCH.N).  The brokerage also downgraded ratings on PVH and Ralph Lauren's stock to "neutral" from "outperform," while reducing Nike's price target.  Adding to sales pressures, numerous brands have also halted operations in Russia altogether in protest or because of the newly-difficult operating environment. Chinese manufacturers had been sending more goods to Europe by rail across Russia.  Companies with a smaller European presence, such as Carter's Inc (CRI.N), Bath & Body Works Inc and Kate Spade-owner Tapestry Inc (TPR.N), are likely to be more insulated, analysts said, but the challenge remains sector-wide.  "We're afraid it won't just be retailers with high exposure to Europe but most of retail," CFRA's Warring said.

The draft sanctions were adopted by the EU executive on Tuesday morning and will be discussed by EU ambassadors at a meeting starting at 1400 GMT, one source said.

Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a "special operation" to disarm its neighbour and arrest leaders it calls "neo-Nazis". Ukraine and its Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion to conquer a country of 44 million people. read more  EU diplomats have so far approved sanctions proposed by the EU Commission against Russia and Belarus without any changes.

So far EU sanctions have hit hundreds of members of the lower house, the Duma, who voted in favour of Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.  The EU will also expand its ban on EU exports of advanced technology to Russia, mostly supporting the ban on the export of maritime technology, the sources said.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  ORLANDO, Fla., March 7 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have been completely wrong-footed by the surge in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Futures market positioning data show speculators increased their bearish bets on bonds and cut their bullish bets on the greenback, just as both were lifted on a wave of safe-haven inflows.  Hedge funds often risk going against the market consensus to try and maximize returns. But their initial reaction to the conflict unfolding in Europe appears odd, given how likely the safety flight to Treasuries and the dollar was.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for the week through March 1 shows funds' net short position in five-year Treasuries increased by 126,803 contracts to 474,039, and their 10-year net short position rose by more than 80,000 contracts to 365,783.  Both are sizeable moves. Indeed, the cumulative increase in the five-year net short of almost 300,000 contracts in the past fortnight is the most bearish two-week move since these contracts were launched in the late 1980s.  Chart  Funds are now sitting on their largest bet on a higher five-year yield for nearly three and a half years, and their largest bet on a rising 10-year yield since February 2020.  A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.  STAGFLATION  Yet during the week through March 1, which covered the Feb. 24 invasion, U.S. Treasuries rallied across the curve, pushing the five-year yield down by some 30 basis points and the 10-year yield around 25 bps lower.  This was all done on huge volume too. Refinitiv data shows that volume in 10-year Treasury futures in the week of Feb. 21-25 was one of the highest since 2008, and Tradeweb said U.S. government bond average daily volume in February rose 30% on the year to a record $153 billion.  The U.S. economy has relatively little direct exposure to Ukraine or Russia. But the war, and financial and economic sanctions imposed on Moscow, will have a serious impact on Europe especially, and that will drag on global and U.S. growth.  The outlook for U.S. interest rates is also being revised, even though inflation is its highest in 40 years and surging commodity and energy prices could push it even higher. Markets no longer expect a 50-bps rate hike this month and full-year tightening expectations have been lowered to 125 bps from over 150 bps before the invasion.  'STAGFLATION' LOOMS  "Soaring commodity prices and increased risk aversion caused by the Russia-Ukraine war imply a stagflationary shock for the global economy," Barclays economists wrote on Friday, cutting their growth forecasts and raising their inflation outlook.  Chart  All of this continues to show up in the relentless compression of the gap between two- and 10-year U.S. yields. The curve is now within 25 basis points of inverting, a move that usually precedes recession.  Funds have mostly been on the right side of the curve flattening trade this year. But some may think it has run its course and are now trying to position for a reversal, either tactically in the short term, or strategically for the long term.  If funds got it wrong on Treasuries last week, their losses were not covered by their bets on the dollar. The CFTC data show speculators reduced their net long dollar position to $3.84 billion from just over $5 billion.  That is the smallest in six months, yet the dollar has been on a tear and has extended its gains since the war broke out. It rose 1.5% against a basket of major currencies in the week through March 1, and almost 1% on the day of the invasion.  The euro, in particular, is getting hit hard, and Deutsche Bank even said the European Central Bank might have to intervene soon to hold it up. read more  "With safe-haven flows likely to continue for sometime yet and Fed officials eager to press on with their policy normalization plans, 100+ for (the dollar index) is just a matter of time," Westpac FX analysts said on Sunday.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov  LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Recession in Europe and North America may be the inevitable price for defending freedom, resisting aggression and upholding international law in Ukraine.  U.S. and European leaders now face an unpleasant choice as they decide how aggressively to use economic sanctions in response to Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.  The moral imperative is to exert maximum economic pressure rapidly on Russia to end the fighting in Ukraine as quickly as possible and repel Russian forces, which Moscow says are involved in a "special operation" with no plans for occupation.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But the economic imperative is to protect businesses and employment at home, minimise the fallout for lower income households and sustain support for sanctions policies.  In mid-February, top policymakers appeared to have thought they could reconcile these objectives through a carefully controlled sanctions escalation strategy exempting oil and gas trade.  But that plan has broken down as a result of Russia's slow progress on the battlefield and immense diplomatic and public pressure on U.S. and European leaders to maximise sanctions swiftly.  U.S. and European policymakers must choose between imposing maximum pressure on Russia by cutting off oil and gas purchases or a more modest approach that will avert recession.  RECESSION INDICATORS  Even before the invasion, the rapid economic rebound after the pandemic was beginning to decelerate, price increases were accelerating and interest rates were set to rise.  The flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve indicated a heightened probability of a mid-cycle slowdown or end-of-cycle recession in the next year.  Russia's invasion and the sanctions that have followed super-charged these trends, disrupting supply chains, sending energy and food prices soaring and flattening the yield curve further.  The financial crisis in 2008/2009 and the pandemic in 2020/2021 were demand-side shocks that could be offset by lowering interest rates, buying bonds, cutting taxes and boosting unemployment insurance.  But the invasion and sanctions are a supply-side shocks that have cut the global economy’s production capacity so they cannot be offset in the same way.  Boosting demand by more bond buying, cutting taxes or increasing government spending would simply worsen the production-consumption gap and fuel even faster inflation.  The crisis threatens to disrupt global trade in critical raw materials and industrial components ranging from aluminium, nickel and noble gases to car parts, ocean shipping and overland rail freight.  But the biggest and most immediate impact is being felt in petroleum and natural gas, where Russia is one of the world’s top exporters, and grain, where both Russia and Ukraine are major global suppliers.  Energy and food prices, which were already rising before the invasion, are now climbing at the fastest rate for 50 years, at a time when wages are increasing slowly, putting pressure on businesses and household finances.  Lower income households in advanced and developing economies will be hit particularly hard since they spend a much higher share of their income on food and fuel and have fewer options to modify spending patterns.  UNCONTROLLED ESCALATION  Top U.S. and European policymakers seem to have been alert to the risks when threatening to impose unprecedented sanctions in an effort to deter Russia’s invasion.  U.S. and European sanctions were carefully crafted to exclude trade in oil, gas and other energy items from the embargo and to permit energy-related financial transactions.  Planning had assumed that sanctions would be intensified progressively and measures targeting oil and gas flows would be imposed last, if at all.  The controlled escalation strategy was designed to deter and punish Russia while limiting costs for motorists, households and energy-intensive industries in the United States and Europe.  But both sides of the conflict appear to have miscalculated the resolution of the other and underestimated what it would take to bring the conflict to a swift end.  For Russia, that meant misjudging its ability to deliver a rapid victory before sanctions plunged its economy into turmoil.  The United States and Europe, meanwhile, seemed to have assumed incremental sanctions could deter an invasion or bring it to a quick halt before the wider economic fallout was felt.  For the West, the result is now broader sanctions that could last longer than anticipated, increasing economic disruption.  LIMITING DISRUPTION  U.S. and European policymakers seem to have calculated they could take a strong public line on sanctions while letting oil and gas traders to continue purchasing Russian fuel.  But most traders have concluded that the legal and reputational risks are too great and have shunned Russian exports, bringing oil flows to a halt.  Shell felt the impact acutely. It purchased a Russian crude cargo on March 4, only to be met with such a public outcry that on March 8 it apologised and said it would stop spot purchases immediately.  Now political pressure is mounting in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Europe which is far more reliant on Russia, for a complete ban on Russian oil and gas imports.  The possibility that the United States and Europe might initiate an embargo has already sent oil and gas prices surging to levels that will be unaffordable for many households and firms if sustained for an extended period.  In response, Russia has indicated it could cut oil and gas exports if economic warfare continued to escalate, a move that would trigger an immediate full-blown energy crisis.  There is no way the United States and Europe can replace Russian oil and gas exports fully within the next 12 months or absorb the consequences of a further price spike without entering recession.  European economies, with much bigger economic exposure to Russia, are particularly at risk of heading into a downturn.  PHASED SANCTIONS?  U.S. and European policymakers may try to announce that they will progressively reduce oil and gas purchases from Russia according to a fixed timetable over the next two to three years.  Such a phased reduction in Russian oil and gas purchases every six months would be similar to previous progressive sanctions on Iran's oil exports.  Such a move would give more time to secure replacement supplies from others including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Venezuela and the U.S. shale industry over the 12-36 months.  It could also give U.S. and European policymakers negotiating leverage with Russia while reducing, if not eliminating, the immediate upward pressure on energy prices.  Progressive sanctions might even prove more effective if they limit the economic fallout in North America and Europe, and make them more economically and politically sustainable in the medium term.

REUTERS/Jason Lee  LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 8 (Reuters) - China's imports of major commodities appeared largely steady to even somewhat soft in the first two months of the year. But the bland figures mask some dynamic shifts, which are likely to be exacerbated by the ongoing Ukraine crisis.  Official customs data released on Monday showed the world's biggest commodity buyer imported less crude oil, natural gas, coal and iron ore in January and February, but boosted purchases of copper.  China combines data for January and February to account for any distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in early February this year.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Crude oil imports dropped almost 5% in the first two months of 2022 from the same period last year, to about 10.53 million barrels per day (bpd), as independent refiners bought less amid some government curbs on output and exports.  Beijing restricted several energy-intensive and polluting industries over the winter period in a bid to conserve energy and keep air clean during its recent Olympics.  The expectation is that given these restrictions are being relaxed, refiners will step up throughput, seeking to lift exports to take advantage of strong margins on refined fuels.  This may serve to boost China's crude imports in March, which will largely already have been arranged.  However, what happens from April onwards is less clear, given the fallout in commodity markets from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  China hasn't officially condemned Russia's actions - Moscow calls them a "special operation" - but it's likely that the commodity trade between the two countries will be disrupted by Western sanctions against Russia's financial system, and a reluctance of shipping, trading and insurance companies to handle Russian cargoes.  China imported about 757,500 bpd of Russian crude in February, down from 954,000 bpd in January, according to data and analytics company Kpler.  Russia supplies about 8% of China's crude imports, and has the advantage of being geographically close to China's northern ports, which will reduce shipping costs.  China can probably make up for any loss of Russian cargoes by buying more from its traditional suppliers in the Middle East, and from the United States.  However, this will come at a cost, especially since the price of crude has skyrocketed since the Russian invasion, with global benchmark Brent crude futures touching a 14-year high of $139.13 a barrel on Monday, before ending at $123.21.  What Chinese refiners try to do in coming months will matter for crude markets. If they are able, and willing, to continue buying from Russia, it will free up barrels from other exporters to go to refineries in countries that are no longer buying from Russia.  Another potential headache for China is coal imports, which dropped 14% in the first two months of the year to 35.39 million tonnes, from 41.13 million in the same period in 2021.  The decline is largely because of Indonesia's short-lived ban on exports. That slashed volumes from the world's biggest shipper of thermal coal used in power plants in January, with the impact lingering into February.  Indonesia is China's top seaborne supplier of coal, and it's likely that imports from the southeast Asian nation will return to more normal levels in coming months.  However, Russia is China's second-largest seaborne supplier: Kpler data shows imports of around 4 million tonnes per month for much of last year, although February imports dropped to 2.27 million tonnes.  China may find difficulties in arranging cargoes from Russia in coming months. It may struggle in that case to secure sufficient volumes, given Beijing's ongoing informal ban on buying from Australia, which used to be the second-biggest source of imports.  PRICE DISCOMFORT  China's imports of natural gas from pipelines and as liquefied natural gas (LNG) came to 19.86 million tonnes in the January-February period, down 3.8% from the same months in 2021.  This is most likely a reflection of higher spot market prices over winter leading Chinese buyers to hold off purchasing. Mild temperatures also played a role in keeping a lid on demand.  It's likely that China's pipeline purchases from Russia will continue unhindered, and the country isn't a significant buyer of Russian LNG.  However, the sharp increase in the price of oil and of spot LNG will make the fuel more expensive for Chinese buyers, which may also curb appetite for imports in coming months.  The one area of strength in China's commodity imports in the first two months was copper: imports of unwrought copper rose 9.7% to 969,288 tonnes, and those of ores and concentrates gained 10.2% to 4.17 million tonnes.  There may have been some issues surrounding logistics in the boost to imports early this year, as cargoes delayed from the end of 2021 were processed. But it's also worth noting that China's factory activity expanded in January and February, which is positive for copper demand.  Overall, China faces challenges in managing the disruption caused by Russia's actions in Ukraine.  It's certain Beijing won't be happy with the surging prices. It may seek to lower its import bill by releasing strategic reserves of commodities such as crude oil and metals.  It will also seek to maximise domestic output, especially for coal, and accelerate the deployment of renewable energy sources.  The main question is whether China will keep buying from Russia, or whether this becomes too difficult from both a logistical or political point of view.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

Whether it is the move away from an economic system reliant upon hydrocarbons, vanquishing the Covid-19 plague or central banks ending the free-money era, extraordinary shifts are occurring across the planet that will shape markets, corporate finance, politics and economies well beyond the coming year. These are the themes that inform Reuters Breakingviews’ annual book of predictions and prescriptions: “A World in Transition”.  Read PDF  Read online (for mobile)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The extraordinary actions required to drive these epochal trends are being taken now, even if it will be years or even decades before achievements can be meaningfully measured. Inevitable transitions, like the one toward renewable energy, are better embraced than resisted. Investors and entrepreneurs who can adapt to change and its concomitant upheaval will reap the greatest rewards. But they must be prepared to make sacrifices along the way. Without social inclusion, these transformations may lead to violence.  Efforts by governments and companies to reduce carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050 or sooner to limit planetary frying to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will continue to dominate the financial and business landscape in 2022. Switching away from coal, gas and oil is a priority. But every sector, including heavy industries like steel and cement, transportation, agriculture and banking, will soon need to make huge commitments to meet the lofty ambitions of the next generation. Our columnists explore all of these.  At the same time, inflation is less quiescent than in the past couple of decades. Central banks will have to start pulling away the punchbowl, which has broad implications for the cost of capital (it goes up!) and the price of money. Speaking of which, money itself will go through a transformational period as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities try to keep up with the emerging dynamics of crypto and digital currencies.  A third year of the pandemic, with the persistent threat of new, more virulent strains, continues to dramatically accelerate the shift to digital-everything. The winners and losers of this transition will become more evident in 2022. Quasi-monopolies - like Amazon.com in delivery and web-services; Meta (FB.O), the company formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in advertising; and Microsoft (MSFT.O) in workflow – were given extraordinary boosts by state-mandated shutdowns. Governments face a make-or-break year to regulate these multi-trillion-dollar behemoths. Microsoft under Satya Nadella is our pick to manage these headwinds best.  And even as people trickle back to offices, post-pandemic dynamics in communications, training, travel and social interaction are permanently reshaping the workplace and productivity. This has implications for the nature of labour, property, urban planning and beyond. It also poses new challenges to leaders, none of whom were trained at Harvard Business School or INSEAD to run sprawling organisations of employees working individually from home. That’s why we’re predicting predicting high CEO turnover, robot investment bankers and a return to offshore jobs.  The increasingly chilly war between the United States and China will dominate international trade and geopolitics. The kerfuffle over U.S. nuclear-submarine sales to Australia and America’s shambolic retreat from Afghanistan offered glimpses into the fractious nature of the Western alliance. With Xi Jinping set for a third term (if not life) as China’s president, U.S. President Joe Biden has a chance to reach détente of some sort to cooperate on climate change, the pandemic and other priorities. But with Biden’s own party facing a trouncing in November's congressional elections, his hands may be tied. On the plus side, European leadership will have a chance to consolidate as French President Emmanuel Macron likely wins a second term in May, Germany welcomes a new chancellor after 16 years with Angela Merkel at the helm, and Italy chooses its next president.  Success will require extraordinary social inclusion. Governments, companies and taxpayers (especially the richest) have to proactively prepare for the sacrifices that are needed to prevent the earth from scorching, while delivering greater equity, financial inclusion and social justice. Failure to do so will lead to civil unrest or worse. In addition to being terrible for business, that would torpedo more existential goals like limiting global warming, whose deleterious effects will be disproportionately borne by the world’s poor. Here’s hoping the business world and financial markets help guide the way to a fairer, greener and more just society in the year ahead.

The president is set to make remarks from the White House on Tuesday morning at 10:45 a.m. ET, where he will announce "actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine."  As the war in Ukraine rages on, Americans are facing the surge in gas prices, and the Biden administration is facing calls from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to ban imports of Russian oil, and increase domestic energy production.  Zelenskyy, on Monday, called for "boycotts" of Russian oil imports to the U.S. and European countries.  Click here to read more on FOX Business.  Click here to watch on Fox News.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded with U.S. leaders and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country as it continues warring with Russia, setting off a debate about the consequences such a move would have.  "If there were a no-fly zone, and we had to enforce it, that would mean U.S. planes flying concurrently with Russian ones. And you'd run the risk of U.S. planes downing Russians or vice versa," Dan Hoffman, a Fox News contributor and former CIA station chief in Moscow, told Fox News Digital.  A no-fly zone bans aircraft from a specific area and is sometimes used over government buildings for security reasons. The zones have also been imposed during times of conflict to prevent military aircraft from attacking the area.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Hoffman told Fox News Digital that going back to the Cold War, U.S. strategy has dictated "no direct, kinetic engagement with the Soviet Union or with Russia."  "That means our soldiers aren't raising their firearms to go shoot them in the face and vice versa," he said.  Instead, the U.S. has fought proxy wars with Russia since the end of World War II, including currently in Ukraine. A no-fly zone, however, could change that and put U.S. soldiers in direct conflict with Russians.  Zelenskyy held a Zoom call with more than 280 U.S. lawmakers Saturday and pleaded for "urgent" military support and humanitarian aid, including "control of the skies" to combat Russia. He also called on NATO and President Biden last week to impose a no-fly zone over "significant parts" of the country.  "We repeat every day: ‘Close the sky over Ukraine!'" Zelenskyy said in a video posted to Twitter Sunday, accompanied by English subtitles.  But his appeals have hit a brick wall.  NATO and the White House have denied imposing the no-fly zone, while some U.S. leaders have described such a move as coming with disastrous consequences.  "The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. "We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe."  A no-fly zone risks a direct military conflict with Russia. It has the potential of escalating to a third world war, pitting nuclear power countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. against fellow nuclear power Russia.  A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 74% of Americans across the political spectrum support a no-fly zone. But some U.S. leaders say the issue is far more complicated than just prohibiting aircraft over Ukraine.  "If people understand what it means, it means World War III. It means starting World War III," Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Saturday on ABC's "This Week." "It's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by. It's the willingness to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War III."  Democrats have also sounded the alarm on imposing a no-fly zone, including Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.  "I think we need to be clear that we are not going to go to war with Russia, that would be the beginning of WWIII, and it would drag all of Europe into a much broader war," Murphy said on "Fox News Sunday."  Zelenskyy addressed such concerns Monday and said that Russian aircraft bombing his country, including schools, "need to be shot down" to "preserve lives."  "I'm sure that the brave American soldiers who would be shooting it down knowing that it is flying towards the students — I'm sure that they had no doubt in doing so," he told ABC News.  HUMANITARIAN NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE PROPOSED BY FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER  Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, however, have signaled that the no-fly zone option should remain on the table, while retired NATO supreme commander U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove said that a humanitarian no-fly zone could allow for relief trains to get into the country and for the wounded to be cared for.  next Image 1 of 7  prev next Image 2 of 7  prev next Image 3 of 7  prev next Image 4 of 7  prev next Image 5 of 7  prev next Image 6 of 7  prev Image 7 of 7  Hoffman told Fox News Digital that he understands why Zelenskyy is asking for the no-fly zone as it rings the alarm bells that the Ukraine leader is saying "help me or else I'm dead."  Hoffman said that instead, the U.S. could offer assistance in the form of halting Russian oil and gas from being imported and getting Ukraine air-defense systems and anti-tank missiles.

Zelenskyy addressed European leaders Friday and said that if Ukraine is victorious, "this will be the victory for the whole democratic world."  "If we will fall, you will fall, so please don't be silent, do not turn the blind on eye on this," he added.

Fox News asked Psaki Monday why President Biden won't resume new oil and gas leases on federal lands. She responded that the United States is already producing oil "at record numbers" and said "there are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used."  "So, the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate," she added. "I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more."  PSAKI CLAIMS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOT SLOWING DOMESTIC DRILLING  But, industry representatives at the CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by S&P Global Monday said the answer is not as simple as Psaki suggested.  KERRY PUSHES 45% CUT IN CARBON EMISSIONS BY 2030, DODGES QUESTION ON MANCHIN CALL FOR MORE ENERGY PRODUCTION  "That accusation is a complete red herring," American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC) CEO Anne Bradbury told FOX Business. "It's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to continue right away,"  Bradbury also said the Biden administration is "required under the law" to sell oil and gas leases on federal lands.  "The fact is that industry is producing at a higher level on existing leases on federal lands than in the last 20 years and these leases take many years to explore, to develop and produce on," Bradbury added.  "This represents a fundamental misunderstanding as to how this process works," American Petroleum Institute (API) president and CEO Mike Sommers told FOX Business when asked about Psaki's comments. "Once you lease land there is a whole process that you have to go through. First you have to actually discover whether actually there is oil and gas in that land. Second of all, you have to get a permit to actually develop that land."  MANCHIN BLASTS ANTI-FOSSIL FUEL AGENDA AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘BEYOND THE PALE’  Sommers added: "Right now we actually are developing more leases than we have in two decades so the White House certainly doesn't have their facts straight on this."  Energy Workforce and Technology Council CEO Leslie Beyer similarly said "some permits are viable and some are not," as a reason for why many are sitting unused. The federal leasing moratorium also isn't helpful in the current energy environment, she said.  "The moratorium on leasing certainly adds an additional… block to American energy production, so that is the opposite of what we need to be doing right now," she said. "We need to stop the rhetoric that's anti-fossil fuel and we need some clarity just in the regulatory sense that this administration is behind domestic energy production."  Energy industry representatives told FOX Business at CERAWeek Monday that the U.S. is effectively at its capacity for oil and gas production under the current regulatory framework. They said that it would take at least months or even years of investment in extraction and infrastructure to significantly increase output and potentially backfill Europe's energy needs, which are currently filled by Russia.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS  But the administration needs to create the proper regulatory environment for that to happen, they said.  "There's a lack of investment," Beyer said. "We need capital to be able to develop these assets. And certainly while that is the choice of the investors, the rhetoric coming from the administration and everything that is anti-fossil fuel informs those choices."  Many Republicans – and even some Democrats – are pushing the Biden administration to allow for more energy production in the U.S. amid Russia's war with Ukraine. Much of Europe is reliant on Russia for its energy, and they suggest if the U.S. increases its production and export capacity it could help Europe wean itself from Russian energy that's being used to fund the war against Ukraine.  FOX Business' Ralph Giordano and Edward Lawrence contributed to this report.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US IMPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE?  Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 shortly after President Vladimir Putin signed decrees to recognize the independence of separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and described the Ukrainian government as illegitimate.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , who has remained in Ukraine to help defend his homeland, requested more lethal aid from the U.S. last week in a meeting with American lawmakers, and has asked U.S. leaders and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country.  The fighting is getting "a lot" closer to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst said Monday night on "Hannity."

American pundits and liberal journalists have bent over backward to compare Ukrainians getting bombed and killed during Russia’s ongoing attack to the plight of Americans under Republican rule.  Ukraine has been devastated since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion that has resulted in civilian deaths, destruction of cities and over 1.7 million refugees as women and children attempt to flee the war-torn nation. While Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, some pundits have been equating literal war to things such as voting rights and the Jan 6 Capitol riot.  District Media Group President Beverly Hallberg told Fox News Digital that hyperbolic comments simply "shut off dialog we should have on important issues" in the United States.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: ZELENSKYY URGES GLOBAL BOYCOTT OF RUSSIAN PRODUCTS IF WAR CONTINUES  "This is a disservice to the American tradition of productive debate, and it is a disservice to the Ukrainian people who would gladly trade their problem for ours," Hallberg said.  "This is an attempt by the far left to continue with the faulty narrative that our democracy is under attack. They make these comparisons because there are little to no Biden administration victories to highlight, so they are trying to win midterms by keeping Jan. 6 and voting laws in the news," Hallberg added. "But it will be to their own detriment as the American people see very clearly what war is and what it isn’t."  While the American people might realize the difference between war and liberal talking points, many members of the corporate media haven’t gotten the message.  The Atlantic's David Frum appeared on CNN last week and urged President Biden to blame the invasion of Ukraine on Republican ideology.  "These events have given the absolute lie to the false and idiotic idea of America First, America alone, our allies are worthless, having friends is not important," Frum said.  MARIA BARONOVA FEARS ‘WE’RE ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR WAR’ AFTER QUITTING RUSSIAN STATE-RUN MEDIA OVER UKRAINE  Biden’s State of the Union address last Tuesday was the impetus for much of the punditry.  "The end of the speech was about American values just as it was in the beginning when he was talking about Ukraine and Biden wanting to make the point that American unity is one of the things that he was elected to foster is still on the agenda," CNN senior political correspondent Abby Phillip said.    RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES    MSNBC anchors appeared particularly peeved that Biden didn’t tie Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine to what the liberal network considers threats to American democracy.  Joy Reid said Biden had an opportunity to "take a really solid hit at Republicans for having supported Vladimir Putin," but whiffed on the chance.  "He did not mention the January 6 insurrection," Reid added. "If you want to talk about a profound hit to our democracy, there’s nothing more profound than a violent physical attack on the very building he's standing in. That did not make it into the speech, I found that interesting."  "There are critics, including Democrats, some really wanted him to tie the fight for democracy in Ukraine to the voting rights struggles and the challenges with American democracy here at home. He did not do that," correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said.  SHOULD RUSSIAN JOURNALIST WHO QUIT STATE TV AFTER CONDEMNING UKRAINE INVASION FEAR FOR HER LIFE?  The following day on "Morning Joe," Al Sharpton said "we must be consistent" on messaging when rhetorically defending Ukraine.  "You cannot stand up to Putin and have a little Putin-ism in your own backyard," Sharpton said.  MSNBC’s Tiffany Cross had a similar stance when a guest said the war in Ukraine won’t stop the left from pushing their domestic agenda.  "I look at what's happening in Ukraine, and I see, you know, democracy can be a fragile thing, and it feels a bit fragile in America right now," Cross said. "We’re seeing the Republican Party bleed it by 1,000 cuts."  On Sunday, NBC’s Chuck Todd also dinged Biden for failing to make the comparison during his first State of the Union.  "If there was one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad, with the fight for democracy at home," Todd said on "Meet the Press."  Princeton University professor Eddie Glaude, a guest on the show, agreed and declared he was "stunned" at Biden’s missed opportunity.  "I was stunned. I mean it was an easy kind of rhetorical move," Glaude said. "Let’s defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home."  PUTIN IS ‘TRYING BUT FAILING’ TO CONTROL UKRAINE INVASION NARRATIVE BY SHUTTING DOWN NON-STATE MEDIA  Todd then declared it would have been "politically helpful" if Biden could have somehow connected Ukraine to issues in America.  "We have to address the question of what's happening across the country in terms of the assault on voting rights. And we would also have to address the illiberal forces within our country that are driving the challenge to voter rights. So I didn't understand it and I thought it was a mistake," Glaude said.  Last week, Todd was part of a similar conversation with Sharpton on MSNBC.  "I'm curious, you know, to me, this moment of Bloody Sunday and what we're seeing in Europe, there is a connection. It's a fight for freedom, it’s a fight for democracy. And Rev, it’s a statement I thought we would hear from the president on Tuesday that connected the two. He didn't quite do that," Todd told Sharpton on "MTP Daily."  WHOOPI GOLDBERG: 'BONEHEAD' TRUMP WOULD HAVE JUST HANDED UKRAINE TO RUSSIA  Sharpton was in lockstep with Todd, making an apparent play for sprawling Democratic election overhauls that are currently stalled in Congress.  "You cannot fight, and you should, for the right for the people of Ukraine to have a democratic state and make decisions based on voting and then not deal with that same right to be upheld here in America," Sharpton said. "So, as we look for and pray for the people in Ukraine, we need to also deal domestically. And I think that connection is very clear, and we need to make it clear."  Sharpton later added, "We need to underscore that we cannot be global liberators and at home ignore the threat to democracy right here."  Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor feels that journalists are typically eager to do the left’s job for them.  "In this case, that means tying a monstrous invasion to election laws in a free nation. It’s not about facts or even pushing a legitimate argument. It’s about Todd, Sharpton and the rest of the media mob pretending anyone who isn’t a leftist is akin to being a dictator," Gainor told Fox News Digital.  "There’s no ‘fight for democracy at home’ to use Chuck Todd’s words, unless you mean stopping the Biden administration from abusing the First Amendment and pushing censorship," Gainor said, noting that voter ID is supported by the majority of Americans.  "Every demographic group supports that -- just not any of the network news media," he said.  DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said this kind of punditry is "quite misguided" and will further damage the media’s already tarnished reputation.  "America is polarized politically, to be sure, but to compare America's policy struggles to Ukraine's desperate military fight for survival makes no sense at all. The pundits engaging in this kind of extreme rhetoric are certainly trying to exploit a serious international crisis in order to make political smears at home," McCall told Fox News Digital. "The American media has a role to play in providing informed and rational analysis of both international and domestic challenges and this kind of flame throwing only contributes to diminishing public trust in media."  Meanwhile, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams even compared herself to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an appearance on Comedy Central’s "The Daily Show" last week.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We are a stronger nation when we allow people to participate. And if we ever doubted that, the war that Putin is waging against Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said it -- I'm going to paraphrase him probably poorly -- he said this isn't a war on Ukraine. This is a war on democracy in Ukraine. When we allow democracy to be overtaken by those who want to choose who can be heard, and those choices are not based on anything but animus or inconvenience, then that is wrong. My mission is to make certain that everyone can cast a ballot," Abrams said.  Abrams was swiftly mocked for the comparison, and others found issue with host Trevor Noah’s silence.  "Although he’s a comedy host and not a journalist, Noah still should’ve called Abrams out for that analogy because fighting against voter ID laws does not make you the same type of politician as one who has Russian hits squads coming after him because Moscow falsely labels him a Nazi," NewsBusters’ Alex Christy observed.

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said Russian President Vladimir Putin's appetite to reconstitute the former Soviet Union and his advanced age are two significant factors in his invasion of Ukraine.  "Two things about Vladimir Putin: He's got a significant appetite for risk when it comes to Ukraine," the Pennsylvania Republican and Congressional Ukrainian Caucus co-chair told Fox News. "He's identified three capitals of Christianity in the world: Rome, Jerusalem and Kyiv."  "If you want to get inside of his mind, this is almost like a West Bank situation for him," he continued. "This is sacred holy ground to him, and it's the first step in reconstituting the former Soviet Union."  POLISH AMBASSADOR WARNS PUTIN HAS SIGHTS SET BEYOND UKRAINE, CALLS FOR DECADES LONG RUSSIAN SANCTIONS  Fitzpatrick pointed to Putin's advanced age and desire to cement himself in Russian history books as a second driving factor in the Ukraine invasion.  "Vladimir Putin is about to turn 70 years old, and he's up for re-election in 2024," he said. "He has what I call ‘legacy mania.’ He's now focused on how he's going to be written in the history books that future Russian children read."  "It's our job to make sure when the history books are written that Vladimir Putin was, in fact, the dumbest leader they've ever had," Fitzpatrick added.  Fitzpatrick and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee went to the Poland border Friday to get as close to the Russia-Ukraine war as possible. The delegation hoped to see firsthand what is needed to help the Ukrainian people.  As a former FBI agent, Fitzpatrick was sent to Ukraine in 2015 to work out of the U.S. embassy. While there, he helped the country with anti-corruption and economic metrics in its push to become a part of NATO.  CHINA TOUTS 'FRIENDSHIP' WITH RUSSIA: 'MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER'  Fitzpatrick said Ukraine was falling short on those metrics because Putin "constantly sent saboteurs" into the country to erode its institutions, judicial system, police force and energy contracts, among other areas.  Fitzpatrick told Fox News that the U.S. now needs to close all Russian sanction loopholes, including seizing all assets and sanctioning 100% of their banks. He believes Russian exports must face sanctions worldwide, and we must target Russian energy and ban all of their imports into the U.S.  Fitzpatrick also believes the U.S. must sanction "everybody that's anywhere near remotely affiliated" with Putin and his regime, including their family members.  "Sergei Lavrov – Vladimir Putin's right hand – his daughter lives in the United States," Fitzpatrick said. "A lot of these oligarchs funnel money to their children."  UKRAINE MILITARY TURNS VOLUNTEERS AWAY AS 140K UKRAINIANS COME HOME TO RIGHT RUSSIA  "It's got to be all-encompassing," he continued. "There can't be any carve-outs because we're worried about blowback on some of our respective economies because then you're just perpetuating the problem and kicking the can down the road."  "You're going to have a far more costly problem in terms of economics and lives," Fitzpatrick told Fox News.  Fitzpatrick said NATO must also implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a strategy NATO nations have opposed.  A no-fly zone could actively pit NATO forces against the Russians. Secretary Jens Stoltenberg called ruling out such a move a "painful decision" and said NATO has a responsibility not to escalate the conflict by engaging Russian forces directly in Ukraine, either on the ground or in the air.  Ukraine is "a young democracy like we used to be," Fitzpatrick said, "Our democracy is 245 years old, which is very young – just a few generations – yet we are the world's oldest democracy."  "No democracy on this planet has survived more than a few generations, yet so many people take that for granted," he added. "It could disappear tomorrow. We have to guard it vigilantly."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Fitzpatrick said Ukraine is a 30-year-old democracy that won its freedom in 1991. He said young democracies need help from other "freedom-loving" democracies around the world.  "If the message that is sent to the world is that we're going to leave Ukraine to fight on their own, that sends a devastating message to the world," Fitzpatrick told Fox News. "It's unbecoming of American values, and it's unbecoming of Europe and freedom across the globe."  "We have to be there to defend them," he said.

The Ukrainian humanitarian crisis is coming into sharper focus given Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine — and well over a million people are already seeking shelter in neighboring countries, with perhaps several more million refugees still to come.  Given this, Fox News Digital turned to an expert on refugee resettlement issues, James Purcell of Maryland, for perspective and thoughts. "Watching Russia carpet-bomb and kill Ukrainian citizens today, I am reminded of similar experiences involving the USSR [earlier in history]. It's why I believe Russia’s current aggression must be stopped now, or — like before — untold thousands may perish," Purcell said.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Purcell also spoke about the crisis as a father, grandfather and great-grandfather.  "When I pray as a Christian before groups or in the silence of my heart," he said, "I often begin, ‘Father God, who knows no strangers, who calls each of us ‘my child,’ please put us all beneath the shelter of your wing.’"  "I think God expects me, in my own way, to provide a covering wing for my children, my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. And I think God asked me to do the same for all vulnerable people around the world, which is what I tried to do during my career."  He said he's "seen such tragedy in real time."  FAITH LEADER SAYS HUMAN LIFE 'MORE PRECIOUS THAN LAND OR RESOURCES'  "In my lifetime," added Purcell — through times of war and tragedy — "I’ve seen children suffering so badly from famine that their bones nearly disintegrated when I tried to pick them up."  Purcell said, "Our hearts reach out to all those victimized by violence and atrocious behavior by governments such as Russia. I continually look to my role as a father, grandfather and now great-grandfather to experience the type of love that keeps giving — and I continuously pray that I can extend that same love to all those victimized around the world for as long as possible."  ‘Human tragedy’ in Ukraine  Purcell called what's going on in Ukraine "a human tragedy. And governments should not be allowed to cause such violence. A government exists to protect," he added, "not destroy."  "Little happens without committed American leadership to challenge the democratic community to come to the defense of the world’s defenseless," said Purcell.  "To see the bombed-out cities of Ukraine, the bombed-out cars, the smoking buildings, the adults and children running desperately for safety, their lives at grievous risk — this should never be, in our society."  During his career, Purcell directed two prominent humanitarian organizations, the State Department’s Bureau for Refugee Programs (RP), which he began after the fall of Saigon; and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  He told Fox News Digital that earlier on in its history, Russia's "unprovoked and unnecessary attacks left cities, including infrastructure and residences, destroyed and [caused] many deaths and injuries. World outrage was not sustained or specific enough [for] Russian attacks to be stopped then."  "But now that we know of the carpet-bombing strategies used by invading Russian forces in similar crises, it would be unconscionable to fail to realize that similar outcomes are almost surely to happen in Ukraine unless the war is concluded immediately — in a way that respects the dignity of victims under attack," he added.  He said, "Now is the time to apply maximum outside pressure and resolve to bring this conflict to an end before further destruction and deaths result."  Advice for Biden and his cabinet?  Fox News Digital asked Purcell: "If you were to talk to President Joe Biden and his cabinet right now about today's crisis, what would you say or advise?"  "Russia must be sanctioned into weakness and irrelevance by the civilized community."  "The brutal events the world is observing in Ukraine are not new," responded Purcell. "They've happened repeatedly since World War II and usually resulted in gross humanitarian disasters the world should no longer tolerate."  HOW AMERICAN CITIES ARE HELPING THEIR SISTER UKRAINIAN CITIES  He said the "results in Afghanistan and Chechnya, just to mention two of the most prominent disasters, give proof that the same disastrous results and loss of life are inevitable unless the world reacts decisively to prevent them."  This is why, Purcell said, "inspired and courageous responses from the world’s democratic leaders are essential, especially the U.S. Little happens without committed American leadership to challenge the democratic community to come to the defense of the world’s defenseless," he said.  "This is our new ‘Test of Civilization.’"  He said that with the risks right now so great, "the United States and its allies cannot let themselves be paralyzed by Russian aggression because of a fear of repercussions. Russia must be sanctioned into weakness and irrelevance by the civilized community."  Purcell said that "every aspect of modern Russian life must be brought to a grinding halt. Until Russian citizens are brought to the point of revulsion [about] their government's actions in Ukraine, they must feel the pain of unacceptable and diminished Russian governance."  "This includes actions toward normal economic activity, including the purchase of oil, their major income earning activity," he said. "The United States cannot afford to be weak or halting. We must lead the western allies to thwart Russian aggression in a way that, finally, brings authorities to their knees. This is our obligation as the leader of the global humanitarian community."  He also said, "This will happen again unless we vow now that it is no longer tolerable."  A tidal wave of refugees  Fox News Digital asked Purcell, "Are Poland, Hungary and other nations and other neighboring countries to the west of Ukraine adequately equipped to handle the tidal wave of refugees that they're seeing right now?"  "It is not realistic to expect the neighboring countries to solely manage today's flows of refugees from Ukraine, which now include over one million people and an expected population of up to four to five million," he said. "It is time for the international community to step into the breach."  "Now is the time for the world community to step up and help bring this crisis to a humane conclusion."  All countries, he said, that "can supply regional asylum should step up and offer their hospitality. Others who can offer permanent solutions, such as in-country support to internally displaced persons (IDPs) or permanent resettlement abroad, should not shy away from offering help."  "We are all affected, and all should contribute as national capabilities allow," he added. "Now is the time for the world community to step up and help bring this crisis to a humane conclusion."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: UKRAINE YOUTH ORCHESTRA FLEES THE COUNTRY  Jim Purcell’s public affairs career spanned a number of U.S. administrations — from President John F. Kennedy forward. Career highlights include his service as an assistant Secretary of State under George Shultz.  IOM member governments elected Purcell to two consecutive five-year terms as director general in 1988 and 1993. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, IOM maintained over 70 country missions at the end of his tenure. The organization, begun after World War II and focused on Europe, updated its mandate and expanded its membership, geographical scope and capability to help governments facing urgent migration issues and crises.  During the 10 years of Purcell's leadership, the number of member and observer governments affiliated with IOM more than doubled to over 100 and were spread all over the globe.  HUMANITARIAN AID EXPERT SHARES DRAMATIC RESCUE OF UKRAINIAN CHILDREN  Purcell today advises governments and organizations on international migration and humanitarian affairs. He's a widely recognized authority on principled humanitarian responses. His latest book is "We’re in Danger! Who Will Help Us? Refugees and Migrants: A Test of Civilization" (2019).

One of the most unexpected reactions to Vladimir Putin’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine has been the muscular response of a West supposedly in decline.  Previously both Europe and the United States were indifferent in their responses to the successful Russian invasions of Georgia, Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. When Putin went medieval on a stubborn Chechnya in 1999-2000 and nearly leveled its capital of Grozny, the West was again mostly ineffectual.  More recently, the August 2021 American skedaddle from Afghanistan marked the worst humiliation of the U.S. military in 50 years. Fleeing Americans left their sandbagged NATO allies hanging in Kabul. The hasty retreat further emphasized the disunity of the alliance.  END UKRAINE SLAUGHTERE AND STAND UP TO RUSSIA, AMERICANS TELL BIDEN IN NEW POLL  Most NATO members had followed the German lead in refusing to pay their promised investments in military readiness.  So, Putin had some cause to believe that his current invasion of Ukraine would elicit the same anemic response, and that his war would be won in two or three days.  President Biden had successfully fought a congressional effort to sanction the German-Russian Nord Strom 2 pipeline. Biden was sluggish in supplying American Javelin and Stinger weapons to Ukraine when months ago Russia began massing troops on its border.  Biden also cut back American oil and gas drilling by closing down federally controlled leases and productive fields, canceling the pipelines, and discouraging lending agencies to promote fossil fuel production. In default of energy independence, Biden even begged a hostile Putin to pump more oil.  Suddenly NATO and EU members have acted more like the rowers at the battle of Lepanto than loud green pacifists.  Putin concluded that the West in general, and America in particular, were in disarray and decline. He remembered Barack Obama’s 2012 hot-mic, quid-pro-quo deal with the Russians, and his refusal to sell Ukraine offensive weapons. He recalled the anti-American German public opinion polls, and the presence of ex-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder on the Russian Gazprom board of directors.  The 120 days of unchecked American riots in summer 2020 coupled with a U.S. wide-open border, energy curtailment, high inflation, bitter impending midterm elections, and internal discord convinced Putin that America could care less about Ukraine.  But suddenly NATO and EU members have acted more like the rowers at the battle of Lepanto than loud green pacifists. New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lectured his parliament that Germany would now refute its last 20 years of Russian appeasement. Berlin would supposedly develop its own fossil fuel reserves, end energy dependence on Putin’s Russia, rearm, and meet all its prior broken NATO promises.  Suddenly, other NATO members dropped their usual anti-American, ankle-biting boilerplate and outdid each other in promises to rush sophisticated weapons to Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron answered a saber-rattling Putin in near Trumpian style, by reminding the world that NATO too had a deadly nuclear deterrent.  European financial ministers sought to outdo their American treasury counterparts in discovering creative new measures to sanction, and, indeed, bankrupt the Russian war machine.  If Americans still believed that European energy policy is always hostage to extremist Green parties, they should look in the mirror. The American Left is more terrified of its woke green base than German socialists are of their own radical environmentalists.  What caused the Western reawakening – and will it last?  Most obviously, Ukraine fought the Russians in a manner few expected. Its blood-and-guts resistance shamed Ukraine’s European neighbors. They concluded that a non-NATO frontier state had done more to hurt Putin than all the loud communiques from NATO headquarters.  Whereas Western leaders temporize and once talked in platitudes in fear of disrupting the status quo, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy roamed everywhere on the battlefield. The supposedly invincible Putin in contrast looked bloated, confused, petulant and terrified of catching a bug – even as the ubiquitous Zelenskyy spurned the likelihood of catching a bullet.  The West likewise woke up to the reality that its weapons like Javelin and Stingers were superior to those of both China and Russia. The West, not Moscow or Beijing, still controls world financial markets.  Despite its reckless spending and inflation, the West still controls the flow of money and investment. Their sanctions threaten not just to hurt but even to destroy Putin.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Will such Western confidence last?  If Putin finally crushes Ukraine like he did Chechnya, and if China then talks loudly of doing the same to Taiwan, the new woke West will have its uplifting rhetoric tested by a far tougher reality of confronting two angry and preening nuclear states.  If Zelenskyy fails, and gasoline stays at astronomical levels, there will be tremendous pressure on individual Western nations to go rogue and cut a deal with Putin and by extension China.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  So, the verdict is out on the new Churchillian West.  But for now, it was welcome to see Europe and America put an end to their woke apologies, and instead to be encouraged by their proud shared past to face defiantly a dangerous present.

President Biden and congressional Democrats who have championed green energy policies while calling to shift away from domestic oil drilling are facing an uphill battle ahead of the midterm elections, as gas prices continue to climb from near-record highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  During his State of the Union address last week, Biden announced that the U.S. is releasing 30 million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect consumers from the rising prices during the Russia-Ukraine war, but prices have kept rising. The national average has crested over $4 and set an all-time record on Monday.  REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN STOP FUNDING PUTIN'S WAR WITH OIL PURCHASES  Republicans argue that Biden has given Putin leverage by continuing Russian oil purchases while canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and freezing new oil and gas leases on federal lands. They accuse him of funding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine by refusing to sanction Russia’s oil and gas sector.  Some Democrats have blamed the rising prices on gouging and monopolies. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., have blamed the hikes on the "greed" of fossil fuel industries.  "The bottom line is this: The real problem with increased gas prices is gouging and monopolies," Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday. "You’re going to hear a lot more from us on those issues in the near, near future."  Others, like Democratic senators Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Mark Kelly of Arizona, who are facing tough reelection races in their states, have called for temporarily eliminating the federal gas tax. They introduced a bill last month that would scrap the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal tax through the rest of 2022.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that she’s "all for" banning Russian oil imports, and she signaled support for the proposed gas tax holiday, but she is "not for drilling on public lands."  Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., ripped the Democrats pushing the gas tax holiday as "looking for political cover" ahead of the midterms.  "I will note that people promoting this tend to be Democrats who are up for reelection, looking for a way to offset the fact that they have been opposing development of America's traditional fuels," he told Fox News Digital. "Instead, now that we've got a spike in prices, they're looking for political cover, if you will. Another excuse not to do what is politically inconvenient."  Cassidy said it’s "hard to keep a straight face" when Biden says he'll do everything in his power to lower gas prices.  "I once read that the party in power always loses when gas prices are above a certain threshold. They are currently above that threshold," Cassidy said.  "Historically, inflation works against the party in control of Washington," Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told Fox News Digital.  UKRAINE WAR HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, ENERGY EXPERTS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS WARN  Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., who also sits on the committee, touted the American Energy Independence from Russia Act, which "would require the president to unleash America's oil and natural gas production to offset Russian imports," he told Fox News Digital.  "We have seen a 50% increase in energy prices since President Biden took office, and the Russian war in Ukraine will only cause these prices to climb," Bilirakis said. "Instead of flipping the switch and saying yes to American energy, the President is inexplicably doubling down on failed strategies. We need to readjust our entire thinking with the understanding that energy security is national security."  House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who also sits on the committee, agreed.  "President Biden should immediately reverse his devastating policies that are causing gas prices to skyrocket and are giving Putin leverage against the rest of the world and return to the policies that were working under President Trump to create American energy dominance with gas prices below $2 a gallon," Scalise said. "Speaker Pelosi and President Biden’s radical Green New Deal agenda will be a major issue in November’s elections."  "One year of Democrat rule has destroyed American energy independence and driven up gas prices on every family," House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York told Fox News Digital in an email. "In my district, families are paying over a dollar more for a gallon of gas than last year"  "In San Francisco, the price at the pump has reached over $5 per gallon, marking the most expensive average ever for a U.S. city," Stefanik continued. "Make no mistake, American families will not forget Joe Biden destroyed American energy independence and caused prices at the pump to skyrocket."  Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, issued a memo to Republicans Thursday saying Biden’s and the Democratic Party’s "assault" on America’s oil producers has led to a dependence on Russian oil that is helping fund the invasion of Ukraine.  "U.S. purchases, coupled with soaring prices caused by a decrease in the oil supply earned Russia's gas sector record profits last year," Banks wrote. "That cash helped insulate Russia from sanctions and shifted Putin’s calculus towards a full-scale invasion."  Banks’ memo listed several measures Biden could take to boost domestic oil production, including prohibiting the import of Russian oil and gas, ending the pause on new oil and gas leases and permits on U.S. federal lands, and fast-tracking pending liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits.  "More than 99% of cars in the U.S. run on gas or diesel," Banks told Fox News Digital. "I have no doubt gas prices will be one of the biggest issues of the midterm elections. The fact that Joe Biden doubled down on his Green New Deal agenda during his speech on Tuesday goes to show how disassociated Democrats have become from working-class Americans."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  A ban on Russian oil imports has bipartisan support, and Biden has repeatedly said "nothing is off the table" when it comes to his handling of Russia.  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have introduced legislation that would block the U.S. government and U.S. companies from importing any Russian crude oil or petroleum.  Both senators have called for increased domestic production of oil.  Fox News' Houston Keene contributed to this report.

Heading into Tuesday’s events, Ukraine had a total of eight medals – tied with the U.S. and Germany. However, the team was behind Canada, which had 12, and China, which led the way with 25, including seven gold medals. Ukraine is tied with Canada with four gold medals each.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had a reverberating effect on the sports world, and the Paralympic Games were no different. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Games.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Ukrainian Paralympic Committee President Valeriy Sushkevych told reporters last week that it took more than four days for the team to get to Beijing.  "It's a miracle that we're here. … A part of our team was already abroad. A part of our team was in Ukraine. All the necessary equipment was in Ukraine. … We had to unite all those parts," he said, via Reuters.  "It is 25 years I am president of the national paralympic committee of the Ukraine. And never was it so difficult, so heavy to come to the Paralympic Games."  Sushkevych added that it may not be so easy going back home – especially if the fighting continues and escalates.  "Going back home is not simple. I hope the international community takes a real step during the Paralympics to stop this war," he said.  While there’s chaos back home, Ukrainian Paralympic athletes have found some success on the playing field. Read below for a look at the athletes who have racked up medals so far.  Oleksandr Kazik  Oleksandr Kazik won his first medal of the 2022 Paralympics in the biathlon 6-kilometer visually impaired race. He finished in second place in between his Ukrainian teammates Vitaliy Lukyanenko and Dmytro Suiarko. Kazik had won two medals in the 2018 Games – one in 12.5-kilometer visually impaired and the 15-kilometer visually impaired.  Liudmyla Liashenko  Liudmyla Liashenko took home a silver medal in the women’s biathlon 6-kilometer standing event. She finished just behind China’s Yuije Guo and ahead of Yuije’s teammate Zhiqing Zhao. It is Liashenko’s second career medal. She won bronze in the same event in Pyeongchang in 2018.  Vitaliy Lukyanenko  Vitaliy Lukyanenko picked up a gold medal for Ukraine. He won the men’s biathlon 6-kilomoeter visually impaired, finishing just ahead of Kazik and Suiarko in the event.  Lukayanenko is a decorated Ukrainian para-athlete. He came into the Paralympics with six gold medals to his name already dating back to the 2006 Games in Torino.  Taras Rad  Taras Rad came through with a silver medal in the men’s biathlon 6-kilometer sitting. The 22-year-old won his second Paralympic medal with his first coming in the 2018 Paralympics. Rad finished behind China’s Liu Zixu and Liu’s teammate Liu Mengtao.  Oksana Shyshkova  Oksana Shyshkova picked up two gold medals in the first in the first few days of the Games. Shyshkova won in the women’s biathlon 6-kilometer visually impaired and the women’s cross-country skiing 15-kilometer classical, visually impaired.  She beat out Germany’s Linn Kazmaier and Leonie Maria Walter in both categories.  Dmytro Suiarko  Dmytro Suiarko added to Ukraine’s medal count with a bronze in the men’s biathlon 6-kilometer visually impaired. He finished behind teammates Lukyanenko and Kazik.  Grygorii Vovchynskyi  Grygorii Vovchynskyi won a gold medal in the men’s biathlon 6-kilometer standing. Vovchynskyi beat out Germany’s Marco Maier and Canada’s Mark Arendz. It was the first Paralympic gold medal of his career after having won silvers and bronzes in the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics.  American Paralympian shows support for Ukraine  Oksana Masters, who was born in Ukraine and later adopted by an American, competes in the Paralympics for Team USA.  After winning a gold medal on Sunday in the 6-kilometer sitting para biathlon, she wrote on Instagram she felt "so much pride" seeing the Ukrainian flag at the Games.  "It has been difficult to find my passion and desire to compete at these Games amid the war my home country of Ukraine is enduring. I feel selfish, helpless, and guilty for being here," she wrote. "However, I have always been so proud to be Ukrainian, felt so much pride at the sight of the Ukrainian flag, and now more than ever, I am the proudest to say I am Ukrainian. My mom always said my Ukrainian heart made me resilient; it made me a fighter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "As the Winter Paralympic Games begin, I am reminded how sport has always had the power to unite the world. I will be racing for more than just my own goals, more than a spot on the podium. Every pole stroke, I will be racing for the families and kids in Ukraine with disabilities. While the Ukrainian people are fighting for their homes and peace, I want to make every start line and finish line mean something much bigger than a race or a result. I want to help make sure no child is forgotten. I know how it felt to be a child in Ukraine with disabilities where the resource for medical help was slim to non-existent - more now in the midst of a war."

Mila Kunis, born Milena Markovna Kunis, is a proud Ukrainian, originally from Chernivtsi. Her Jewish family fled Ukraine, which at the time was a Soviet republic, when she was only seven years old in 1991, right before its fall.  Her father Mark was a mechanical engineer in Ukraine and her mother Elvira was a physics teacher.  She has previously cited antisemitism in the Soviet Union as one of the reasons her family fled the country. In 2011, the successful actress opened up to the Daily Telegraph about her early childhood.  "My whole family was in the Holocaust. My grandparents passed and not many survived," she said.  MILA KUNIS, A ‘PROUD UKRAINIAN,' AND HUSBAND ASHTON KUTCHER LAUNCH FUNDRAISER FOR PEOPLE OF UKRAINE  "After the Holocaust, in Russia you were not allowed to be religious. So my parents raised me to know I was Jewish. You know who you are inside. When I was in school you would still see antisemitic signs."  "One of my friends who grew up in Russia, she was in second grade. She came home one day crying. Her mother asked why and she said on the back of her seat there was a swastika. This is a country that obviously does not want you," Kunis added.  A LOOK AT UKRAINIAN STARS VOWING TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY  In an interview with Glamour magazine in 2016, Kunis detailed the struggles her parents endured to give herself and her brother Michael, now 46, a new life.  "My parents went through hell and back. They came to America with suitcases and a family of seven and $250, and that’s it," she said in the interview.  "My parents, for years, worked full-time and went to college full-time. They would go to night school to learn English. My mom started working at Thrifty in Culver City as a box lady. That’s what she did until she learned English; then she became a cashier. My dad worked—f--k if I know—seven jobs? He painted a house. He would deliver toilets. He drove a cab, delivered pizzas."  "Whatever he could do, he did. Ultimately, my dad owned cabs, and my mom worked her way up to manager of a Rite-Aid; they bought a car and a condo. But growing up poor, I never missed out on anything. My parents did a beautiful job of not making me feel like I was lesser than any other kids."  MAKSIM CHMERKOVSKY ON LEAVING UKRAINE: ‘I FEEL GUILTY’  Kunis also spoke to the Los Angeles Times in 2008 to share how immigrating to the United States at such a young age affected her.  "It was very communist, and my parents wanted my brother and me to have a future, and so they just dropped everything," Kunis told the outlet.  Kunis said she adjusted "fairly quickly and fairly well."  However, Kunis did admit that she struggled to find ways to fit in during the 2nd grade.  "I cried every day," she revealed. "I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language."  In 2014, the "Black Swan" actress said immigrating to America "was much harder for my 13-year-old brother, it was much harder for my parents."  During the interview with the Star-Ledger, the reporter tried to get Kunis' thoughts on her native country – at the time, Russia had invaded and annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine. But Kunis noted that she was a child when her family had left.  "Just because I lived there until I was 7 doesn’t mean I identify with Ukraine," she said in part. Kunis – as mentioned in a recent social media video – has said she "always considered myself American," however, amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Kunis emphasized she couldn't be "more proud to be a Ukrainian," and is proudly defending the country against Russia's invasion.  Last week, the "That 70s Show" star and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, 44, vowed to match up to $3 million in donations to help provide immediate humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.  In a video that Kutcher shared with his Instagram followers on Thursday, Kunis started off the video saying, "I was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, in 1983. I came to America in 1991. I have always considered myself American, a proud American, I love everything that this country has done for myself and my family."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "But today, I have never been more proud to be a Ukrainian," Kunis concluded.  "And I've never been more proud to be married to a Ukrainian," Kutcher added.  "The events that have unfolded in Ukraine are devastating. There is no place in this world for this kind of unjust attack on humanity," the "Bad Moms" actress added.  The couple then vowed to match $3 million in donations through a relief effort via GoFundMe. It will benefit Flexport.org and Airbnb.org, two organizations that are actively on the ground providing immediate assistance to Ukrainians.  "While we witness the bravery of the people of the country that she was born in we're also witness to the needs of those who have chosen safety. We're raising funds to support a relief effort that will have immediate impact and supply much-needed refugee and humanitarian aid in the area. The principal challenge right now is logistics. We need to get housing, and we need to get supplies and resources into the area," Kutcher said.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed that 406 civilians were killed in Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion began on Feb. 24. And 801 more civilians were injured as of midnight Sunday, the office said, noting that fighting has stymied accurate reporting, and the numbers are actually higher.  The attack has prompted 1.7 million Ukrainians to flee the country.  Fox News' Stephanie Pagones and Melissa Roberto contributed to this report

Pence made the revelation after host Maria Baritromo asked the former vice president if he wants former President Trump to run in 2024 and if he is looking to get back into leadership.  "All of my focus right now is on 2022," Pence responded. "I think we have a historic opportunity to reclaim majorities in the House and Senate, to elect great Republican governors around America and, in 2023, I’m confident the Republican Party will nominate a candidate who will be the next President of the United States of America and at the right time, my family and I will reflect and consider how we might participate in that process."  "But now more than ever with war in Europe and with an administration seemingly intent on weakening our country, driving our nation toward a European-style welfare state, we need strong Republican majorities on Capitol Hill and strong Republican governors and that’s what we are going to work to achieve," he continued.  TRUMP IN ‘BETTER POSITION’ THAN BIDEN FOR 2024 RUN, EX-CLINTON ADVISER SAYS  During the interview Pence also focused on the Biden administration’s energy policies and stressed that the "time has come to sanction all oil and energy exports from Russia."  He argued that the move is necessary given energy is the "lifeblood" of the country's economy."  Pence called on Congress, the Biden administration and nations around the world to implement an international embargo to "bring the kind of pressure that we must bring to bear if we hope to stop this mindless, senseless Russian invasion of Ukraine."  Speaking from Israel on Tuesday, Pence also argued that Vladimir Putin "felt emboldened to redraw Europe by force" and that the Russian president is the only person to blame for the war with Ukraine.  Pence spoke with Bartiromo the day before his policy and advocacy organization launched a $10 million ad campaign, targeting multiple congressional Democrats and pushing for American energy independence amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Pence’s organization, Advancing American Freedom, a 501(c) (4) dedicated to advocating for "Conservative values and policy proposals," launched its first ad buy with an ad titled "Horrific Decision." The ad is set to run in a number of media markets in states across the nation.  The ad calls on viewers to call their member of Congress to tell them to "support America’s security instead of Russia’s terror."  Pence's ad buy comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been pushing legislation to ban oil imports from Russia, and Republicans, especially, have been calling for more domestic oil and gas production in the wake of Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.  GAS PRICES ABOVE $4 PER GALLON AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IMPACTS SUPPLY, DISRUPTING GLOBAL MARKET  The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that in December, the U.S. imported 405,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia or almost 5% of all U.S. imports for the month. That's down from about 800,000 barrels in August.  Democrats have called for a federal gas tax holiday as a possible solution for alleviating prices, while Republicans want expanded domestic oil drilling.  Some critics have accused the Biden administration of funding Russian Putin’s war on Ukraine by cutting down domestic oil production and relying on Russian oil.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki last week said "a wide range of options remain on the table," when asked about potentially reopening the Keystone XL pipeline to minimize energy dependence abroad, but reiterated Biden’s concerns surrounding U.S. energy prices.  On Tuesday morning, The Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the matter, that President Biden has decided to ban Russian oil imports, toughening the toll on Russia’s economy in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine as energy exports have kept a steady influx of money flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.  Biden was set to announce the move as soon as Tuesday, the anonymous source reportedly said. The White House said the president would speak Tuesday morning to announce "actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine."  "In the four years of the Trump-Pence administration, we achieved energy independence for the first time in 70 years," Pence said. "We were a net exporter of energy."  He then pointed to Biden’s moves on energy as soon as he took office, which he pointed out included "killing the Keystone pipeline, taking federal lands off the list for exploration [and] sidelining leases for oil and natural gas."  "Before Ukraine ever happened, we saw rising gasoline prices," Pence said. "So the answer here is number one, stand firm as the United States and have the free world join us in cutting off funds to Russia in their energy exports."

"I hear that President Biden may be headed to Saudi Arabia to ask them personally to pump more oil and for heaven's sakes, let’s offline any further discussion of the Iran nuclear deal for the sake of Israel’s security and frankly in the recognition that now more than ever we should not be dealing with the Ayatollahs in Tehran or Putin in Moscow in lifting sanctions or pressure that we placed on Iran."  A new nuclear agreement with Iran is expected within days, a European diplomat told Fox News on Friday – coming after weeks of renewed talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  The diplomat cautioned, however, that any deal involving Iran, China, Russia, and the U.S. could always unravel. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Iran’s chief negotiator told reporters that a deal would be done within 24-48 hours.  The surge in the price of oil past $130 per barrel on Monday was triggered by the possibility the U.S. might bar crude imports from Russia. Oil prices steadied later in the day and were moderately higher early Tuesday at around the $123 level.  "For heaven’s sake, the time is now for this administration to at least take a time out on their climate change agenda and embrace American strength and American energy," Pence stressed.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reacted to the Russian foreign minister's call for his country and the U.S. to return to the Cold War-like state of "peaceful coexistence" by claiming the Kremlin is making a "mockery" of that concept with its war effort in Ukraine.  Asked about this during a joint news conference with the Estonian prime minister, Blinken was blunt in his response.  PUTIN'S DESIRE TO BRING BACK SOVIET UNION, ADVANCED AGE DRIVING INVASION, UKRAINE CAUCUS CO-CHAIR SAYS  "Peaceful coexistence has two words. The first is ‘peaceful,’" Blinken said. "And Russia’s doing everything in its power to make a mockery of that word through its aggression on Ukraine."  Blinken went on to say that the U.S. would "welcome" peaceful coexistence "in principle" but made clear what Russia needs to do in order to get to that point.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "It needs to start by actually making good on the word peaceful and ending the war, the aggression that it is committing in Ukraine," Blinken said. "It’s pretty straightforward."  UKRAINE MILITARY TURNS VOLUNTEERS AWAY AS 140K UKRAINIANS COME HOME TO RIGHT RUSSIA  Blinken earlier noted that the Russian people are suffering as a result of the war effort, with their currency plummeting in value and major companies ceasing to do business there. He said he wants the people of Russia to know that this is all the fault of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  "President Putin is making Russia a pariah, destroying in the space of a week 30 years of international openness and opportunity," Blinken said, adding that "this is not the Russian people's war" but "President Putin's war to subjugate a sovereign nation."

"If the United States is serious about this, they could come back and help us build Keystone XL," Premier Jason Kenney said at a press conference on Monday. "If President Biden had not vetoed that project, it would be done later this year – 840,000 barrels of democratic energy that could have displaced the 600,000 plus barrels of Russian conflict oil that’s filled with the blood of Ukrainians."  The Obama administration in 2015 pulled support for the Keystone XL pipeline due to climate and public health concerns, but Trump revived the project in 2017 and construction started in 2020. On his first day in office, President Biden issued an executive order revoking the cross-border permit, and TC Energy abandoned the $9 billion project in June 2021.  SHELL TO STOP BUYING RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS, APOLOGIZES FOR RECENT PURCHASE  Though the Keystone XL pipeline had secured most of its funding, a Reuters Fact Check said less than 10% of the pipeline had been built by Jan. 21, 2021, when Biden pulled the plug on its permit. Indigenous groups and activists praised the cancelation of the project, which meant thousands of workers in Canada and the U.S. hired to build the pipeline lost their jobs.  The Biden administration has begun courting Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia for their oil supplies as the Russian forces continue to invade Ukraine.  Yet, Kenney said Saudi Arabia is using oil money to drop barrel bombs on Yemeni civilians, the Iranian regime has dropped bombs on civilians in Syria through the Assad regime and Venezuela is "a regime that kills its political enemies and is one of the worst human rights violators on the face of the Earth." Gas prices topped $4 in the U.S. this week.  Kenney, who will be traveling to Houston, Texas, for the CERAWeek energy conference to advocate for a Russian oil embargo, summarized current U.S. energy policy as "to stop exports from America’s closest friend and ally," meaning Canada, and to "increase exports from one of the worst regimes in the world."  "None of this makes sense, so I will be speaking truth to power in the bluntest terms possible," Kenney said. "If the U.S. administration wanted instead of going cap in hand to the Venezuela, Saudi and Iranian dictatorships to replace Russian conflict oil, we could turn this around, I believe in less than a year."  He estimated the Keystone XL pipeline could be completed by the first quarter of 2023.  HOW MUCH WILL INFLATION AND RECORD GAS PRICES COST THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY IN 2022?  According to the Alberta government’s website, the Keystone XL pipeline would have covered more than 1,200 miles from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska. It would have had the capacity to carry 830,000 barrels per day of crude from western Canadian oil fields to Gulf Coast refineries in the U.S.  In 2021, the U.S. imported an average of 209,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association. Though that’s only roughly 3% of U.S. crude oil imports, Russian imports are crucial to refineries on the West and Gulf coasts.  Image 1 of 2  Asked how high must gas prices get for Biden to consider putting aside his ambitious climate goals to increase domestic oil production, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki asserted on Monday that the U.S. must reduce dependence on "fossil fuels and foreign oil" to avoid ceding to "the whims of a foreign dictator."  "The U.S. produced more oil this past year than in President Trump’s first year. Next year, according to the Department of Energy, we will produce more oil than every — than ever before," Psaki said Monday, arguing that there currently are 9,000 unused approved permits to drill on shore.  "But if we’re looking to the future," Psaki continued. "What we can do to prevent this from being a challenge in future crises -- the best thing we can do is reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil, because that will help us have a reliable source of energy so that we’re not worried about gas prices going up because of the whims of a foreign dictator.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. crude oil production reached almost 11.8 million barrels per day in November and topped 12 million barrels per day by February.  In reference to Iran, Psaki pointed out that Trump abandoned the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2018.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  "I don’t think anybody is advocating for Iran to continue acquiring a nuclear weapon, perhaps except for the former president who pulled us out of the deal," she said.  Addressing soaring gas prices, Kenney also announced Monday that Alberta would stop the collection of the provincial fuel tax. He said it was to offer relief from Canadian Minister Justice Trudeau and the Ottawa-based federal government’s carbon tax rate on gasoline set to increase again on April 1.  "Between the uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, plus skyrocketing inflation spurred on by Justin Trudeau’s reckless deficit spending – and on top of all that, his plan for a carbon tax hike on April 1st is costing families more and more to get their kids to school and to drive," he said.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, slammed President Biden on "Fox & Friends" Tuesday for being "afraid" to stand up to Democrats on increasing U.S. energy production as gas prices skyrocket amid the Russia-Ukraine war.  GAS PRICES FUELING COMING DEMOCRATIC BLOODBATH IN MIDTERMS, REPUBLICANS SAY  REP. JIM JORDAN: I sat in a hearing a few months ago where Ro Khanna, a Democrat member from California -- the state that's now got a $7 gas. He had the oil and gas executives there in front of them, and he badgered every one of them, asking them one simple question: Will you pledge to decrease production this year? I mean, the Democrats want $7 gas. So that is the biggest problem.  …  What that means to middle class families, how that hurts our economy, how that drives up the price of everything because you got – it takes fuel to move goods around the country. So it's complete craziness, but that's where the left is today. And unfortunately, they have complete control of the Democrat Party and Joe Biden, I think, is afraid to stand up to them. That's why he's talking to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and Iran, for goodness sake.  WATCH THE FULL ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ INTERVIEW BELOW:

"We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel – despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking – was not the right one and we are sorry," Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement.  The company said it will also shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia.  Shell announced plans in late February to exit its relationship with Russian energy company Gazprom and related entities, and that it would end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.  "These societal challenges highlight the dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies across Europe," said van Beurden. "But ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made during the war in Ukraine. We will continue to work with them to help manage the potential impacts on the security of energy supplies, particularly in Europe.

"I didn't wish anything bad on anyone, I just showed [what] my position [was]. As an athlete, I will always fight for victory and stand for peace. Only [for that] and everything."  While Kuliak brushed off the "Z" symbol like it was no big deal, the pained white "Z" first appeared on tanks and other military vehicles as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. The symbol has been said to identify the vehicles as friendlies for Russian forces.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Kuliak couldn’t propel his way out of criticism over his "position."  The 20-year-old from Kaluga, Russia, finished in third place in the parallel bars at the event and joined Ukrainian Illia Kovtun and Kazakh Milad Karimi on the podium.

EXCLUSIVE – Maria Baronova resigned as editor-in-chief of Russia Today, a state-run media operation also known as RT, last week after condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. She’s well aware that anyone who speaks out against the Kremlin could be in danger – but personal safety is the least of Baronova’s concerns.  "The problem is, I know these people very well. They never send threats, they just kill, so there is kind of [a] weird silence around me, but I really think we’re on the brink of a nuclear war right now. I’m not exaggerating," Baronova told Fox News Digital from Moscow, via a WhatsApp call.  "I have a son, I can’t leave because his father won’t allow me to leave with him, and so I just prefer to stay in Moscow … It seems like we’re either in North Korea or we are going to be killed by a thermonuclear mushroom," she said. "I wouldn’t quit, and I wouldn’t lose my salary and job if I was sure that we are going to be alive for many years, but I really don’t know what is going to happen to all of us next."  SHOULD RUSSIAN JOURNALIST WHO QUIT STATE TV AFTER CONDEMNING UKRAINE INVASION FEAR FOR HER LIFE?  While many around the globe are gravely concerned Putin would resort to nuclear weapons, Baronova is worried his behavior will make Russia the target of a catastrophic attack.  "I suspect the Western world will use it," Baronova said. "This is a very dangerous situation."  The blunt Baronova agreed to talk to Fox News Digital until her son’s food was ready. She explained that the last straw before quitting RT wasn’t any sort of on-air propaganda, but rather an Instagram message from her colleague who wrote, "If you are now ashamed of being Russian, don’t worry, you are not Russian," as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine intensified.  "I was really disturbed by that tone and level of support," Baronova said, noting that she publicly responded to her now-former coworker’s message.  "If I chose to be with Russia, this does not mean that I should walk in a totalitarian system, be silent or, for example, rejoice that the regime, which I do not want for my country, is being exported somewhere else," Baronova wrote. "And this regime will finally turn our life into one endless hell. What's there. Already turned."  Baronova then stepped down from the state-run network.  "That was the moment I decided, ‘OK, that’s it,’" she said.  PUTIN IS ‘TRYING BUT FAILING’ TO CONTROL UKRAINE INVASION NARRATIVE BY SHUTTING DOWN NON-STATE MEDIA  Baronova said she hasn’t garnered much support from fellow Russians since leaving RT and is seen as an opposition activist. But this isn’t the first time Baronova found herself in the public eye for opposing Putin’s regime.  She was featured in a 2012 New York Times piece headlined, "A Face of the Russian Protest Movement," that detailed the time she was charged with inciting a riot while protesting Putin winning a third term. In 2014, Rolling Stone said she was "for a short while, one of the most visible protesters in Moscow," in a piece that detailed anti-Putin activism led by the punk band Pussy Riot.  Her life was upended after the arrest and she eventually went to work for Dozhd, Russia’s top independent TV channel which is also known as TV Rain and famously critical of Putin.  Baronova, who was by then a single mother, jumped ship to RT in 2019, irking fellow Putin oppositionists who felt she was abandoning the movement by joining state-run media.  "People felt betrayed when I decided to join RT," she said. "But I decided on purpose in order to have a reasonable conversation with people who are in power right now in Russia."  Last week, Russian authorities accused TV Rain of peddling "false information regarding the actions of Russian military personnel as part of a special operation" in Ukrainec, and Baronova’s prior network was promptly forced off the air as Putin purged non-state media.  ZELENSKYY URGES GLOBAL BOYCOTT OF RUSSIAN PRODUCTS IF WAR CONTINUES: LIVE  Baronova's two previous employers have suffered different fates over the past few days, as RT remains on air and has echoed Putin’s message throughout the Ukraine invasion.  Baronova, who was the managing editor of RT’s Russian language unit, said she wanted to bring positivity to the state-run outlet and much of her responsibilities focused on covering problems with social institutions. Baronova said she also spent much of her time at RT working on a fundraiser for mothers of children with cerebral palsy, and she was largely kept out of conversations regarding which Kremlin talking points would be spouted by the outlet despite her editor-in-chief title.  Roughly three years after joining the state-run news organization with hopes of forcing change, the activist-turned-journalist had seen enough after Putin’s ruthless attack on Ukraine that was supported by many of her now-former RT colleagues.  "I have nothing else to talk about with them," she said. "Our own government is bombing our relatives, our friends."  Baronova feels many Russians are "brainwashed" and some even buy Putin’s claim that the attack was needed to help "denazify" Ukraine, which the Kremlin has insisted was the true aggressor. Putin has claimed he wants to purge Ukraine of fascism; such messages, experts have told Fox News Digital, are appealing in Russia since loathing for the defeated Nazi Germany regime runs deep.  WAPO OP-ED SLAMS MANCHIN FOR COMMENTS ON NO-FLY ZONE: 'HE WON'T FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES'  "I try to talk with people on the streets… they even had arguments like, ‘We are fighting with Hitler,’ but look, I’ve got some news. Hitler died 80 years ago," she said. "It seems like they’re really brainwashed."  Putin has cracked down on non-state news since the invasion of Ukraine began, with social media platforms and independent news operations forced to shut down for refusing to parrot propaganda. Some locals don’t mind that Putin has silenced non-state media and a Moscow taxi driver even told Baronova the now-shuttered TV Rain was filled with "traitors" who opposed the Kremlin.  "A lot of people have these kind of sentiments," she said.  Despite Putin’s attempt to control messaging related to the Ukraine invasion, Baronova is baffled that people still buy into his narrative when accurate information can be found by anyone eager to find it.  "We have internet like everybody else in this world, and you can’t hide information from people in the era of the internet, so I don’t understand how they can be brainwashed. How can they be saying that Russia is fighting with Hitler collaborators in Ukraine when Hitler died 80 years ago? But they really have these kinds of conversations," Baronova said, noting that some Russians have begun to open their eyes because of sanctions and American companies pulling out of the nation.  "People were in favor on [the] first day of invasion. Now they are less convinced and much more skeptical because they understand now that they are going to lose their jobs, they are going to lose their cars, their iPhones, their everything," she said. "So, let’s see what that are going to say in a month ... The whole world is in a bad position."  Painting a bleak picture, Baronova said it feels like 1945, the final year of World War II before quickly correcting herself.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Probably more like 1939," she said, referring to the year that World War II began. "It is really pointless to predict anything … We are watching a lie on my TV."  Suddenly, Baronova had to go, as her son’s meal was ready – she told him to please put down his phone and eat. Before hanging up, she had one final message for Americans.  "Russians love their children, too," she said. "Stay safe. Everybody, stay safe."  Fox News’ David Rutz contributed to this report.

Of the Republicans surveyed in the Quinnipiac University Poll, 68% said they would stay and fight compared to 40% of Democrats. Among Democrats, 52% said they would flee the country, compared to 25% of Republicans.  While the hypothetical question was polarizing between parties, the majority of Americans (55%) would still stay and fight if they were in the same position as the Ukrainians are now. Only 38% of those surveyed said they would leave the country.

According to the poll, 60% of Americans also believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is mentally unstable and willing to use nuclear weapons against NATO countries.  When asked if Putin's actions against Ukraine were comparable to Adolph Hitler's actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of World War II, half of Americans surveyed agreed.

"Russians are largely in the dark about and unable to halt the destruction being wrought by Putin, say Americans who see the Russian leader as mentally unstable. And half of Americans liken Putin to modern history's darkest villain, Adolf Hitler," added Malloy.  Nearly half of Americans (49%) also say the attack on Ukraine has contributed to them feeling anxious, according to the poll.

Neal Crabtree was laid off from his position working on the Keystone XL pipeline. He’s now warning that the U.S. is in for "deep trouble" if President Biden’s energy policies continue to inhibit pipeline construction.  President Biden’s move to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office has come under increasing scrutiny amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has sent gas prices soaring across the country.  Jen Psaki doubled down Monday, suggesting that the pipeline wouldn’t have affected the current surge in prices.  PUTIN'S UKRAINE WAR SHOWS NEED FOR US-EUROPE ‘OPERATION ENERGY INDEPENDENCE’  Crabtree, however, said the liberal policies are causing the problem.  "As long as Biden is using this policy of any-way-but-an-American-way, we’re in for some deep trouble," he said.  On "Fox & Friends First" Tuesday, Crabtree said that returning to domestic energy production would have an immediate impact on the record-high gas prices.  "The thing about the Keystone is the workforce is ready to go. We can build this thing," he told host Carley Shimkus.  "We can have this thing up and going in about eight months."  Republican lawmakers have repeatedly called for a return to the Trump-era policies that allowed the U.S. to become energy independent as recently as 2019.  Senator Josh Hawley called for a "full throttle" return to domestic energy production.  "While Biden ramped down America’s energy production, destroying blue-collar jobs and livelihoods along the way, Putin ramped up," Hawley wrote in a Fox News op-ed.  Crabtree believes it would be ‘no problem’ to make up the average 670,000 barrels of imported Russian oil each day if President Biden were to allow construction to resume.

MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd suggested that voters are wrong to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if President Trump was still in office.  With Russia launching its attacks on Ukraine, many of President Biden's critics have alleged that such an invasion would not have occurred under the Trump presidency, pointing to the aggression Putin took under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama with the 2008 invasion of Georgia and the 2014 annexation of Crimea while making no similar moves during the past administration.  The subject emerged during a panel discussion on Friday's installment of "MTP: Daily."  "There was this focus group - and it’s qualitative, not quantitative - where swing voters, Trump-Biden voters seem to buy the idea that Putin wouldn’t have done this in Trump was president," Todd said to Democratic strategist and former DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa. "How does the Democratic Party answer for that?  MSNBC'S CHUCK TODD SHOCKED BY BAD ECONOMIC POLLING, CLAIMS AMERICANS ‘DON’T FEEL FIRST WORLD ENOUGH'  Todd then went out of his way to vocally reject the notion voters believe about the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis.  "I don’t buy that," the MSNBC host stressed."I don’t think that matches logic, but voters do. That’s a perception issue."  Hinojosa first responded by calling the image of Trump being president during the current international crisis as "scary."  She went on to say that Democrats have to run on with a message that they are looking after "American interests" and point to Biden's "leadership" on the global stage.  Earlier in the week, Todd went to bat for the Biden administration over how voters view the economy.  The liberal host went off on polling that showed a majority of people think the economy is in either a recession or depression, declaring it was "just not true," and blaming the "right-wing echo chamber" for causing those views. He also accused Americans of not feeling "first world enough."  MSNBC'S CHUCK TODD SHOCKED BY BIDEN'S POLLING HITTING 'NEW BOTTOM': ‘MY GOODNESS!’  "Fifty-one percent believe the economy is in a recession or depression. I mean, look, it’s just not true," Todd exclaimed after NPR reporter Ayesha Rascoe argued that Biden wasn't able, as president, to actually do anything about the rising inflation rates plaguing the country, citing a USA Today-Suffolk University poll.  "This economy is frustrating. This economy with COVID has been — I’ve got money and I can’t find something. But my god, there’s jobs. There’s good jobs," he added. "Is this the right-wing echo chamber is better than the Democratic echo chamber? Or is there something else missing here?"  Jen Palmieri, a former White House communications director under the Obama administration, agreed with Todd and claimed that Democrats didn't just repeat what they were told to say, unlike Republicans. Republican strategist Matt Gorman pushed back, arguing that what people were feeling was broader than just the economic measurements, citing staff shortages and supply shortages.

A Florida man was crushed to death by a bulldozer last week while he was using a porta-potty, according to authorities.  Aaron Henderson, 40, was killed Friday evening while he was working as a traffic control contractor at the North Central Landfill in Polk County, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said.  Henderson had been working as a "spotter" at the site, providing traffic control to incoming and outgoing dump trucks from the ground as they dumped trash in the landfill, FOX 13 Tampa Bay reported.

When the bulldozer reached level ground, the driver turned the motorized machine, heard a loud crumble, and noticed he went over the porta-potty, which he was unaware was near the staging area, FOX 13 reported.  "He immediately exited the bulldozer and ran towards the porta-potty to see if anyone was inside of it," a sheriff’s office spokesperson told St. Petersburg's WTSP-TV. "At that time, he observed Henderson unresponsive inside the porta-potty."

The video surfaced Monday, the same day when Russian police detained approximately 4,500 anti-war protesters, according to The Telegraph.  "We were all deceived, all deceived. They were sent there as cannon fodder," one woman screamed at Sergey Tsivilev, governor of the Kuzbass region in Siberia. "They are young. They were unprepared."

As The Telegraph notes, it remains unclear whether the shouting women's sons had been killed in Ukraine.

Jesse Watters said Monday that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was a proxy war between the West and Russia.  Watters said he believes Biden's foreign policy decisions, including "dangling NATO membership over Ukraine's head" enticed Russian President Vladimir Putin to push forward on his expansionist ambitions.  "This move directly taunted Putin. He was furious and accelerated his mobilization against his neighbor. Did we have a plan for Ukraine? What did we expect?" the "Jesse Watters Primetime" host said.

"Hillary Clinton hinted at the plan last week," Watters said. "Turn Ukraine into a killing field to bleed Russia dry."  On MSNBC last week, Clinton said "Remember, the Russians invaded Afghanistan back in 1980 … it didn't end well for the Russians.

"So what we're watching unfold on the ground in Ukraine, a horrible ground war that moves to a Western funded insurgency. That after many, many years, sends Russia packing is a model. We're watching a proxy war," Watters concluded.  "I'm afraid we could be hurtling ourselves into a deadly war that we can't stop," Watters said.

One image shared by the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shows a father desperately rushing his 18-month-old baby to a hospital after a shelling barrage.

Fox News host Mark Levin warned Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue his apparent quest to destroy former Soviet states if President Biden and the West don't take decisive and constructive actions to back up the Zelenskyy administration's efforts to defend Ukraine.  The "Life, Liberty & Levin" host said Biden's behavior is the exact opposite of that of his former boss, Ronald Reagan, who along with United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher successfully realized the collapse of the Soviet Union.  "Reagan crushed the Soviet Union economically and did in fact supply enormous amount of weapons all over the world to the enemies of the Soviet Union, whether it was in Angola, in Africa, whether it was in the Middle East, whether it was in Afghanistan," he said.  "Wherever the Soviets were, Reagan would put up opposition to them -- And it's a funny thing it didn't create World War III."  PISCOPO: ‘GANGSTER’ PUTIN 'TOOK OVER WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD' WITH NO ONE IN WHITE HOUSE  Levin predicted further aggressive action worldwide by Putin if he is able to kill President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or take over the former Soviet republic.  "Why is it that the Ukrainians have to have their cities destroyed? Why is it that we're all sitting and just waiting for the Russians to go in and take out Kiev and kill their president? Why is that? I've never seen anything like this in my life," he said.  Levin said Zelenskyy urgently wants the U.S. to supply him with MiG-29's or F-16s, despite the latter's aging technology.  He said the Pentagon can easily supply a few to Kiev, and that that can be done without engaging in a "no-fly-zone."  "Why do people think that this coward Putin, who's hiding out in some bunker, is going to use nuclear weapons? I don't get that," he added.  "If he was going to use nuclear weapons, he doesn't need us to provoke them. He can use nuclear weapons tomorrow. He can use whatever he wants to. But he hasn't, and he's not going to -- And neither is that Lavrov, that long in the tooth crackpot foreign secretary."  Levin suggested Putin will not start nuclear war despite his apparent threats of escalation, because the Kremlin "doesn't want to die" when the West likely responds.

In President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address to the nation last Thursday, following the Russian land, sea, and air invasion of Ukraine, he admitted that no one thought sanctions would stop President Vladimir Putin from carrying out the largest attack against a European state since World War II.  Let’s set aside that Biden admitted his own strategy in anticipation of the invasion was flawed – even though his administration considered it a certainty. If he didn’t expect sanctions to stop Putin, what then did he think would deter the crisis in Ukraine from erupting?  Apparently, the Biden administration bet the Chinese Communist Party would help out.  CHINA REMAINS ‘ALL IN FOR PUTIN,’ CHINESE-RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICIES ARE ‘HIGHLY COORDINATED,’ GORDON CHANG SAYS  The New York Times last Friday, reported, "Over three months, senior Biden administration officials held half a dozen urgent meetings with top Chinese officials in which the Americans presented intelligence showing Russia’s troop buildup around Ukraine and beseeched the Chinese to tell Russia not to invade, according to U.S. officials."  After one of the talks in December, the Biden administration learned that instead of Communist China’s officials persuading Putin to pull back, "Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord – and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions."  Reading between the lines, this sudden release of information by the Biden administration appears to spin the message that President Biden tried to stop Putin’s invasion months ago, and he blames the Chinese Communist Party for not following his request.  As former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and I detailed in "Trump vs China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat," the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for a lengthy list of violent, oppressive, and deceitful transgressions – not least of which includes the genocide in Xinjiang, the coverup of the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the elimination of freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong.  CHINA TOUTS ‘FRIENDSHIP’ WITH RUSSIA: ‘MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER’  If you study the actions of the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, it is clear their officials’ response to the U.S. request should be expected. It’s perfectly in accordance with the Party’s pursuit to make China the global superpower by 2049.  Why on Earth would the president of the United States of America rely on an adversary to diffuse a dangerous escalation by a foreign dictator? Further, while the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin do not have a formal alliance, they are strategic partners (meaning that when it benefits General Secretary Xi Jinping and President Putin, they work together).  REPS. KIM, SLOTKIN INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO INVESTIGATE CHINA SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE  Before this year, Xi and Putin met 37 times. Just last month, they met again and issued a more than 5,000-word joint statement which articulated a "redistribution of power in the world" and criticized the United States by name six times. Xi affectionately refers to Putin as his "best friend."  For evidence of their transactional comradery, look no further than the photos of Xi and Putin making pancakes together in 2018, taking a boat cruise along the Neva River in 2019, or the cake and ice cream that Putin gave Xi on his 66th birthday.  Did the administration honestly believe that the Chinese Communist Party didn’t know what Russia had planned for Ukraine? Did the White House think Communist China would really side with the United States and stop Putin? What did President Biden honestly think these two "best friends" discussed when Putin went to China for the Genocide Olympics last month?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  It was never in Communist China’s interest to stop Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, the Chinese Communist Party benefits from this aggression in the long term. First, the Party gets to learn the U.S. playbook for dealing with conflict between foreign countries (adding to what China learned about U.S. military tactics during the Gulf War in real-time). Sharing our intelligence with Communist China also could expose U.S. sources and methods of intelligence gathering in Russia.  Now, regarding the possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the western response to the invasion of Ukraine may have given Xi cause for concern. However, the attack on Ukraine isn’t necessarily a perfect analogue. The U.S. economic relationship is much different with Russia than it is with China. We’ve repeatedly seen American companies fail to condemn the Chinese Communist Party for its genocide in Xinjiang. Instead, they pressure U.S. politicians to kill legislation that would hold the Party accountable.  Furthermore, while Washington and media are watching Russia, the Chinese Communist Party is once again able to return to the playbook of Deng Xiaoping – hiding its capabilities and biding its time.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  After all, Congress remains gridlocked on enacting policies that strengthen America and counter the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions (only three of 238 bills targeting China passed in Congress as of December 2021), and President Biden has done a 180 degree turn from President Trump’s leadership in making this a priority.  Amid these revelations, and in the aftermath of the weak State of the Union address, it is evident America needs a leader who will boldly and courageously stand up to the most dangerous threats our country currently faces. Let’s hope that President Biden starts living in reality – sooner rather than later.

The gut-wrenching scenes from Ukraine have moved millions around the world to denounce the Russian invasion and support Ukrainian independence.  For some, however, it is a literal call to duty. Thousands of former soldiers have traveled to Ukraine to defend its people. The numbers have clearly unnerved the Russians who have launched a global campaign to warn volunteers that they will be treated as mercenaries, not legitimate prisoners of war if captured.  ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, ‘BOYCOTTS’ OF RUSSIAN OIL  Among the large number of such volunteers drawn to Ukraine’s defense are many Americans. They are in a modern version of the Lincoln Brigade that fought against fascism in Spain before World War II. The similarities to the Spanish Civil War are striking with the fascists controlling the skies, fielding advanced weaponry, and engaging in war crimes. Back then, Russia supported the Republican forces against fascism.  Now, however, Russia is declaring that foreign volunteers are not considered covered "combatants" under the Geneva Conventions. That is not true.  Russian embassies are putting out statements telling men not to join the fight at the risk of being classified "mercenaries." The Russians are warning that the "best case scenario" is that foreign volunteers will be tried and punished as criminals, including the risk of executions.  Of course, Russia has little credibility on any interpretation of international law today. There is growing evidence of possible war crimes by Russia, including attacking civilian areas with indiscriminate weapons and using prohibited weapons. Moreover, Russia is using mercenaries like the infamous Wagner group.  Putting aside the hypocrisy, the Russian government is legally wrong. Under the Geneva Conventions, "the best case scenario" is not "detention and prosecution." The Ukrainian president and government has officially called on international volunteers to join the Ukrainian military. They are a part of the Ukrainian defense forces and given Ukrainian training, uniforms, and insignia. The Russian position is akin to saying that the French Foreign Legion would be treated as mercenaries because it includes non-French volunteers. The Legion famously opens its ranks to "recruits from all over the world."  Likewise, the estimated 16,000 foreign fighters are being organized under the "Ukrainian Foreign Legion" and requires a commitment of a year or longer of service.  The Geneva Conventions  While there are areas of ambiguity over private contractors and other participants in conflicts, the current definitions of covered combatants clearly and unambiguously reject the Russian position.  Article 4(A)(1) includes "Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps performing part of such armed forces." Thus, both militias and volunteer corps are included.  Article 4(A)(2) also makes clear that "Militias and members of other volunteer corps … belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory" enjoy combatant status and protections.  Under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols, there is a division drawn between combatants and civilians. The later term can include unlawful combatants, spies, and mercenaries.  Moreover, Article 45 addressed the "Protection of persons who have taken part in hostilities" and affirms that every combatant who is captured shall be presumed to be a prisoner of war. Accordingly, if a foreign fighter is captured "he shall continue to have such status and, therefore, to be protected by the Third Convention and this Protocol until such time as his status has been determined by a competent tribunal."  Conversely, mercenaries under Protocol I are defined as "foreign combatants recruited to fight in one specific conflict and motivated by the desire for private gain in an amount in excess of the payment to the armed forces of the recruiting state." That is not the case in Ukraine.  History and Hypocrisy  Ironically, the Russians have long embraced such international volunteers in combat operations. One of the largest such efforts was the Soviet Volunteer Group that went, with government support, to China to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War between 1937 and 1941. These soldiers wore civilian clothes and traveled to China to become part of their military. That included hundreds of pilots and planes.  The Russians also were foreign combatants in the Spanish Civil War. They were considered particularly key to the defense of Madrid against the fascists, including German forces. That included a force of T-26 tanks under the famed Captain Paul "Greize" Arman and Brigadier Dmitriy "Pablo" Pavlov. It also included dozens of Soviet I-15 fighters Tupolev ANT-40 bombers. Under the current interpretation of Russia, all of these men (called Soviet heroes) would now be treated as criminal mercenaries.  Future Enforcement Requires Immediate Clarity  If Russia carries through on its interpretation of the Geneva Conventions to exclude foreign members of the Ukrainian defense force, it would be in flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions.  One could say that this hardly matters when the Russians are shattering international legal principles and committing atrocities in the invasion. However, the violation of the Geneva Conventions exposes military commanders to possible international charges and sanctions. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (or "the Tokyo Trial") involved the prosecution of officials responsible for the abuse of POWs.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Article 86(2) of Protocol I was written in light of the World War II cases. It imposes criminal liability on the commander if he knew or should have known that a subordinate was going to commit breaches of the conventions.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The world legal community must speak with one voice in rejecting the interpretation put forward by Russia on the Geneva Conventions so there is no question about the knowledge of Russian commanders in committing such violations. When this war ends, there will hopefully be an accounting for those responsible. However, we must make that clear and unambiguous record now if we are going to later vindicate the rights of the victims of this invasion.

Over the last two decades, American innovations led to unprecedented breakthroughs across all energy sectors, including renewables and traditional forms of energy. And for a brief recent period of time these gains helped to secure a monumental national achievement: U.S. energy independence.  Sadly, in an even briefer period of time we quickly lost it due to policy decisions based on leftist Green New Deal political agendas embraced early on by the Biden administration.  As a result, Americans are paying skyrocketing costs for energy, food and other daily staples. Domestic prices will be further exacerbated by the new security threats and global instability arising from Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  END UKRAINE SLAUGHTER AND STAND UP TO RUSSIA, AMERICANS TELL BIDEN IN NEW POLL  All told, it is now abundantly clear the U.S. is in immediate need of a systemic reset of its energy policies.  Yet, it was evident from President Biden’s State of the Union address that his administration is set to double down on the same misguided policies that led to the loss of our energy independence, naively sticking to an almost exclusive focus on renewable energies at the expense of America’s vast arsenal of more conventional energy assets. Even more bizarre was former Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent tone-deaf commentary over the potential impact of battlefield emissions and concerns over whether war in Ukraine might distract Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attention from fighting climate change.  Do today’s liberal political leaders in Washington really expect our global allies, adversaries and competitors to take the U.S. seriously with such nonsense?  The world is not right at present. Accordingly, our clear objective here at home should be to quickly reestablish and permanently maintain U.S. energy independence. Not as a loosely held goal subject to varying political agendas, but as defined and permanent economic and national security imperatives. And we must do so by leveraging ALL U.S. energy resources.  Even European nations have now realized how blind allegiance to politically favored renewables and reliance on foreign energy sources threaten their economies and sovereignty, and they are changing course accordingly.  If the right public policy choices are made, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order.  Not dissimilar from Operation Warp Speed, which mobilized U.S. innovators, manufacturers and other front-line industries to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 in record time, we must now unshackle our full array of energy resources and technologies to meet today’s clear and present dangers.  Looking abroad, we must recognize that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been enabled by two primary catalysts: unnecessarily high global energy prices and Europe’s reliance on Russian energy exports. Sadly, the Biden administration’s "keystoning" of critical domestic energy investments, punitive tax and regulatory policies, and the waiving off of Russian sanctions that helped to drive oil up over $100 per barrel have given Putin predictable leverage and additional means to generate billions to finance his military ambitions.  To address these challenges, there are four overarching objectives the U.S. needs to pursue.  First, we must immediately leverage America’s vast and diverse array of resources and technologies across the entire energy spectrum, including all types of renewable and traditional assets. To do so, we must quickly clear the decks of unnecessary legislative, regulatory and legal roadblocks impacting domestic production and global supplies.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Second, U.S. energy policy can no longer be subject to the political seesaw of whichever political party holds majority power at any particular time. This includes rampant regulatory and legal overreach based on political preferences. Doing so has led to an unstable and contradictory environment for critical public and private investments, resulting in unsustainable price shocks for American businesses, families and consumers. We must therefore apply realistic cost-benefit analysis to all current and future energy policies.  Third, technological viability assessments and national security threats must be fully evaluated and addressed within all government energy programs and policies. For example, much emphasis has been placed on electrifying large portions of our nation’s transportation system, while ignoring that the U.S. is currently dependent on raw materials from countries such as China. Meanwhile, federal and state politicians continue to set costly emissions requirements and price-spiraling fuel standards that are questionable in terms of environmental benefits or knowingly impossible to achieve.  Fourth, in the coming days and months we must make available cheap, clean and affordable energy to our European and Asian allies to deny Putin and other rogue actors the wherewithal to threaten or hold allied nations hostage over energy supplies. We must also help support our allies in diversifying their own energy resources and infrastructure to ensure their long-term safety and sovereignty.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  If the right public policy choices are made at the federal, state and local levels, U.S. energy independence can be reestablished in short order. This will require that we and other nations jettison many of the current domestic regulatory and political obstacles that impede our ability to produce and provide critical energy supplies in timely, cost-effective and safe manners.  Ultimately, this approach – call it Operation Energy Independence – if embraced will lower energy costs and drive down inflation for all Americans while advancing greater peace and prosperity throughout the world.

Maksim Chmerkovskiy is planning on making a return to Europe, less than a week after he fled war-torn Ukraine and made his way back to Los Angeles, Fox News Digital can confirm.  A source close to the "Dancing with the Stars" pro told Fox News Digital that Chmerkovskiy is "working toward helping the refugee assistance efforts along the border."  On Sunday, Chmerkovskiy said that he has "survivor's remorse."  "I spent the last couple of days with survivor's remorse, and I'm currently working on an opportunity to go back," he said during an interview with CNN. "Probably sometime next week I'm going to go back to Poland and join efforts on the ground. Sort of want to justify my safe out that way."  Fox News has reached out to Chmerkovskiy's rep for comment.  A LOOK AT UKRAINIAN STARS WHO’VE VOWED TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AGAINST RUSSIA'S INVASION  During his most recent interview, Chmerkovskiy, 42, spoke about the war between Russia and Ukraine and his experience in the war-torn country days before his departure.  "It wasn't really a decision to leave. It was more like I got told that I have to go," he explained. "The Ukrainian people, in general, they were waiting for this conflict. They were prepared. It was eight years in the making and that was the whole general feeling since I started [working] in Ukraine in September of last year."  Chmerkovskiy went on to share that he was "consulting on a couple of TV shows and dance-related projects."  "The entire time, the feeling was that something is looming," he recalled. "All the time I was being told, 'If something happens, we'll take you out. You'll be the first to move out of the country.'"

"And that morning — I was literally driving to film and at 5 a.m. — someone was bombarding my phone saying, 'You have to go now.'"  Chmerkovskiy detailed that as he was boarding a train to Poland last week, he "fought that internal feeling".  "I felt really bad going, and the feeling sunk in even worse because when I got to the train station, I realized it was all women and children," Chmerkovskiy said. "I'm too big, and I'm taking up space, so I had put myself between trains. I literally moved out of the area where people would've all been and that's the footage that was shown."  MAKSIM CHMERKOVSKIY SAYS HE'S 'SAFE' AFTER FLEEING UKRAINE: 'I FELT WRONG LEAVING'  "Internally, I justified my space 'cause I was outside," he continued. "It wasn't a livable situation because it was too freezing, so I would pace around in that space, come in, thaw out and then go back outside, so I helped a lot with their needs and bags and all that stuff. Just to understand that I'm not just taking up space."  Chmerkovskiy previously said he felt "guilty" leaving Ukraine.  "It's surreal to be honest," Chmerkovskiy said in his first interview since his return to California. "This is a country and the country's on fire, so it was very difficult to process for me because we're used to fly out, do some stuff, experience some things and always fly back. And here I am unable to fly home. That to me was the biggest sort of moment of understanding like you're in trouble."

He said that while he's since reunited with his wife, Peta Murgatroyd , and his kids after taking a flight home from Warsaw, Poland, he is struggling mentally.  "Yeah, I feel guilty. I feel bad. I feel shamed. I feel upset," Chmerkovskiy admitted in the interview with "Good Morning America."  "I'm still very much in a fight or flight. I'm a big boy. I know for a fact that I'm going through something mentally. I get into these crying moments. I can't control it. I cried on the way from the airport. I felt embarrassed the entire ride back because I was the only man on the train amongst all women and children," he said.

The "Heartstrings" star, 76, delivered an opening monologue in which she dedicated the "entire show" to Ukraine, asking everyone to send their prayers to the people of Ukraine in the midst of Russia's invasion.  "I love to laugh, I love to joke, and we're going to have a good time tonight, but I do want us before we get started with all our fun to take a serious moment," Parton said while speaking to a packed Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. "Now I don't want to be political and this is not. I'd rather pass a kidney stone than do that, but I want us to send our love and hope to our brothers and sisters in Ukraine."  "So why don't we just dedicate this entire show to them and pray for peace around this crazy old world?" she added before introducing a collaborative performance featuring Jimmie Allen and Gabby Barrett.  2022 ACMS COMPLETE WINNERS LIST  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed 406 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion began on Feb. 24.

The attack has prompted 1.7 million Ukrainians to flee the country.  In addition to Parton, Matthew Ramsey from Old Dominion also sent his thoughts to Ukraine during their acceptance speech for group of the year.  "I'm so thankful that Dolly said what she said at the beginning because I was feeling a little bit strange because we're in this beautiful bubble here where every person whose name is mentioned tonight has fought for their dreams. But there are people fighting for their lives right now, and it felt a little weird. So I'm so thankful she said that. So thank you. We're so grateful for this award. Couldn't be more thankful."

"I wanted to shine tonight, did I make it?!" she said during her monologue. "I was walking through the hall back here coming on stage, and a disco ball just fell right on me.

Morgan Wallen appeared to move on from his public scandal as he took home an award for album of the year with "Dangerous: The Double Album."  DOLLY PARTON, GABBY BARRETT, JIMMIE ALLEN TO PERFORM AT ACM AWARDS  Following a leaked video showing him using a racial slur, the ACMs announced that they had barred "Wallen's potential involvement and eligibility" from last year's award show. At the time, the 28-year-old was subsequently suspended by his record label, Big Loud Records, and conglomerates like iHeartRadio, which pulled his music from its stations.  Wallen waited months before publicly breaking his silence on the incident, sharing a handwritten letter to fans on social media in April.  In November, Wallen announced "The Dangerous Tour" for 2022.  DOLLY PARTON SET AS ACM AWARDS CO-HOST: 'NO ONE BETTER'  In his ACMs speech on Monday, Wallen made no direct reference to the issue and his absence from recent awards shows, but may have hinted at it as he said that taking home the honor would "signify" to his one-year-old son Indigo Wilder "that his daddy was a fighter and that he chased his dreams and worked hard to make them a reality."  "When I started this album, I was a kid. By the time I put it out, I was a father," he said in part.  Jason Aldean and Carrie Underwood won single of the year for their duet "If I Didn't Love You," while Lainey Wilson won song of the year for "Things a Man Oughta Know." The artists later performed the songs live in a show that was heavy on performances.  Another show-stopping performance was Kelly Clarkson who performed a rendition of the late Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You."  Miranda Lambert, 38, also took home her first-ever win for entertainer of the year and many fans took to social media to praise the country star.  "Unfortunately, Miranda couldn't be here tonight because she's working overseas," Parton said while accepting the award on Lambert's behalf.

"This is my first time missing the ACMs in 17 years," she said. "My heart is a little broken, but I'm happy to be where I am. I've been waiting for this for a really, really long time. I actually never thought it would happen. But thank you so much to the country music family for embracing me all these years and continuing to support me."  "You can say whatever the hell you want.

There are a lot of different ways to protest.  A diner in Quebec decided to show support for Ukraine in a truly unique way. While it hasn't changed the items offered on its menu, it has decided to change the name of a popular Canadian dish.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  Poutine is a popular Canadian dish that includes French fries, cheese curds and gravy. Also, the word "poutine" sounds like the name "Putin" when said out loud.  This connection prompted the apparent inventor of the dish to take action.  Le Roy Jucep, located in Drummondville, Quebec, decided to show solidarity with Ukraine by taking the word "poutine" out of its trademark. The diner claims to have invented the dish and is considered a somewhat famous restaurant among Canadians.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  The diner posted its decision to Facebook last Friday, but it has since removed the post due to receiving hateful replies and phone calls, Montreal CTV News reports. The business' Facebook page still lists it as the inventor of "poutine," although the name has been changed to say "The Inventor of Fries, Cheese and Gravy."  When the story made headlines, however, the restaurant posted a follow-up, saying, "Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that's already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Poutine first started being served in the 1950s. It's a popular dish in Canada and some northern U.S. states, although there are some regional variations.  For example, in New Jersey, a similar dish is served which is known as Disco Fries. It's essentially the same thing, except it uses melted cheese instead of cheese curds.

Beijing remains "all in" for Vladimir Putin, warned a China expert who said the countries’ foreign policies have been "highly coordinated" throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  "Russia and China, they are bad actors," Gordon Chang told Fox News. "They're working together, their militaries drill together, their foreign policies are coordinated."  "This is a new axis," he added.  As Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its 12th day on Monday, Russian forces announced a ceasefire to allow Ukrainian civilians to evacuate cities caught in the siege warfare. Since the invasion, Russian forces have violated multiple temporary ceasefires intended for humanitarian corridors.  CHINA SAYS RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA 'IRON-CLAD' IN WAKE OF RUSSIA'S INVASION  Russia has given no indication that it has swayed from its goal of annexing all of Ukraine.  "Putin has now staked his political life and maybe his life on being successful in Ukraine," Chang said of the Russian president.  Over 11,000 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion, the Ukrainian armed forces' general staff announced Sunday. Ukraine's military announced Monday that its forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv from Russian troops.  "Right now, his forces are not doing as well as intelligence estimates told us," Chang, author of "The Coming Collapse of China," said. "And that means he's in trouble."  "That means he's desperate," he continued. "That means he can do anything."  China has remained relatively quiet on the Ukraine invasion, creating speculation over how close the allies remain. Chinese officials rejected Western pressure to impose sanctions on the Russian government, continuing with "normal trade cooperation."  "There's always been concern in Beijing about China's full-throated support for Putin," Chang said. "But generally, this has only been at the mid- to lower-level officials."  "Where it counts at the top of the Chinese political system, they're all in for Putin," he added.  China's allegiance lies fully with Moscow, Chang said, despite Beijing distancing itself publicly from Russia following the invasion's underperformance.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday called Moscow the "most important strategic partner" to Beijing and said "the friendship between the two peoples is ironclad."  He noted that China's ties to Russia constitute "one of the most crucial bilateral relationships in the world."  Chang recalled the Biden administration's attempt to get China to help avert war leading up to the invasion.  "Biden officials have shared information and intelligence with China in the hopes that China would try to restrain its good friend, Russia," he said. "That didn't happen."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Chinese officials told the U.S. to go take a long walk off a short pier and also shared the intelligence with Russia," Chang continued.  "That's really an indication that China and Russia are very close, and we can't pry China from Russia unless we are willing to impose strict sanctions on Beijing as well as the Russians," Chang told Fox News.

Russian President Vladimir Putin "seems to be bent on destroying his own space industry," Virts, a former commander of the International Space Station, told Fox News.  "There’s just not a lot of business that’s going to be happening for the Russian space agency in the coming decades because of Putin’s evil war that he’s waging," Virts said.  He pointed to a lack of innovation in Russia and said that Putin has used oil and gas money to enrich his cronies rather than develop companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin in the U.S.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The U.S. relied on Russia for rides to and from the space station after the retirement of the space shuttle program in 2011. Launches on American soil resumed in 2020 through a partnership between NASA and SpaceX.  "We don't have that dependence anymore," said Virts. "But there's another dependence, if you will, between Europe and Russia. The Europeans partner with the Russians."  Seven people currently live aboard the International Space Station (ISS), including four Americans, two Russians and one German.  Operations have continued as normal as Putin wages war on the ground in Ukraine, according to NASA.  However, Virts said the real concern is the head of the Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin.  "He just threatened that the space station might de-orbit on American or European soil. He said it doesn't fly over Russian soil, so we don't need to worry about it," said Virts, referencing a series of tweets from Rogozin last month.  "His behavior has been very erratic recently, like Putin," Virts told Fox News. "I don't think anything bad is going to happen. I hope we can maintain our partnership, but the things that Putin has been doing are so dramatically over the red line."  POLISH AMBASSADOR WARNS PUTIN HAS SIGHTS SET BEYOND UKRAINE, CALLS FOR DECADES LONG RUSSIAN SANCTIONS  NASA told Fox News in a statement: "NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station. No changes are planned to the agency’s support for ongoing in orbit and ground station operations."  Virts said: "The overriding imperative for NASA and the Russian space agency — we can't give the crew conflicting directions. We can't put them at odds with each other."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We need to be adults down here on Earth and make sure that we don't put the crew in that situation," Virts continued. "I know that NASA's not going to do that … and I hope that the Russians have the same philosophy."  Virts commanded the space station in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea. He said during that time, he made a point to eat dinner with his Russian colleagues every night.  "'Politics is politics,' is how we would start at every meeting, and 'let's just leave what's happening on Earth on Earth, because we're just trying to stay alive in space,' that was our main goal," said Virts. "So, I would expect that they're being very professional, very friendly with each other."  Fox News' Isabelle McDonnell contributed to this report.

Poland’s ambassador to the United States told Fox News he believes Russia has military ambitions beyond Ukraine and called for economic sanctions to potentially last for decades against the Putin regime.    "I believe Ukraine is not the last item on Mr. Putin's menu," said Ambassador Marek Magierowski, who spoke with Fox News from the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C.    "We have to be ready and determined to uphold the sanctions. Perhaps even for a decade or for 15 years or for 20 years, in order to see to the real effects," Magierowski said.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES  Magierowski told Fox News that Poland announced Thursday it would increase its own military spending to 3% of the country’s GDP.  Saturday marked the tenth day since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale war against Ukraine.  Magierowski said Poland and other former Soviet satellite republics have always been weary of Putin’s ambitions.  FORMER UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR ON PUTIN'S KILL LIST CALLS ON BIDEN, AMERICA 'TO BE LEADER OF THE WORLD'  "We have always been right about Russia and about Mr. Putin. Unlike other countries, I mean Poland, Romania, the Baltics, we have never had any doubts whatsoever about the neo-imperial ambitions of the Russian president," Magierowski said.  On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met virtually with U.S. senators, imploring the lawmakers to send additional lethal aid.  Magierowski echoed Zelenskyy’s sentiment that Ukraine needs more weapons support.  RUSSIA TIES POSSIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL REVIVAL TO UKRAINE SANCTIONS  "Ukraine is not a native member state, so technically and formally and legally, we cannot defend as ally if we cannot defend Ukraine militarily," Magierowski said. "But within the framework of international cooperation, I think we can keep delivering weapons to Ukraine."  The Russian invasion has prompted 1.4 million refugees to flee the violence, according to reports. Many of those traveled across Ukraine’s border with Poland.  "There are now about 700,000 Ukrainian refugees who have crossed the border since the beginning of the hostilities," said Magierowski.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Polish ambassador pointed out that despite the country taking on hundreds of thousands of refugees, Poland hasn’t constructed a single refugee camp. Magierowski says this is because the Polish people have welcomed refugees into their homes.  "This is probably the very first refugee crisis in Europe in which no refugee camps have been set up," he said  "And all those Ukrainians who have arrived in Poland have been admitted into Polish homes, which is pretty remarkable and really impressive."

Ukraine's fighting spirit will bleed Russia's military dry, a U.S. Special Forces veteran told Fox News.  "I look at the unconventional warfare or the fight that's happening there, and I think you're going to see a lot of guerrilla warfare coming soon," U.S. Army retired Lt. Col. Scott Mann said.  "These cities are going to get overrun, and it's going to be a long, long haul for the Russians," Mann continued. "If they think because they occupy these cities, that they're done – if you look at the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people – they are in for a nasty guerrilla warfare campaign that is going to bleed them dry."  The retired Green Beret commander told Fox News the situation in Ukraine is unfolding opposite to the way things played out in Afghanistan.  UKRAINE NUCLEAR PLANT UPDATE: RUSSIAN ATTACK RELEASED NO RADIATION, IAEA CHIEF SAYS: LIVE UPDATES  "I’ve got to think that the Taliban are not liking what's going on in Ukraine right now," Mann said. "People are watching that and it is inspiring, regardless of your politics, to see people make a stand like that."  Mann, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, founded Task Force Pineapple, a group that helped evacuate Afghan refugees after the country fell into the hands of the Taliban last year.  The group is not involved in Ukraine because, according to Mann, the circumstances are different.  "Even though it is horrific warfare, you have kind of a linear battlefield, and you have nation states," said Mann. "I think volunteer groups, we have to be really careful about how we engage here and what we do."  Mann equated the final days of the Afghanistan withdrawal to the "wild, wild west." He said Pineapple came together because of his team’s specific knowledge of the country, which wouldn’t translate in Ukraine.  HOW HUNDREDS OF AFGHANS WERE SAVED FROM THE TALIBAN BY VETERANS IN A DIGITAL DUNKIRK: THE LAST 96  He told Fox News there are three reasons why the war in Ukraine is unfolding differently from the fall of Afghanistan.  "The first one is leadership," Mann said.  "If you contrast just the internal leadership at senior levels inside Ukraine versus Afghanistan, it is stark," he continued. "You have the president of Ukraine saying ‘We don't need a ride, we need ammo,’ … ‘if you can't control the sky, give me planes,’ versus [then-Afghan President-Ashraf] Ghani and his staff scrambling for helicopters unannounced to flee and leave their people high and dry."  Ukraine’s embrace of nationalism is the second, according to Mann.  "Ukraine has a national identity, and it runs deep, and they fight for it," Mann told Fox News.  "Afghanistan historically has not been as keen on a national identity," he continued. "It's primarily a status society, a tribal society."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "The final one is the nature of the threat," he said.  "If you look at Ukraine, they're facing an external threat," Mann continued. "Nothing unifies people more than an external threat"  "It brings us together fast, whether it's a hurricane or the Russian bear," he said. "Whereas with the Taliban, that was an internal threat, that was a long-term insurgency that, you know, really applied a thousand cuts to the Afghan government."

Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage refinance rates have mostly risen since yesterday; only 10-year rates remained unchanged.  Rates last updated on March 8, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. With more than 4,500 reviews, Credible maintains an "excellent" Trustpilot score.  What this means: With longer-term rates creeping up again, homeowners who are interested in refinancing might look to shorter terms today. Rates for a 10-year term have held at or below 3% for six consecutive days.  Today’s mortgage rates for home purchases  Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage rates for home purchases have risen across all terms since yesterday.  Rates last updated on March 8, 2022. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 4,500 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).  What this means: After dropping fairly significantly last week and into the beginning of this week, mortgage rates are on their way up again. But with rates for 20-, 15-, and 10-year terms still well below 4%, homebuyers have time to lock in a lower rate ahead of further increases. Buyers who act now can lock in a rate for 30, 60, or sometimes even 90 days.  To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.  How mortgage rates have changed over time  Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.  The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage or refinance, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.  Are you looking to buy a home?

Thousands of Trustpilot reviewers rate Credible "excellent."  How Credible mortgage rates are calculated  Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment, and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.  The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.  Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.  What is a good mortgage rate?  Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.  A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.  If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credible's free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.  Have a finance-related question, but don't know who to ask?

Automobile club AAA shows Tuesday's national average at $4.17, up from $4.06 on Monday and $2.77 a year ago.  GAS PRICES SURGE ACROSS THE NATION: HOW TO FIND CHEAP PRICES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has compounded problems beset by lingering supply chain issues.  However, there are several ways for drivers can conserve fuel when they hit the road.  Automaker Toyota Motor Corporation recommends pressing the accelerator pedal gently, avoiding rapid starts and stops, staying alert on the road to anticipate the movements of others, checking tire pressure, carrying less cargo, combining trips, not using the air conditioner at low speeds and reducing heater use in the winter.  The U.S. Department of Energy reports that aggressive driving can lower gas mileage by roughly 15%-30% at highway speeds and 10%-40% in stop-and-go traffic. The agency recommends the use of driver feedback devices to curb this issue.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS  In addition, the department warned against hauling cargo on the roof of a car, which increases wind resistance and lowers fuel economy.  It said that a large, blunt rooftop cargo box can reduce fuel economy by around 2%-8% in city driving, 6%-17% on the highway and 10%-25% at interstate speeds.  Idling can use a quarter to a half-gallon of fuel each hour, the department notes, depending on engine size and air conditioning use.  AAA says that people should look for models of cars that offer the best fuel economy in their classes, maintain their cars according to the manufacturer's recommendations and repair cars as soon as possible.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  The club said drivers should adjust speed to "time" the traffic lights, take their foot off the gas early when approaching a red light or a stop sign, accelerate smoothly, use cruise control and upshift as soon as is possible without "lugging" the engine if the car has a manual transmission.

In an address on Russian state television, Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, warned that the "rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market," suggesting the price per barrel could double to $300, BBC reported.  Given the European Union gets 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, Novak asserted it would be "impossible to quickly find a replacement for Russian oil on the European market."  BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE BAN ON US IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL: SOURCE  "It will take years, and it will still be much more expensive for European consumers," he warned, according to the BBC. "Ultimately, they will be hurt the worst by this outcome."  "In connection with unfounded accusations against Russia regarding the energy crisis in Europe and the imposition of a ban on Nord Stream 2," he said, according to Reuters. "We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline."  "But so far we are not taking such a decision," Novak added.  President Biden on Tuesday is expected to announce a U.S. embargo on Russia oil and gas, FOX Business confirmed. He is to make the remarks at the White House announcing, "actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine."  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday had called for "boycotts" on Russian oil imports.  But even with the U.S. on board, it’s unclear if European allies and partners will follow suit.  On Monday, Germany and the Netherland rejected plans for an embargo, BBC reported.

FIRST ON FOX: More than 30 House Republicans are urging the Biden administration to end COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truckers and agricultural workers coming across the U.S. border, warning that the mandates risk having a "catastrophic effect" on the supply chain crisis.  The Department of Homeland Security in January began requiring non-U.S.citizens coming across the border via ports of entry to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. That includes truck drivers and workers coming across on H-2A temporary agricultural worker visas.  GOP SENATORS RENEW EFFORTS TO DEFUND BIDEN'S VACCINE MANDATES  While cities across the country, including those with vaccine mandates, have started rolling back COVID-19 restrictions, there are no signs they will be relaxed at the border -- including ports of entry. COVID-19 restrictions also remain in place for those crossing the border illegally in the form of Title 42.  In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejadro Mayorkas, 36 lawmakers led by Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. point out the ongoing supply chain crisis and the worker shortage the country is currently facing, which requires an increase in the number of agricultural workers being brought into the U.S.  "Now that these H-2A workers are required to be fully vaccinated to enter the U.S., we have heard from numerous farmers and constituents who worry that these new vaccination requirements are delaying and will continue to delay the arrival of H-2A workers this year," the lawmakers wrote. "These limitations and delays will have a catastrophic impact on our already fragile supply chain and proliferate rising food prices."  Many H-2A workers come from Mexico, and the lawmakers argue that vaccine availability varies widely across Mexico, and some of the vaccines available are not accepted by the U.S. The lawmakers urge the Biden administration to allow for an exemption for that reason.  "Despite the historic supply and labor shortages, the Biden administration has upheld this restrictive vaccine mandate," Norman told Fox News in a statement. "Agricultural employers already depend on nonimmigrant foreign workers to fill domestic labor shortages. This policy does little to mitigate the spread of the virus and hurts essential industries along the way."  Additionally, the lawmakers highlight the importance of foreign truckers in being the "backbone of America’s supply chain." Truckers in Canada have organized mass protests over the country’s vaccine mandates, and truckers in the U.S. are planning on making similar demonstrations over the cross-border vaccine regulations.  "While in the midst of a global pandemic and supply chain crisis, we must ensure necessary cross-border operations to bring essential goods into the U.S. are unhindered and stabilized," the Republican lawmakers argue in the letter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Republicans urge the administration to allow flexibility for employers and employees on the restrictions.  The letter marks the latest instance of Republicans pushing back against vaccine mandates imposed by the federal government. Last month in the Senate, lawmakers rallied against a continuing resolution, demanding a vote first on an amendment to end various federal mandates.

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., slammed the Biden administration for its energy policy as the White House faces growing calls to ban Russian oil imports. Fitzpatrick, who returned from a trip to the Ukraine border, joined "Fox & Friends" on Tuesday arguing "you can't reason with crazy" as he explained the importance of unleashing American energy to reduce the global alliance on Russian oil.  GAS PRICES FUELING COMING DEMOCRATIC BLOODBATH IN MIDTERMS, REPUBLICANS SAY  BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, you can't reason with crazy. This is common sense. A third-grader could tell you this. We have all the energy resources we need in this country, not only to be energy independent in America, but also to be the largest energy exporter to Europe so that they don't need to rely on Russia or Saudi Arabia or anybody else. Everybody knows the answer to this. It's politics, pure and simple, that's blocking this administration from doing the right thing.  WATCH THE ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ INTERVIEW BELOW:

A Saudi prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay detention center who was suspected of trying to join the 9/11 hijackers has been sent back to his home country for treatment for mental illness, the Department of Defense said Monday.  Mohammad Ahmad al-Qahtani was flown back to Saudi Arabia, to a treatment facility, from the U.S. base in Cuba after a review board including military and intelligence officials concluded he could be safely released after 20 years in custody.  SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH GOVERNMENT IN GITMO STATE SECRETS CASE    The 46-year-old prisoner has suffered from mental illness, including schizophrenia, since childhood, according to medical examinations and records obtained by his lawyers. The U.S. dropped plans to try him after a Bush administration legal official concluded he had been tortured at Guantanamo.    With his release, there are now 38 prisoners left at the detention center. He is the second released under President Biden, who has said he intends to close the facility.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The United States appreciates the willingness of Saudi Arabia and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts toward a deliberate and thorough process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing of the Guantanamo Bay facility," the Department of Defense said in a statement announcing the repatriation of al-Qahtani.  However, only half the men held there have been cleared for release, and no decision has been made about what to do with the rest, including those who still face trial by military commission.    The Defense Department notified Congress of its intention to transfer al-Qahtani in February, prompting outrage from some Republicans.  AT LEAST 22 INJURED IN BRAWL AT MEXICAN SOCCER MATCH    Lawyers for al-Qahtani obtained a federal court order in 2020 requiring a medical examination of the prisoner by an independent medical panel, which could have ordered his repatriation under Army regulations if the diagnosis of his doctors was confirmed. The Trump administration contested the order, a legal fight that was dropped under Biden.  "After two decades without trial in U.S. custody, Mohammed will now receive the psychiatric care he has long needed in Saudi Arabia, with the support of his family," said Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York who represented al-Qahtani with help from students for over a decade. "Keeping him at Guantanamo, where he was tortured, and then repeatedly attempted suicide, would have been a likely death sentence."  In August 2001, al-Qahtani was turned away from the U.S. at the Orlando airport by immigration officers who were suspicious of his travel. The lead Sept. 11 hijacker, Mohammed Atta, was going to pick him up to take part in the plot, according to previously released documents.  U.S. forces later captured him in Afghanistan and sent him to Guantanamo, where he was subjected to brutal interrogations that the Pentagon legal official in charge of war crimes commissions said amounted to torture.  That treatment included beatings, exposure to extreme temperatures and noise, sleep deprivation and extended solitary confinement. An FBI official in 2002 observed al-Qahtani speaking to non-existent people, hearing voices and crouching in a corner of his cell while covering himself with a sheet for hours at a time.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    The 38 remaining prisoners at Guantanamo include 19 who have been approved for repatriation or resettlement by the review board. There are another seven who are eligible for review. Ten prisoners face trial by military commission, including five charged with involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Their death penalty case has been stalled for years in the pretrial phase.  The remaining two prisoners at the base have been convicted, one of whom, former Maryland resident Majid Khan, is nearing the completion of his sentence under a plea deal.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid some blame for deaths in his country on Western nations not imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.  "Thirteen days, during which we've been just hearing promises, when they tell us that yes, very, very soon you'll get help in the sky, there’ll be planes given to us," Zelenskyy said during a speech Tuesday.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The fault lies with the invaders," Zelenskyy added. "But the responsibility for this lies also with those who have not been able to make an obviously necessary decision somewhere in the West, somewhere in the offices for 13 days. Those who have not yet secured the Ukrainian sky from Russian murderers . Those who did not save our cities from airstrikes, from these bombs, missiles, although they can."  Zelenskyy has implored world leaders to impose a no-fly zone over his country, including to President Biden , NATO and to more than 280 U.S. lawmakers. But the issue of imposing a no-fly zone is far more complicated than just prohibiting aircraft over Ukraine, according to U.S. and world leaders.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US IMPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE?  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  "The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace , and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. "We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe."  A no-fly zone risks a direct military conflict with Russia, which could potentially escalate to a third world war, pitting nuclear power countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. against fellow nuclear power Russia .  10-YEAR-OLD UKRAINIAN GIRL SHOT AND KILLED BY 'DRUNK RUSSIAN SOLDIERS,' FAMILY SAYS  " If people understand what it means , it means World War III. It means starting World War III," Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Saturday on ABC's "This Week." "It's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by.

In a written vigil excerpt from Monday, Feb. 28, which was provided to Fox News Digital, the St. Nicholas Cathedral School prayed for the safety and protection of all those affected by the war.  "There are people that are protecting their land by fighting in the armed services, volunteer battalions, and militias. These people are heroes, they are the pride of the country for putting their lives on the line for the safety of Ukraine and for all of Europe," St. Nicholas Cathedral School vigil participants said during their prayer. "There are innocent civilians that are paying the price of a war that they did not want. Too many people have become refugees, while others remain in hiding."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  The prayer vigil participants continued their invocation by noting that families are being separated and are unsure of when they’ll be able to see each other again.  "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not new, but Ukraine is its own independent country with its own history, beliefs, culture, language, and traditions," vigil participants said.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  The Ukrainian American Youth Association – an American branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM), a patriotic and faith-based nonprofit scouting organization – has been spreading awareness about prayer vigils and peaceful protests throughout the country.  Two days before Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv, the Ukrainian American Youth Association had urged its members to contact the White House to honor the Budapest Memorandum and put sanctions on Russia on Facebook. The organization’s call to "help Ukraine" came about after weeks of tension grew between the two countries as Russia built up its military near Ukraine’s borders.  The organization’s Ohio youth chapter CYM Cleveland was one of the first to hold a "Cleveland Pray for Ukraine" event before Russia’s attack, according to a news post from the Ukrainian Youth Association website.

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern will be in attendance at Taste of the NFL – a pre-Super Bowl LVI culinary experience that aims to combat childhood hunger and food insecurity by raising funds and awareness for vulnerable groups.  Zimmern told FOX News Edge that he got involved with the annual benefit through his work with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization GENYOUth, which has partnered with Taste of the NFL for Super Bowl 2022. The two anti-hunger charities are organizing a ticketed live event at the world-renowned Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb. 12, where food and football will collide.  "Folks can come and participate, come down to interact with incredible chefs and the performance that we're doing with the demos live on stage as well as, you know, have a fantastic party with a purpose to raise money [and] provide hunger solutions for students in schools, which is what GENYOUth now specializes in," Zimmern said in a video interview with FOX. "They're one of the leaders in the country at this, and we're trying to raise as much money as possible."  FRIED HONEY BUTTER CHICKEN BISCUITS FOR YOUR NFL FOOTBALL PARTY: TRY THE RECIPE  He noted that childhood hunger has been exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation continue. These two challenges are especially concerning for Zimmern, who has been a hunger relief advocate for 30 years and has worked with various equity boards, including the New York-based Services for the UnderServed, the International Rescue Committee and more recently the United Nations World Food Programme as a goodwill ambassador.  "I haven't come across a problem that is as deadly and as crisis-filled as the global and national hunger crisis that we are currently enduring," Zimmern said. "I'm staggered by this… To me, it is the biggest head-scratcher of head-scratchers."  Zimmern went on to say that while he’s grateful nongovernmental organizations have stepped up to combat hunger, he wants the world to realize that a society that’s eliminated hunger with nutritious foods is likely to face economic and public health benefits, including less money spent on preventable food-related diseases, an improvement to national security, decreased pressure on the criminal justice system and overall productivity.  FOOTBALL BUTTERCREAM SUGAR COOKIES FOR GAME DAY DESSERT: TRY THE RECIPE  In his own words, "Food is both a tool for understanding other people, and it's also a solution to improving lives both here in America and around the world."

People watch football at home with their loved ones and they cook.  He continued, "As someone who loves educating, who loves providing adventure and joy in the kitchen and believes in putting food on people's plates, what a wonderful time of year, both to be celebrating food, but also raising money for a fantastic cause and making sure that those that don't have food are provided for."

Zimmern explained that remoulade – a French sauce – had been influenced by Spanish, Caribbean and West African flavors by the time it made its way to Louisiana.  Zimmern makes his recipe with a shrimp boil mixed with mustard seeds, chile fennel, lemon slices, chopped celery and onions, a can of beer and other seasonings, and he lets the ingredients simmer and steep at 200 degrees for 20 minutes or so.  In a food processor, Zimmern makes the remoulade from scratch with chile and Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, eggs, chopped scallions and celery, minced garlic, a spice mix with whole mustard seeds, horseradish, white vinegar and Old Bay seasoning.  Zimmern recommends pulsing the processor a few times before pouring in vegetable oil and letting it emulsify. After the ingredients blend together, the remoulade can be refrigerated while the shrimp cooks.

He then covers the shrimp with ice to trap the flavor. Zimmern serves the shrimp with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, lemon wedges, Cajun seasonings, celery leaves and the remoulade sauce.  "Shrimp remoulade is one of the fastest, tastiest, most delicious treats that you could possibly imagine," Zimmern told FOX.  "I don't think there's a better dish. You [can] do it all ahead of time and simply pour the sauce on right before your guests get there. They can dip if they want. They can plate if they want. You can make a big batch, a small batch. You can do this with other meats or seafood or everything if you don't like shrimp, but I think it's fantastic."

Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619 when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.  Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW  From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.  Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.  Sojourner Truth  Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.  Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.  By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2022: MARYLAND TEACHER KEISHIA THORPE, WINNER OF GLOBAL TEACHER PRIZE, INSPIRES MANY  Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.  Baumfree famously delivered her "Ain’t I a Woman?" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Abraham Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book "The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave" (1850).  Frederick Douglass  Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.  He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.  Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" speech (1852) and "Life and Times of Frederick Douglass" autobiography (1881).  ALVEDA KING REVEALS HOW TO BE MORE LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN 2022  Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education, and the end of capital punishment.  Harriet Tubman  Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.  She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.  Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made "about 13 trips into Maryland" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to "about 70 more," according to the NPS.  By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.  George Washington Carver  Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.  While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.  Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.  YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE  Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.  Ida B. Wells  American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.  Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.  Some of her famous written works include "Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases" (1893) and "Mob Rule in New Orleans" (1900).  Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.  W. E. B. Du Bois  American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.  He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.  Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including "Black Reconstruction in America," "The Souls of Black Folk" and "The Talented Tenth."  Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that "builds Black political power to end structural racism."  Thurgood Marshall  Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.  He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.  From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.  THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE  Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were "separate but equal."  Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.  His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon B. Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.  Rosa Parks  Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.  At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.  The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.  The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.  She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.  Shirley Chisholm  Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.  In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.  Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director, and educational consultant before entering politics.  Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, where she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.  Martin Luther King Jr.  Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.  He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.  King delivered his most famous speech, "I Have a Dream," on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954 to 1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.  But it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photographs and video.

Why hasn’t cyber figured more prominently in Russia’s war on Ukraine? Russia is, after all, a powerhouse in this area having successfully cyber-attacked Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2015-2016. Add to that an unexpectedly difficult start to the current, long-planned campaign against Ukraine and the question becomes even more perplexing. Analysts have many and varied views on the matter and recent reporting has laid out almost a dozen different potential explanations. Some suggest there is no need to go there, and that the possible downside outweighs any upsides. Others suggest that Putin may still go there - just not yet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The latter explanation is compelling if only because it requires us not to let down our guard and to continue marching forward on plans to expand and deepen America’s own cyber resilience posture and abilities to withstand cyber and electronic warfare. The good news is that certain key sectors that represent critical infrastructure and support vital national functions have been enhancing their defenses for years. Think financial services and energy for example.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  The bad news is that other equally important sectors are nowhere near as prepared. Think water - which is working to up its game but is nowhere near where it needs to be as the recent spate of ransomware has made clear. And this is the state of play among the big dogs. Yet the U.S. is an incredibly target-rich environment for any adversary because of the sprawling decentralized nature of both its public and private sector. Put differently: Small and medium size enterprises are not outside the crosshairs.  JAMES JAY CARAFANO: WHAT CHINA IS LEARNING FROM PUTIN'S UKRAINE INVASION  Officials have been working hard to raise awareness and offer assistance to both public and private entities that may not have the resources or ability to properly protect themselves on their own in the current climate that is so rife with potential cyber threats. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (better known as CISA) has been doing yeoman’s work in this area. But the scope of the challenge is enormous.  So where should we go from here? We must better marshal our efforts so that the piecemeal and uneven progress that has been made to date becomes a more streamlined national effort that makes it far harder for any adversary to achieve its ends. Having a National Cyber Director (NCD) to act as coordinator and definitively take point on the all-important task of prioritizing our game plans and facilitating their execution in a way that ensures that they will be more than just the sum of their parts is a true step forward.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  But the NCD will not be able to go it alone. Public and private efforts must cohere and partnerships must be more meaningful than ever before. It’s a tall order but the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) under CISA auspices is a powerful tool that could rise to the challenge if all stakeholders determinedly make that their mission. Among its payoffs could be better situational awareness than the nation has ever had - and coordinated operations that give bad actors a serious run for their money.      We may not yet be where we need to be, but we can’t take our eyes off the ball. So far the conflict in Ukraine may not have unfolded exactly as Russia thought it would; but these are still early days in what is likely to be a long and punishing war. Longtime expert Putin-watchers underscore that he may lash out further should he feel cornered. He has already made an implied threat concerning the use of nuclear weapons. And now Russian forces claim to have taken over a nuclear plant in Ukraine - the largest such plant in Europe.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    What comes next is anybody’s guess. But forewarned is forearmed. Let’s push down the path to better preparedness as fast and hard as we can so that we don’t end up regretting that we missed our chance to do so.  Frank J.

Russia’s economy is proving much less resilient than the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. In the wake of the Russian invasion, countries across the world moved swiftly to disconnect President Vladimir Putin’s war machine from the global market, and the result is an economy in freefall.  Unsurprisingly, the Chinese Communist Party refuses to join in the sanctions. But Communist China is not Putin’s only supporter.  Recent reporting reveals that Iran is supplying Russia with illicit oil supplies to finance his war in Ukraine. This is alarming to say the least, because America and its allies are on the verge of providing a $10 billion windfall to the terrorist regime in Tehran.  RUSSIAN OFFICIAL SAYS ‘IRAN GOT MUCH MORE THAN IT EXPECTED’ IN REVIVED NUCLEAR TALKS  For reasons that are still unclear, the Biden administration has long sought to revive the failed Obama-era 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Reports suggest an agreement is imminent, with the lead Russian negotiator in the talks saying Russia and China teamed up and "Iran got much more than it could expect. Much more." Whether that is an exaggeration or not, removing sanctions and allowing the sale of Iranian oil across the globe would be a massive victory for Tehran — and a massive loss for the U.S.  While most of the media coverage this week will focus on rising oil prices, this Wednesday also marks 15 years since the Iranian government kidnapped Florida resident and former FBI agent Bob Levinson.  Levinson was held in captivity for longer than any other U.S. citizen in history. For 10 years, I worked with his family to secure information about his status and bring him home. Tragically, Levinson died in captivity sometime in 2020. The Iranian authorities still deny responsibility for his capture and death.  IRAN NEARING NUCLEAR THRESHOLD, WITH US OPTIONS TO STOP IT NARROWING, REPORT WARNS  Iran’s is a murderous, backstabbing, and fundamentally anti-American regime. The case of Bob Levinson makes that clear enough, but unfortunately, the Levinsons are not the only family to have lost a loved one at the hands of Tehran.  The Iranian regime and its proxies spent nearly two decades killing American service members in Iraq.  The Iranians support Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Hamas in Palestine, and numerous other Shia militant groups throughout the Middle East, as well as Nicolás Maduro’s tyrannical narco-regime in Venezuela.  Iran is also responsible for multiple acts of cyberterrorism. And agents from Tehran have plotted to kill Iranian dissidents on the sovereign soil of Western states like the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  We know from experience how Tehran will use its windfall. When the Obama administration established the first nuclear deal in 2015, Iran did not live up to its end of the bargain. On the contrary, Tehran used its newfound funds to develop its ballistic missile program, strengthen Hezbollah and the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and crack down on domestic dissent. All the while, the Iranian authorities continued nuclear weaponization experiments at a secret facility.  There is no doubt that the Biden administration and many Western governments are feeling the pressure of high oil prices. President Biden is desperate to bring energy costs down without upsetting the fanatical left wing of this party, so desperate that he would rather import bloodstained Iranian oil than permit further energy exploration in the U.S.  He is also running to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as if foreign oil were better for the climate than American oil. This is pathetic, and Americans deserve better. The family of Bob Levinson deserves better.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  By reviving the failed Iran deal, the Biden administration will fill the coffers of a murderous, terrorist regime, without putting an end to Iran’s nuclear weaponization. And some of that windfall may find its way to Russia, fueling Putin’s war machine.  It will go down in history as one of the president’s most disastrous foreign policy decisions.

A water engineering nonprofit has sent a team to Ukraine's borders and neighboring countries in order to assess the safe water, sanitation and hygiene needs of tens of thousands of displaced refugees.  Water Mission's rapid responders, who are working alongside other humanitarian organizations in the region, are in the midst of determining where the biggest populations of refugees are. Once that's determined, they look into what safe water resources they can tap into, or if any safe water resources exist, in order to determine how to bring emergency safe water systems where they are needed most.  HELPING UKRAINIAN REFUGEES: NONPROFIT DELIVERING THOUSANDS OF HOT MEALS TO PEOPLE IN NEED  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  "As it becomes clear what role we're going to play, then we'll send over all the staff we need to run our response," Water Mission Senior Director Global Partnerships John Peays told Fox News.  Since 2001, the nonprofit has been implementing safe water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions for developing countries and disaster areas. To date, they have helped over seven million people in 57 countries.  One of the biggest areas of need during the current crisis, Peays projected, will be right on Ukraine's borders, where there is a build-up of cars, buses, and refugees on foot trying to escape into neighboring countries.  In fact, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted Monday that some wait times at Ukraine's borders are nearing 50 hours.  During any crisis, Water Missions CEO George Greene said "the need for emergency safe water access is critical for survival."  For instance, Greene told Fox News that "you can very quickly get into a situation where improvised water sources like shallow wells and trying to get water out of the ground, or even people drinking water directly out of rivers and nearby areas… get contaminated with human waste in an excessive way."  It can lead to water-borne illnesses and the worst case is when "cholera outbreaks happen," he said.  Cholera, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a "diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria."  People can get sick once they swallow food or water that has been contaminated with the bacteria, the CDC explains.

A nonprofit has been serving tens of thousands of hot meals to Ukrainians who are stuck in Ukraine or who have fled to neighboring countries.  CHURCHES IN UKRAINE, RUSSIA DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO EMBATTLED CITIZENS  For over a decade, the World Central Kitchen has provided meals to communities in need in the wake of humanitarian, climate and community crises.  When the conflict began to unfold in Ukraine, World Central Kitchen CEO Nate Mook told Fox News that the organization hit the ground running.  "We were watching as families were fleeing across the border into Poland and other countries," he said. "And so immediately we activated our team."  On Friday, the nonprofit, which teamed up with local chefs and restaurants, began serving hot meals at the 24-hour pedestrian border crossing in southern Poland. Since then, they have sent teams to a number of refugee shelters and other border crossings in Romania, Hungary and Moldova.  Mook said the first step was getting his team on the ground, including himself, as quickly as possible.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We've got meals that are being served throughout the day and all through the night," he said.  They have already distributed tens of thousands of meals with another 25,000 expected to be delivered on Tuesday, according to Mook.  "We're just moving as quickly as possible to get as much food to those that need it," he said.  Mook admitted that it's already been a pretty daunting journey.  "We're talking to a lot of Ukrainians and others who are fleeing Ukraine, and they're traveling for days," he said.  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  Mook said his team met a Ukrainian woman who walked 40 miles just to get to the border of Poland and then waited another 12 hours to cross the border.  In another instance, a young woman from Kyiv had walked two days in order to reach the border into Ukraine without a single hot meal.  "I think pretty much everyone we've been meeting has been in a state of shock," Mook said. "I don't think anybody really expected it to intensify this quickly or have to just literally run away from their homes, sometimes their families and friends."  The nonprofit is also working with restaurants in two Ukrainian cities, Odesa and Lviv, to help feed families that haven't fled.  "We're just here to cover as many gaps as possible," he added. "The most important thing is to appeal to folks who really need them right now."

A Ukrainian American mother in Iowa is hoping her son can reunite with his wife and 1-year-old son as he remains behind the Ukraine border amid the Russia-Ukraine war.  Irena Laura Yoder of Dubuque, Iowa, told Fox News Digital she urged her son TJ — whose surname she wanted omitted for privacy reasons — to flee the city of Kyiv as the world braced for Russian troops to act under Vladimir Putin’s command.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I told them, ‘You need to leave the country,'" Yoder said.  "I trust the news in the U.S. and I saw what Biden was saying. I said, ‘There’s going to be a war,'" she relayed to Fox News Digital.  Yoder, a Ukraine native, said the invasion has been a "long time coming."  "Putin hates Ukraine," Yoder said bluntly. "He hates the people and the Ukrainian language. He wanted to completely destroy and scratch off from the earth the Ukrainian word … no country, no such thing."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘HUMANITARIAN SITUATION DETERIORATING RAPIDLY’  Yoder left Ukraine with TJ in 1998 for a new life in the U.S. after escaping from an abusive relationship, she said.  "My [youngest] son Dimitri called me and said, ‘Hi, Mom.’ His voice was shaking. I said, ‘Is it morning?’ He said, ‘No.' I knew it was a war." — Irena Laura Yoder to Fox News Digital  "Also, because of some political views," Yoder added.  "It still was the Soviet Union before and still lots of political pressure and communism was around. It was very corrupt. I didn’t like that."  Yoder, a mother of two, has a 20-year-old son currently attending college in Iowa.  Her son TJ, 35, was living in Ukraine with his wife Viktoria and their 1-year-old son, Mark, when Russia invaded in late February.  UKRAINE'S DISPLACED CHILDREN REUNITED WITH MOMS IN POLAND  "On the 24th, I went to bed that night. I work at the hospital," Yoder said.  "My [youngest] son Dimitri called me and said, ‘Hi, Mom.’ His voice was shaking. I said, ‘Is it morning?’ He said, ‘No.' Then, I knew it was a war."  Yoder said TJ called her next.  "He’s like, ‘Mom, they started bombing. They started war,'" Yoder said, adding that TJ said he heard sirens.  "It was awful," she added. "So scary."  TJ and his family packed their car and left Kyiv for the Poland border, though TJ was unable to cross, since Ukrainian officials banned men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the nation.  A million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, according to the United Nations.  "I pray every day to see my family again even though I have a feeling, time to time, I might not." — TJ, son of Irena Laura Yoder  Yoder said her daughter-in-law was adamant about not separating from TJ. Yet their young son Mark has cysts on his brain and severe neurological issues — which require medical attention.  TJ, who’s currently sheltering roughly 80 miles outside the border, told Fox News Digital he’s willing to fight, though there aren’t enough weapons and gear as of now.  HALF A MILLION CHILDREN BECOME REFUGEES AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR DESTROYS HOMES AND SERVICES  "It’s a deficit," TJ said via a messaging app.  On Thursday, New York politician Bruce Blakeman announced a gun drive for legal gun owners to donate weapons to be shipped to Ukraine, where citizens are defending themselves against the Russian invaders.  Donations of unloaded rifles, shotguns, or AR-15s or other long gun weapons from legal gun owners are to be sent to the Ukrainian people.  As for food and water, TJ said his situation is "OK."  "Lots of shelves are starting to be empty, depending [on] what region a person is in," he said.  "I know I’m a mom, but I can’t baby him the rest of my life." — Irena Laura Yoder about her son  TJ said he’s still in communication with his wife and child, who are currently in Warsaw.

"I’m happy they made it out and are safe in Poland at the moment because it’s getting worse and worse … Ukraine definitely needs more help."  "She [my wife] wants us to reunite and live as we lived before without our terror," TJ added.  Yoder said the last time she saw her son was in September, during a trip to Ukraine. Now, she’s following his journey through war.  "When I told him I worry about him, he said, ‘Mom, if you cry I cry, you laugh I laugh, you die I die,’" Yoder said, adding that her son is ready to "go to war" and protect his family.

She currently lives in Covington, Louisiana, where she's participated in rallies to support her native country.

I am grateful for their safety, and hope and pray for others to find a safe place too."  Shortly after Russia first invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Dufren said her friends – a majority who live in Kyiv – awoke to bomb explosions. The mother of one said this week that her friends have "made it safely to the West" of Ukraine, but that their travels were far from easy.  "They had a very hard time getting there. I still have one close friend who remains in Kyiv. They are not living now in very comfortable conditions, but they are safe. Some of my friends are currently in a homeless shelter because there are no places for them to stay," the star, who is managed by Dominion Talent House, shared.

Dufren has lived in the United States for two and a half years. She was supposed to visit her native country this month with her 18-month-old daughter in tow. She's since had to cancel those plans.  Over the last week, Dufren has participated in rallies in New Orleans, which brought her a sense of comfort during this horrific time.  "We had an organized and peaceful gathering in New Orleans. Many people from all over the state and even from other states drove in to support with us which was great. I didn’t know we had so many Ukrainian people in my area. It was great to see our community come together and connect with others from my country," she said.

Dufren, who first spoke to Fox News Digital on February 25 amid tears, said it's also warmed her heart to see celebrities use their public platforms for good to help citizens of her native country.  "I am very happy to see celebrities supporting Ukraine. I am very happy to see how much money has been raised, and how involved and united everyone has come to support the people of my country," she said, adding, "We are also doing whatever we can to help support."

My sister called me and said she tried to go to the supermarket, but there's not enough food anymore," she said at the time.  Fortunately, Dufren said, her family lives near the border of Hungary and has not been close to the explosions. Still, one of her biggest fears is that her nephew could be called to join the military.  "My sister has a child. He's almost 18. He's at the age where they can take him to join the army. He's a kid. He doesn't know how to protect himself. He will not survive over there. It's my biggest fear that they will come and take him," she said last month.

We should be living a normal life. Normal people shouldn't die for money and land. This is ridiculous," she said.

The NHL on Monday suspended its agreement with the Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in the latest move for sports organizations to distance themselves from the Kremlin amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine.  The NHL told its teams to cease contact with KHL counterparts and Russia-based agents as part of the suspension of the memorandum between the professional hockey leagues, according to the Associated Press. Teams can continue to communicate with North American agents certified by the NHL Players’ Association but may have a higher degree of difficulty in completing agreements.

The Daily Faceoff first reported the NHL’s decision to cut ties with the KHL.  The NHL said last week it was suspending relationships with business partners in Russia and pausing Russian-language social and digital media sites, including terminating the NHL’s Russian broadcast agreement.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The National Hockey League condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and urges a peaceful resolution as quickly as possible," the league said last month. "Effective immediately, we are suspending our relationships with our business partners in Russia and we are pausing our Russian language social and digital media sites. In addition, we are discontinuing any consideration of Russia as a location for any future competitions involving the NHL.

We understand they and their families are being placed in an extremely difficult position."  NHL players from Russia and Belarus are facing an immense amount of harassment since the attacks on Ukraine began last week, and several of them have even received death threats, according to one agent who is asking people to "stop looking at them as aggressors."  Dan Milstein, a Ukrainian-born agent who represents the majority of those athletes being targeted in the league, told ESPN this week his clients have become concerned for their safety as they face increasing harassment.  "The discrimination and racism these Russian and Belarusian players are facing right now is remarkable," Milstein told the outlet. "We're being set back 30 years. I have players calling me, parents calling me. They're concerned whether they'll be able to play, whether they'll be safe."  He told the outlet some of his clients have received death threats, adding that he was recently targeted by someone on the street who called him a "Nazi" and was urged to "get back to your country."

As the Russia-Ukraine War escalates, cable news ratings have skyrocketed. But look at what they’re showing you: Social media posts and online influencers.  There's no question the Ukraine invasion is a social media war — the world's first. Many TV interviews are with Ukrainians who are garnering large social media followings. TikTok is filled with video clips of after bombing scenes and bomb shelters. They are shot on smartphones by citizens and shared directly with the world, bypassing traditional media outlets.  Here at home, my connections in the cybersecurity world say cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated and will target businesses and ordinary citizens like you and me. Tap or click here for five things you need to update right now, starting with your router .  Among genuine posts and videos you’re bound to run into fakes, old footage, and misleading information. Here’s how to spot the junk, so you don't unwittingly share it.  Have a critical eye  Sharing is always one click away on social media. Not many people take the time to research before spreading an article, photo, or video — especially when it comes from a friend or online personality you trust.  Russia's propaganda machine is operating at full throttle. Using artificial intelligence, Russia is creating fake accounts of Ukrainians who supposedly agree with the invasion of their country on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, and Twitter.  These accounts say Ukraine is a "failed state," and President Volodymyr Zelensky is "building a neo-Nazi dictatorship." The accounts often say the person works for a news organization or represents some political movement in Ukraine to build credibility.  Want to see an example? Meet Vladimir Bondarenko.  NBC News Senior Reporter Brian Collins discovered Vladimir Bondarenko and posted about him that, "He’s a blogger from Kiev who really hates the Ukrainian government. He also doesn’t exist, according to Facebook. He’s an invention of a Russian troll farm targeting Ukraine. His face was made by AI."  If you look closely at Vladimir Bondarenko’s face, there appears to be a piece missing out of the top of his left ear. That’s the problem with AI. It often misses the details.  Have you ever looked at an image and had an eerie feeling that something was off? Listen to your intuition.  Are there landmarks or notable buildings in a photo? What time of year is it? Can you see any clocks or other indicators of time?  It’s not just repurposed photos, either. Today’s deepfake technology makes it relatively easy to fake just about anything. Tap or click for 10 Russia-Ukraine war scams and cons spreading right now .  Find the first use  Old images and videos tend to go viral during a conflict, natural disaster, or emergency. Following the Russian invasion into Ukraine, a video of a dramatic explosion was shared tens of thousands of times. The footage was actual, but it showed the 2020 blast in Beirut.  There are a few tools that can help you spot recycled content. Start with Google Images.  You can search the internet using an image instead of words. When you run a photo through Google Images, it will search and find other images like it so you can determine the photo’s origin. It will also pull up modified and amended versions.  To search for an image, you can:  Drag the image to the Google Images search field .  . Copy the image’s URL and paste it into the search engine.  Right-click on any image in Chrome and hit "Search Google for image."  TinEye.com is another reverse image search option . Photos are checked against its in-house index, containing over 52.6 billion images.  Pro Tip: Are you usually scrolling social media or news sites on your phone?

Go on a fact-finding mission  Whether you’re looking at photos, videos, or just text, the more facts you know, the harder you are to fool. Where should you start? Many news organizations are dedicating resources to debunking phony viral content. Here’s a list of fact checks done by the Associated Press .  Independent groups are doing the same.

Metadata tells a story, too  Not everyone who posts photos or videos online realizes those files contain a lot of identifying information. Are you giving away more than you realize? Tap or click to see how you can sleuth out details in your own photos or photos saved to your computer or phone .  If you run across a photo and want to know where it came from or when it was shot, use an online tool to examine the metadata. Try exifdata or metapicz to see if you can turn up any interesting information. You can look at metadata using editing software like Photoshop, too.  One thing to note is that social media sites often strip out metadata to protect user privacy. Unless a photo is shared with you directly or through a messaging app, you may have more luck using Google Images or TinEye.  Report false and misleading posts when you see them  If you come across fake images or misleading posts, report them. Whether that’s Facebook or a reputable news site, take the time to point out that the information is incorrect.  With fake images comes false information, and that can cause serious problems.

Between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing cyberattacks, experts are warning about malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S., and some U.S. security pros spoke to Fox News about how to defend against technological assaults.  Russia is not likely to take President Biden’s new sanctions sitting down and has proven to be highly adept at cyber warfare, which has become part and parcel of active "kinetic" wars in the 21st century.  "This is not something to take lightly — cyber attacks don’t have borders," Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a tweet.  "I remain particularly concerned about the reports of cyber attacks…There’s historical precedent to suggest these could be devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire countries," Warner said in another tweet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russia has already launched what appears to be a series of cyberattacks on targets in the Ukraine. This past week, cyberattacks impacted the websites of several Ukrainian government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, according to Ukrainian officials. This follows cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites and banks that have been attributed to the Russian military spy agency GRU.  How to defend yourself from Russian cyber warfare ‘spillover’  As Sen. Warner suggested, cyberattacks don’t have borders. As a result, cyber spillover campaigns could reach the U.S.  "With the Ukraine conflict now front and center and poised to widen, we expect a surge of cybersecurity attacks from Russia state-sponsored organizations," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, told Fox News in a written statement.  Here’s what to watch out for and how to defend yourself, according to cybersecurity experts that Fox News spoke with.  --Ransomware: The bane of InfoSec professionals, ransomware attacks lock out companies and individuals from critical data. Attackers then demand hefty payments. "Businesses across the U.S. should be bracing for a variety of cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware," said John Dickson, vice president at Coalfire, a Westminster, Colorado-based provider of cybersecurity advisory services.  "Make sure that all critical and all internet-facing systems are fully patched to mitigate ransomware and data destruction," Lou Steinberg, cyber expert and founder of CTM Insights, told Fox News. "Use multi-factor authentication to log in to critical systems … and to prevent unauthorized changes (like turning off power or opening a valve on a dam)," Steinberg said.  --Denial of service attacks: Denial of Service, which renders critical computer services unavailable, and ransomware attacks are often "outsourced," according Steinberg. "Rather than the government directly performing them, they tend to be done by groups who believe they are being patriots by defending Russia's interests. It’s in [that] government's interest to enable this as it gives them deniability. You can’t trace an attack back to the Kremlin," Steinberg explained.  These outsourced actors "may be less capable" so companies can protect themselves if they take prudent cybersecurity measures, according to Steinberg.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: UKRAINE TO GET $350M MORE IN US DEFENSE AID: BLINKEN  --Social engineering campaigns: These attacks manipulate human behavior and "piggyback off of the news cycle," said Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions, at Lookout, a San Francisco, Calif.-based endpoint-to-cloud security company.  "Be especially vigilant about where you’re sharing data, who has access to it and the identity of anyone with whom you have interactions online," Schless said.  --Passwords: Consumers should always use multi-factor authentication and avoid reusing the same password across accounts/services, Alex Ondrick, director of security operations at BreachQuest, an Augusta, Georgia-based incident response company, told Fox News.  Ondrick said consumers can use sites like haveibeenpwned to see if they’ve been impacted by a security breach. "Regularly rotate passwords, especially on email/social media accounts, and for Wi-Fi and home router(s)," Ondrick said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  --Banking apps: "Consumers should be on the lookout for phishing and malware attacks, especially when accessing banking apps," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said. Consumers should use antivirus products as well as software that protects their identities, Ives added.  --Software updates: For individuals, it is important to follow cybersecurity best practices. That includes "installing recommended software and app updates, backing up their data and exercising caution when clicking links in emails, social media posts and online articles," Jonathan K. Osborne, a business litigation attorney at the Florida-based Gunster law firm, told Fox News.  --FBI: The FBI has a Cyber Threat website with tips and preventative measures on everything from email compromise to phishing and ransomware.

As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.  The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.  "Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred," FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.  Shah tells FOX News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal. Several parodies of Tom Cruise and other actors exist online.  TOM CRUISE DEEPFAKES ON TIKTOK POINT TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REALISTIC PHONY VIDEOS  The FBI gets involved if the video violates any federal laws, like extortion or fraud. Shah gave FOX News example of the voice of a company executive being manipulated.  "The same inflection. The same accent, and they make a phone call and you can ask the employee as the CEO, to wire that money."  A similar situation happened in Hong Kong as part of an international heist that is still under investigation.  While the FBI won't specifically comment on deepfakes as part of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, other intelligence sources say they are on the lookout for altered videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key players.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I think we are just starting to see the tip of the iceberg on these," cyber expert Matthew Canham told Fox News of deepfakes.  Canham has a stern warning for the public.  "I think it's probably wise to check everything that you see," he said. "Probably the more emotionally provocative it is, the more important it is to confirm the sources."

Yael Eckstein, president and CEO of The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ), told Fox News Digital via an email exchange this weekend amid her latest trip to Europe that she "thought she had seen it all."  She elaborated, "I have worked in the humanitarian aid field for over 16 years. I thought I had seen it all. But in the past seven days," she added — referring to Russia's assault on Ukraine — "I have witnessed suffering and desperation that I have never seen in my lifetime."  Eckstein said that for her, "the most heartbreaking thing was seeing orphans whom The Fellowship supports [caught] in the middle of a war zone."  RUSSIA ATTACKS UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Amid that suffering and desperation, however, comes a dramatic story of planning, escape, care and — at least for now — a semblance of calm during the storm that is most of Ukraine right now. And it wouldn't have happened if not for the support, the prayers and the help of many people, including those who have donated to important charities over the years.  Rescue flight: Sunday, March 6  The Fellowship shared with Fox News Digital details of the successful rescue of about 100 children from Ukraine over the past few days — and the latest news about where they've landed.  UKRAINE MOTHER DESCRIBES RUSSIA'S ATTACKS AS ‘EVIL’  It all began in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, where a woman named Malcki Bukiat was running an orphanage for children from "socially challenged families," The Fellowship reported to Fox News Digital. Some of these children are orphans; others had parents who couldn't care for them. For the bulk of the year — from the age of 4 years old until age 17 — the students lived at the orphanage.  Yet when the war on Ukraine began, Bukiat "found herself responsible for the lives of the children at the orphanage," as well as for the children of two other Jewish families that lived together with the school community — plus her own five children.  Said Bukiat, "We knew the situation [was] very dangerous. We saw that it became even worse in the last day, before we left. We were theoretically ready to take the kids toward the border — but, practically, it was very complicated."  Awakening to the sound of explosions one morning at 5 a.m., Bukiat said she knew she had to evacuate the children immediately.  "When you have to organize a trip of nearly 60 children — not including [your own] children [and other children] — with their basic needs, their documents and the papers from families, and at the same time you have to try to keep them calm and mentally balanced, it is not easy," she said.  "It took us a couple of hours. We told the kids to take only the most important things: clothes, personal medicines. We prepared some food for the way, as we knew the way was going to be very long," she added. "And we left Zhytomyr, moving to the west, in [a] bus."  "The [children] were very scared and some of them cried" during the trip westward.  The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, along with Chabad, planned this rescue mission for these children. The group mapped out the route based on what they knew about the path and the terrain — and about the bombings that were going on in Ukraine.  A journey of hope — toward safety  Bukiat shared that during this bus trip, "it was very difficult to keep the children calm. They were not used to seeing tanks, military vehicles and soldiers. They were very scared and some of them cried," she said.  "They needed us to support them, and we had to convey calmness to protect them from trauma." The trip took 15 hours, Bukiat said.  "The traffic jam was endless. Thousands of people were trying to escape to the borders. People were out of gas, food and water," she said.  "Some of these [travelers] had been [on the road] for three days or more," she said, "hiding from bombs and rockets in the open areas because they couldn’t arrive [at proper] shelters."  She said that "in the gas station, each vehicle could buy only 10 liters of gas. Thank God, we had our gas tank full."  ADOPTIVE MOM SHARES MESSAGE FOR PUTIN: ‘UKRAINE IS UKRAINE! LET IT BE’  Throughout this rough journey, things were "not easy" for Bukiat, she said. She finally realized that she needed help. So "I gathered the elder children, ages 14-15, and I [told] them I needed them to take care of the little ones. Everybody got an important role, and they did a fantastic job. We declared that our slogan was ‘everybody for everybody,’ and the children acted according to this principle."  She said they drove through open areas, "and it was scary. We passed checkpoints, we met some other people and I could not always be sure if they were harmless or dangerous," she added.  "The [journey] was challenging. We prayed a lot."  Bukiat said the group then "finally arrived at the area of the [Carpathian] mountains, where Chabad members rented us a hotel. The first thing we needed" to do, she said, was "get some necessities — clothes, toothpaste, shampoo — all the different things that the kids [had left behind, at the orphanage]."  PRAYERS FOR UKRAINE: AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS SHARE FERVENT CONCERNS  After that, she said the adults created "a day program that was the closest we could do to the one they were used to. The best way to calm the children," she said wisely, "was to bring them back to their routine."  Bukiat said that on Sunday, however, she "began to feel that the situation [had become even] worse than before. We heard more explosions and people who came to the hotel told us that this area wasn't safe anymore. We decided that there was no choice — we [had] to take the kids to the other side of the border."  The group made its way to Romania, across the border — and Bukiat reported that there, all the children were "safe." From that point, the group prepared to fly to Israel.  UKRAINE'S ORPHANS ARE TOP OF MIND FOR ADOPTIVE DAD AND HIS ORGANIZATION  Bukiat shared this important note about the treacherous trip: "You know, I didn’t [see] any difference between my own biological children and the schoolchildren. We were raised on the Jewish brotherhood principle — every Jew is precious to me. You ask me if I was scared at some point. Yes, I was, of course."  Yet "I am a believing woman," she added. "And, you know, you can believe in God and you can fully trust God." She said she fully "trusted God" and said she felt that "everything [would] be all right."  Final leg to Israel  "These innocent children endured days of fear and treacherous travel," said members of The Fellowship. The groups worked nonstop for days preparing for the trip.  "I shed tears of joy when I heard they crossed the border out of Ukraine," said Yael Eckstein.  On Sunday, March 6, the children finally arrived in Israel, via several flights. The trip was a joint operation by Israel’s Aliyah and Absorption Ministry, the Jewish Agency, and The Fellowship, the latter group explained.  The Fellowship also told Fox News Digital that it worked tirelessly with government officials to ensure that the children had the travel documentation necessary for the trip.  Upon arrival, they were greeted by The Fellowship's Eckstein — as well as by Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.  EVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLE TO STAY ALIVE, ARE GRATEFUL FOR HELP, PRAYERS  The orphans will be staying, for now at least, at a school campus in Israel. The Fellowship team is providing "immediate temporary housing and aid for their basic essentials," the group said.  In total, approximately 300 immigrants made it safely to Israel as part of this overall operation.  "Thank God that generous friends, especially Christians, had already provided over $3 million to help Ukraine's Jews over the last week," Eckstein told Fox News Digital earlier.  "We are so grateful they've helped us help them — but we're going to need more."  ‘Blessed to be able to bring them home'  Eckstein also told Fox News Digital, "I followed their evacuation closely from Israel, with anticipation and prayer.

The 40 days of this year's Lenten season started this past week, on Ash Wednesday, as Christian faithful all over the world began the spiritual commemoration of the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert, when he was repeatedly tempted by Satan.  "This year, the wisdom and cautions of Lent are heightened by the violence and uncertainty coming from Ukraine."  Referencing those 40 days spent in prayer and preparation by Jesus ahead of his public ministry, Fr. Jeffrey Kirby, a priest at Our Lady of Grace Parish in Indian Land, South Carolina, told Fox News Digital that Christians should use this period of time to work on their own spiritual renewal.  ASH WEDNESDAY, START OF LENT: WHEN ‘WORLD IS A MESS, WE MUST TURN TO GOD’  They can do this through "prayer, fasting and almsgiving," said Kirby.  The first Sunday in Lent is also called Quadragesima Sunday, which is derived from the Latin words meaning "fortieth," as this first Sunday is exactly 40 days before Easter.  There are six Sundays in all in Lent, including Palm Sunday.  LENT: WHAT IS IT AND WHY DO WE OBSERVE IT?  The observance of Lent in its entirety keeps the eyes of the faithful on God and on his promises contained in the Bible, said Fr. Kirby, author of the new book, "Glory Unto Glory: A Primer on Ascetical Theology."  "What will we do with the gift of life?"  "On Ash Wednesday, the stark reminder was given that we are dust and unto dust we shall return," he said.  This thought reminds each of us that life itself "hangs in the balance," and that throughout the entire Lenten season we're urged to "repent and believe in the Gospel."  Our lives today are "juxtaposed" between our birth and our death, he said.  "What will we do with the gift of life? How will our lives contribute to what Saint Paul called ‘the more excellent way of love'?"  Fr. Kirby said that the death and suffering we see in the continuing war in Ukraine should serve as sobering reminders of the reality of evil and sin.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY’  "This year, both the wisdom and cautions of Lent are heightened by the violence and uncertainty coming from Ukraine," he noted.  "As a sovereign nation is invaded and fights for its very existence, we see the tragedy of sin and darkness play itself out in our fallen world."  Saying that good people are shocked and dazed by the reality of what is happening in Ukraine, Kirby noted that peace has been "shattered" by a cruel "will to power."  POPE FRANCIS CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO END RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT  "Tranquility has been overturned by raw aggression," he said.  The "calm of life" has been overtaken by "unprovoked brutalism."  Kirby explained that "dark spirits … expose the fallenness of our world and remind Christians, and all people of good will, of the tragic consequences of humanity’s capacity for sin and destruction."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: KENTUCKY MOM OF 8 DESPERATE TO RESCUE TEEN GIRL  We can observe the first Sunday of Lent by looking inward as we pray for peace during these frightening and uncertain times, Fr. Kirby noted.

The national average for a gallon of gasoline jumped above $4 on Monday and is on the verge of breaking the all-time record of $4.11 set in 2008 sometime this week as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The increase has some recent truck and performance vehicle buyers lamenting their purchasing choices on social media, as often happens during price spikes.  Aside from heavy duty trucks, which don't have to display their fuel economy ratings, we've rounded up a list of the least-efficient vehicles currently offered by the American brands, based on their EPA combined fuel economy ratings, for those of you who are concerned things aren't going to change for a long time to come.  With its 668 hp supercharged V8, the high-performance Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing sedan is the most powerful vehicle Caddy has ever sold, but its efficiency is a throwback to the boulevardiers the brand sold in the 1970s.  Fat tires, compromised aerodynamics and a 797 hp supercharged V8 conspire to make Dodge's ultimate muscle cars drink fuel about as quickly as they accelerate.  The 450 hp 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 in the F-150 Raptor may be from Ford's EcoBoost family of engines, but the monster truck is not economical at the pump.  The rebooted Grand Wagoneer may not be available with wood paneling, but the fuel economy provided by its 6.4-liter V8 is very old fashioned.  Be careful what you wish for. Jeep Wrangler fans had been asking the brand to offer a V8-powered model for years and finally got one last year with a 470 hp V8 that takes the already inefficient SUV down to new lows.  The 760 hp Mustang Shelby GT500 is the most powerful Ford ever and burns gas as well as it burns rubber.

Haas F1 owner Gene Haas said his team fired its Russian driver Nikita Mazepin because of the broad issues his inclusion was causing for the team, despite Russians and Belarusians being allowed to compete in international Motorsports under the FIA flag, according to a ruling by the governing body last week.  Mazepin's contract was terminated last week along with that of the team's title sponsor, Uralkali, a Russia-based fertilizer company owned by his father, Dmitry.  "There was a lot of intense criticism about the Ukrainian invasion and it was just getting overwhelming. We can't deal with all that, our other sponsors can't deal with all that," Haas told The Associated Press on the starting grid of the NASCAR race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sunday. Haas also co-owns the Stewart-Haas NASCAR team.  Haas F1 is primarily funded by Haas Automation, a CNC machine tool company owned by Haas, and its cars will revert to the company's white, red and black color scheme for the Formula One test sessions in Bahrain this week, dropping the white, blue and red colors of the Russian flag they wore last year and at a test in Barcelona in February.  The team's reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi will drive Mazepin's car at the Bahrain test, but the team hasn't decided who will fill the seat during the season, which kicks off at the same track next week. Mick Schumacher of Germany drives Haas F1's second car.  "We're in the process of looking at several candidates, we'll see who is available and what we have to deal with," Haas said.  Haas hasn't announced a replacement for Uralkali but considers the team a marketing expense for Haas Automation and is prepared to run it at a large deficit.

The post continues, "Both Hickory and American shad are anadromous species that spend most of their life in the Atlantic Ocean, and then return to their natal rivers to spawn once they reach sexual maturity.

La Maison de la Poutine, which has locations in Paris and Toulouse, posted a statement on social media last week saying that it has received "calls of insults and even threats" over its name, according to a translation of the French statement.  Though the name may sound similar to the Russian president, poutine has no actual connection Putin. Poutine, which originated in Canada, is made of French fries, cheese curds and gravy.

"We know that they don't deserve what is happening to them and hope, and pray, that they can be courageous, but also remain safe during this time," Pipko told Fox News Digital in an interview.

The Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant winner this year is a St. George local, and she was not the only Utahn to shine at this year’s competition in Las Vegas.  Marianne Hamilton has been involved in the Southern Utah community for more than 10 years, leaving her mark on several organizations, the Spectrum newspaper reported. Since moving here from Northern California in 2014, Marianne and her husband Doug have become heavily involved in the Huntsman World Senior Games. Marianne discovered her love of athletics through participating and being a race director over the years.  It was her involvement with the Huntsman World Senior Games that led to her competing in the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant in 2019.  MISS AMERICA PAGEANT TURNS 100 YEARS OLD  "We were at nationals and this woman was greeting the athletes, and she was wearing a gown and her sash said Ms. Senior Utah, and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting.’ So I talked to her just real briefly," Hamilton said. "And then I ran into her again ... at another Senior Games event here. And we talked more, and she explained to me about senior pageantry and how it empowers women over 60 to still be out there and still give back to their community."  After looking into the website and speaking with the pageant director, Hamilton decided to compete in 2019.  Hamilton was diagnosed with breast cancer during her time between the 2019 and 2020 pageants.  It was an experience unlike anything she had previously had, but Hamilton said there were similarities between the senior athletic competitions and the senior pageantry. Both competitions focus on accomplishments in older people.  WOMAN DROPS 112 POUNDS, WINS BEAUTY PAGEANT AFTER FIANCÉ DUMPED HER FOR BEING TOO FAT  "I see very, very similar parallels between the Senior Games and being in the Senior Universe Pageant. And I think both are about a refusal to accept that age dictates boundaries," Hamilton said.  The Ms. Senior Universe Pageant focuses on competitors’ ability to show their accomplishments and how they portray themselves. There is no bathing suit competition. Instead, there are several days of questions and other ways for competitors to distinguish themselves.  One thing Hamilton excelled at was the writing portion of the competition. She is a journalist for St. George Health & Wellness Magazine and the St. George City Lifestyle Magazine.  "There was a lot of writing involved, which was kind of to my strengths, which was nice," Hamilton said. "You have to write several times; I had to write introductions for the judges to read. And you need to write out your philosophy of life and be able to recite that from memory within 30 seconds. There are a lot of photographs to gather and a lot of reflections about your life."

"It’s really thinking about the fact that whatever age you are, you deserve to be celebrated," Hamilton said. "And the more years you have on Earth, the more cumulative experience as you bring to the party."  Hamilton said that when she started she wasn’t expecting to get breast cancer in between competitions, but she learned from the experience.  "I’m here to tell you that it’s not a death sentence," she said. "And those kinds of things all go into making you a stronger person, and maybe able to help other people who are going through it."

According to the WHO, Polio hasn't been detected in Israel since 1988 — around the time authorities launched a massive vaccination campaign.  WHITE HOUSE SAYS COVID-19 MONEY ON ‘EMPTY’ AS IT TIES APPROVAL TO UKRAINE AID  Israel administers polio vaccines in four doses to children between the ages of 2 months old to around 7 years old, the Israel-based paper reported.  Despite showing symptoms of paralysis, the child has not been hospitalized, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Traces of the virus have been found in sewage samples in the area in the past without resulting in any clinical cases, the ministry noted.  Polio typically enters the body through the mouth, and spreads through contact with the feces of an infected person, or from droplets from a sneeze or cough, the CDC says.

Can springing forward cause problems for your ticker? Switching to daylight saving time may cause more than losing an hour of sleep; it may also have a negative impact on your heart and brain health, according to several studies.  The American Heart Association said several scientific reports suggest the upcoming time change is associated with an increase in the incidence of heart disease and stroke during the spring ahead time transition.  The "spring forward" to daylight saving time involves setting clocks forward one hour from standard time as we transition to summer months. The purpose is to extend natural daylight however; many scientific studies report this practice has significant impacts on one’s health in the days following this time transition.  DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME NEEDS TO BE ABOLISHED - LET'S STOP THE INSANITY  "We don’t really know the specific reason for increases in heart disease and stroke during the daylight saving time change, but it likely has something to do with the disruption to the body's internal clock, or its circadian rhythm," American Heart Association President Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, M.D., Sc.M., FAHA, and chair of the department of preventive medicine, the Eileen M. Foell Professor of Heart Research, said in the American Heart Association report.  The American Heart Association cited several studies demonstrating the detrimental health affects this one-hour loss of sleep potentially creates. One Michigan study found that the Monday following the ‘spring forward’ time change was associated with a 24 percent increase in daily heart attack incidents. The Michigan study authors noted that conversely, there was a 21 percent reduction in heart attacks on the Tuesday following the fall time change where one gains an hour of sleep.  Another study in Finland found the rate of ischemic stroke was 8 percent higher during the first two days after a daylight saving time transition, and a report in New York found hospital admission rates for atrial fibrillation, a common type of irregular heartbeat, also rose the days following the springtime change.  Dr. Fred Davis, Associate Chair of Emergency Medicine at Northwell Health on Long Island, New York, discussed the report with Fox News and said, "Sleep is important to our health and some studies around daylight saving time have highlighted this." The studies show increased numbers of heart attacks and strokes as we "spring forward," the emergency medicine physician told Fox News, about another danger associated with the time change. "We have seen increased motor vehicle accidents during these time changes, which can be due to alterations in one’s circadian rhythm that can lead to impaired focus and judgment," Davis told Fox News.  DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME: WHEN AND WHY WE ‘FALL BACK’  Lloyd-Jones, who is also a professor of preventive medicine, medicine and pediatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago also, said in the American Heart Association report, "If you are already at risk for cardiovascular disease, the time change could be even more risky. It’s important to work on improving your health risk factors all year long, and there are some specific steps you can take to prepare for the impact of ‘springing forward’ each spring."  This year daylight saving time is Sunday, March 13th, and experts at the American Heart Association offered these tips to prepare for the time change transition:  Start getting as much light as possible each day now. This can help adjust your body rhythm for the upcoming change.  This can help adjust your body rhythm for the upcoming change. Start winding down a little earlier in the evenings ahead. While you can never make up lost sleep, going into the time change well rested can help.  While you can never make up lost sleep, going into the time change well rested can help. Don’t compensate with extra caffeine. It may feel like an extra coffee or two can help you through the mid-day slump, but too much caffeine is not heart healthy.  It may feel like an extra coffee or two can help you through the mid-day slump, but too much caffeine is not heart healthy. Don’t take a nap. Most people don’t get enough sleep at any time; adding a cat nap to your afternoon can make it even harder to sleep well that night.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Lloyd Jones also said in the report that the best way to prepare for the daylight saving time change is to make gradual improvements to your lifestyle throughout the year including: eating smart, getting exercise, monitoring cholesterol and blood pressure, and developing healthy sleep habits. "These healthy lifestyle behaviors won’t only soften the annual biological clock shock, they are proven ways to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, helping you live a longer, healthier life," Lloyd-Jones said in the report.

As Ukrainians flee their country from Russia’s military onslaught, they face the prospect of the invisible enemy – bacteria and viruses that capitalize on the overcrowded conditions brought on by the bloody invasion, according to the Washington Post.  "As we’ve seen in wars over the years, viruses and bacteria are happy to exploit those situations where human beings are put under pressure," said Máire Connolly, professor at the National University of Ireland Galway who studies the relationship between war and disease.  WHITE HOUSE SAYS COVID-19 MONEY ON ‘EMPTY’ AS IT TIES APPROVAL TO UKRAINE AID  "These factors increase the risk of outbreaks among a population that are already dealing with the trauma of forced displacement."  As the Russian offensive cuts off travel, Ukraine’s hospitals are running out of vital medical supplies. Healthcare workers relocate their patients to makeshift shelters as civilian casualties mount under the threat of an explosion at any moment’s notice, per the news outlet.  "What we’re dealing with now in Ukraine is a double crisis," Connolly added, also noting the war conditions are fodder not only for COVID-19, but also the ongoing Ukraine polio outbreak, which international experts have been trying to end for months.  She describes the often the paradoxical plight of refugees as they flee to safety only to end up in unsanitary and often unsafe conditions that are the perfect environments for an infectious disease outbreak, such as the reemergence of tuberculosis, the paper added.  Ukraine suffered some of the world’s worst rates of COVID-19 as neighboring European countries enjoyed some of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, creating the threat of a COVID-19 surge as thousands, potentially millions, of Ukrainians seek refuge into neighboring countries, per the Post.  "I am heartbroken and gravely concerned for the health of the people in Ukraine in the escalating crisis," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a recent statement.  He posted a video on Twitter of newborns in Ukraine in a makeshift bomb shelter that he called "beyond heartbreaking."  This past Sunday he warned the country is almost running on empty with oxygen supplies as US officials accuse the Russian military of firing on ambulances and hospitals.  "The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out," the WHO added.  Compounding the situation, experts warn the conflict may have also disturbed sensitive radioactive waste stored at the Chernobyl nuclear plant that could ignite another environmental disaster, according to the Post.  The paper added, however, international humanitarian organizations are rallying to provide emergency support, with the WHO providing $3.5 million in additional emergency funding, the U.S. Agency for International Development deploying a disaster response team to Poland, and together with the State Department, is providing nearly $54 million in additional assistance.  COVID-19 SPREAD DURING RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WORRIES WHO OFFICIALS  The White House has asked also for $6.4 billion in emergency aid with most going to humanitarian aid, according to the Post.  "Covid is understandably not top of mind for anyone [during war conditions]," Rachel Silverman, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, texted the Post from Germany.

The world is showing its support for Ukraine with the country’s national anthem as the Russia-Ukraine war reaches its first week.  Countless videos of people singing or playing the anthem’s tune with live instruments have been shared on social media as citizens of the world display defiance toward Russian aggression.  Peaceful protestors have sung the anthem at rallies and demonstrations in cities across the globe as have Ukrainians who’ve taken to the streets to fight or have found shelter while Russian Armed Forces continue their attacks.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The anthem has also been played at sporting events, concerts and other gatherings around the world, including a hockey game between the Glasgow Clan and Fife Flyers in Scotland, a Dmitri Shostakovich concert at Bozar Brussels – Centre for Fine Arts in Belgium and Ukrainian opera singer Yuriy Yurchuk in London.  Ukraine’s national anthem — "Shche ne Vmerla Ukrainyina," which reportedly translates to "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet," according to National Anthems Info — is based on a poem written by ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi in 1862.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  The song’s lyrics were taken directly from Chubynskyi’s poem, and it was later composed into an anthem by Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a Catholic priest, according to the national anthem resource.  National Anthems Info reports that "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet" was performed for the first time in 1864 at the Ukraine Theatre in Lviv. The song was a popular tune among high society, but it was discouraged when the Soviet Union took over Ukraine in 1920 following the Russian Empire’s fall.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  The song regained popularity during World War II and became an unofficial anthem in Western Ukraine. It eventually became Ukraine’s national anthem a little over four decades later when the country achieved its independence.  Ukraine became an independent nation on Aug. 24, 1991. The anthem was formally adopted in January 1992 by legislative officials in Ukraine’s parliament.  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  National Anthems Info reports that slight modifications to the anthem’s lyrics were made in 2003.  Translated lyrics for "Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet" published by Lyrics on Demand — an online song lyric database — describe Ukrainian resilience in face of adversity, which is expressed in seven rhythmic lines.  "Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,  Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.  Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,  And we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.  We'll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom  And we'll prove that we brothers are of Kozak kin  (repeat previous two lines)"  — Ukraine national anthem: ‘Ukraine is Not Dead Yet’ English translation by Lyrics on Demand  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022.

A mother’s love can’t be stopped, even when you’re at work.  That’s what multimedia journalist Myles Harris learned firsthand while he was on location for a story in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this week.  Standing across the street from a Roosters Wings restaurant on East Dublin-Granville Road while wearing his blue jacket from ABC 6, Harris tried to coordinate his shot with his videographer DeAngelo Byrd.  WEST VIRGINIA REPORTER HIT BY CAR WHILE ON AIR -- CONTINUES REPORTING  Harris’ mother, Sandi, slowly rolled up behind him in her car and stopped by to say hi, according to a video the local news reporter shared to Instagram on Sunday, Feb. 20.  "This is my mom, hold on," Harris tells his crew near the start of the 21-second clip.  Once Sandi is sure she has his attention after she stops her car, she calls out, "Hi baby!"  "I’m trying to work right now, and you’re over there calling my phone," Harris responds in acknowledgment that he notice her earlier.  "This is DeAngelo. You can say, ‘Hi.’" He continues. "And don’t be holding up traffic because you got cars behind you."  "Oh, alright," Sandi says before she blows a kiss and drives away.  WEST VIRGINIA REPORTER TELLS 'AMERICA'S NEWSROOM' SHE'S 'ALL GOOD' AFTER CAR STRUCK HER DURING LIVE REPORT  The moment earned a laugh from Harris’ followers, but it later went viral on Wednesday, Feb. 23, after the popular meme page Pubity uploaded the clip to its Twitter and Instagram accounts, which have more than 30.9 million followers combined.  Harris’ employer – the Sinclair Broadcast Group – caught on to the viral moment and shared the clip across the two local news stations he reports for – WSYX ABC 6 and FOX 28 Columbus.  The Sinclair Broadcast Group operates both stations to serve residents in northeast Columbus. Harris was actively reporting for ABC 6 when his mother stopped to greet him in the field. It’s not immediately clear if Harris was prepping for a live shot or a standup news video.  Fox News Digital reached out to Harris and ABC 6 for comment.

Graham says Antonov “is the mouthpiece for Putin, has no moral standing, and I hope to see him in The Hague one day.” Graham feels the solution lies with the Russian people and the sooner they can stop the menace in Russia, it will make the world a better place. Graham added, “I hope there’s a Russian spring in the making here.”

There are growing bipartisan calls in Congress to ban Russian oil imports in the U.S. as a way to cut off Vladimir Putin’s revenue stream. Dagen says the restrictions the Biden administration has placed on the U.S. energy sector over the past year have only hurt domestic oil and gas production and strengthened Putin.  “Well, that’s the problem is they’re invested in an ideology and not a reality of how people need and use cheap and plentiful fossil fuels. But also how, and I said this a year ago and it makes me insane, the day that Biden was inaugurated, I said by attacking our energy sector, which he did do by canceling Keystone XL, that was the beginning. I know that it hasn’t been finished yet. A lot of it wasn’t complete. I understand all of that. But it was representative of canceling leases, canceling drilling permits, trying to shut down the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and nominating people to positions of power who want to quote bankrupt the oil companies and starve them of funding. So that’s who they are. So on day one, I said, when you damage our energy economy, which raises our standard of living and also gives us power and prosperity on the world stage, you were handing power and wealth to nations that hate us, that want to wipe the United States off the map. You’re handing power and wealth to Vladimir Putin and to Iran. And I said it a year ago, and that’s exactly what happened.”  Plus, Co-Anchor of “America’s Newsroom” Bill Hemmer stops by to discuss the latest developments in Eastern Europe.

During his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Biden insisted we need to give law enforcement officers the training and resources they need to protect our communities. According to Leo, the President changed his tune because this issue is hurting the Democrats politically.  “What an embarrassment for Joe Biden to pull this last minute, try to save his party from a disastrous midterm to lie, I’m just going to be clear, to lie about the position of the Democratic Party, defund the police. This whole country knows that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Black Lives Matter, AOC, all of them have tried to not defund the police, destroy the police. Basically give the keys to every Democratic city to the criminals. So it was a disingenuous statement. He knows they’re in trouble, and he lied on national TV. The Democratic Party has been against supporting the police, against funding the police. It was a lie. And he had no problem doubling down on it.”  Leo also gives Jimmy a hard time for not being in New York City during his highly anticipated visit.  Later, Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn stops by to explain why the most effective way to cut off Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revenue stream is to make the U.S. energy independent.

Senator McConnell said he asked Judge Jackson her position on court-packing, but didn’t receive an answer saying,  “I did emphasize to her. I thought it was one thing she could safely address and people would welcome hearing. And that’s the same thing that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer said about court-packing. Both of whom made it clear that it was a bad idea and was an attack on the integrity of the court and its independence. I didn’t get an answer to that, but I’m sure she’ll be asked that again in her hearings before the Judiciary Committee.”  Full Transcript:  GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Well, joining us now is Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.  Senator, it’s great to have you on the show. Welcome back.  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Sure. Glad to be with you, Guy.  BENSON: Just your overall thoughts, you were in the chamber, of course, last night. The cameras were fixed on you a couple times. What were your initial reactions? You’ve now had, you know, almost a day to digest it a bit more. Your takeaways from the president last night?  MCCONNELL: On Ukraine, I think the tone was a little too self-congratulatory. I think we all know the inspiration is being provided by the courageous Ukrainian people and their incredible leader who are literally inspiring the rest of the world with their bravery and have produced, you know, clearly the total different reaction from NATO that — that Putin predicted.  I mean, who would have ever thought the Germans — I mean, even in a coalition that includes the Green Party, would completely reverse their policies over the last few decades not only on energy but also on the exportation of weapons directly to Ukraine, doubling their defense budget and saying they’re going to get to 2 percent of GDP as rapidly as possible. Who would have ever thought Finland and Sweden would be saying maybe we need to get in NATO? I think from a — from a NATO perspective, Putin has produced more unity and resolve than any of the previous administrations I can think of regardless of party.  BENSON: So that was the opening portion of the president’s speech on Ukraine and Russia. A lot of unity in the room, if a bit too self-congratulatory, to use your phrase. He then moved on to the rest of the speech that just kind of felt like a hodgepodge to me, where he was jumping from one topic to another pretty quickly, not a lot of transitions. And it didn’t feel fresh, or trying to turn over a new leaf, or turn the page on what has been a very tough first year for him as president. It was a lot of — more of the same. It felt like he was giving us maybe a little bit of a reminder tour of the greatest hits that weren’t able to pass Congress. Saying, well, why don’t you go pass the Democratic takeover of our elections and pass big elements of Build Back Better? I wonder what you think of that, given that that’s certainly not new and it seems almost quixotic given what’s already happened in recent months.  MCCONNELL: Yes, you know what I was thinking as I sat there and listened to that, Guy, was how Bill Clinton reacted when he got his butt handed to him in the ’94 election. This — the next State of the Union message started off by saying, incredibly, “The era of big government is over.” That’s my definition of a pivot. You know, Biden ran as a moderate. But he’s not been a moderate. And so and the — it was more of the same. The same old stuff they tried to pass last year they’re still advocating, nothing new there whatsoever. I think it was a lost opportunity for him to indicate he maybe heard the voices of the American people. They have been expressed, they were expressed in Virginia and in New Jersey. But I think the message was we’ll stay the course.  BENSON: By the way, speaking of Virginia there’s a new poll out this week of Virginia voters. And Glen Youngkin compared to President Biden has a net 22-point popularity advantage over President Biden in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He’s plus nine, the governor is, and the president is minus 12 on job approvals. So — and that’s in a blue state. So that helps sort of paint the picture of the national environment that this president is dealing with, that his party is dealing with. Last question on the State of the Union last night, Senator, it’s a two-parter. There’s been a fair amount of media attention to the backbencher House of Representatives member on the Republican side who, at one point, heckled the president about American deaths in Afghanistan. In your view, is that an appropriate thing to do, A? And then, B, what do you think of the president and his team’s decision not to even mention Afghanistan at all in those remarks which spanned 70 minutes?  MCCONNELL: Well, I guess the reason they didn’t want to mention Afghanistan is it was a debacle. I believe, Guy, that had we not precipitously abandoned Afghanistan, Vladimir Putin wouldn’t have gone into Ukraine. It was the perception of American withdrawal and weakness that emboldened thugs like Putin. But I’m not surprised that Joe Biden didn’t mention Afghanistan. It was, I think, a low point in an otherwise pretty botched up performance all year long.  BENSON: Any comment on the outburst from the Republican Congresswoman?  MCCONNELL: Look, I think civil behavior is a good idea in Congress. We act that way in the Senate. I don’t normally give the House advice. But it seems to me, a respectful response to the State of the Union would be the norm.  BENSON: Earlier today you had an opportunity to meet face-to-face with the new Supreme Court nominee from President Biden, Judge Brown Jackson of the D.C. Circuit, a highly anticipated meeting because of your position, of course, in the Senate, and it’s always all eyes on a Supreme Court vacancy. To the extent that you’re able to talk to us about your perceptions of the nominee, how that meeting went, we’d be very curious to hear.  MCCONNELL: Well, these nominees don’t say much. They’ve all been schooled going back to Ruth Bader Ginsburg not to really answer much of anything. But I think she’s an intelligent — very likely a progressive. The Senate Republican Minority intends to treat the nominee respectfully. I’m not at all interested, for example, in what somebody may have written in her high school yearbook. I did emphasize to her I thought it was one thing she could simply address, and people would welcome hearing, and that’s the same thing that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer said about court-packing, both of whom made it clear that was a bad idea and was attacked — an attack on the integrity of the — of the — of the court and its independence. I didn’t get an answer to that. But I’m sure she would be asked that again in her hearings before the Judiciary Committee.  BENSON: Setting aside her worldview, and I think if she makes it to the court, I think it’s likely that she’ll be confirmed given the math and the dynamics. I — I’ll probably end up disagreeing with much of her jurisprudence and her rulings over the course of her time on the court. But setting that aside, do you think at least in terms of her C.V. is she qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court?  MCCONNELL: Yes, yes. No question about that.  BENSON: Last question, Senator McConnell. There has been some reporting in D.C. about some backroom drama within the Senate Republican Conference over the NRSC Chairman this cycle, Rick Scott from Florida, putting out, sort of, an agenda that largely is popular with the American people. But there is one tax provision that would give Democrats an opening to attack Republicans. And there are reports that you have been critical of including that in this public agenda that he put out there and that there’s perhaps a bit of disagreement happening behind the scenes. I think Republican and conservative voters, who might like you and Senator Scott, without making it personal at all, they just feel like the Republican Party needs to not blow it this cycle. And there’s a huge opportunity to win and maybe even win big in the midterm elections. Can they be confident that this type of skirmish will be resolved relatively quickly, and the party is going to be focused and united heading into November?  MCCONNELL: Well, yes. I think so. I think it’s important to remember that this election is going to be a referendum on the performance of this entirely Democratic government. And it’s also important to the extent that we begin to talk about what a new Senate Republican majority would do, to make it clear that we’re not going to raise taxes and to make it clear that we’re not going to sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. Not only would that be a disastrous government policy, it would lead to having it fall — be a referendum on us rather than them.  BENSON: And if it’s just a referendum on them, based on some of the polling data that I just referenced a few minutes ago, I think it’d be, perhaps, a very rough night ahead for the Democratic Party in November. You predicted last time we spoke that Republicans are in the driver’s seat, House and Senate, for November. We’ll revisit that in the weeks and months to come as we have you back. Senator McConnell, always appreciate it. Thank you so much.  MCCONNELL: Thank you, Guy.  BENSON: And we’ll be right back after this.  END

During his 62-minute speech, the President touched on a variety of issues, including the situation in Ukraine, inflation, the American tax system, securing the Southern border, crime and COVID-19. Rep. Brady thinks Biden’s plan to fix inflation by lowering costs as opposed to wages does not make any sense.  “I think he’s just divorced from reality when it comes to the economy. And you know, if you’re a family worried about high prices, you’ve just given back three years of your gains that you got under President Trump, you heard nothing that’s going to help you lower those prices. If you’re a small businessperson struggling to find workers to keep your doors open, you heard nothing last night to address this. In fact, if anything, I think his obsession with Build Back Better, there’s no question that spending will drive up inflation. The tax hikes will end up in higher prices and be an economic surrender to Russia, to China, Europe and others. And so yeah, he’s just stuck on that. And I’ll be honest, he doesn’t understand the economy, just as when he and in President Obama were in office. That’s why my conclusion, just watching the speech, it just struck me. You know, all Americans, especially people of color, prospered in the economy under President Trump. All Americans, especially people of color, are suffering in the economy under President Biden.”  Later, Georgia Republican Congressman Drew Ferguson checks in and tells Jimmy why Biden’s energy policies are hurting our country, especially in light of the current war between Russia and Ukraine.
