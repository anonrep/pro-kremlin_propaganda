But when most of the world’s largest oil producers meet by teleconference on Thursday to discuss supplies, analysts don’t expect much action. Officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are likely to do little more than announce their usual modest monthly production increases, leading to questions about how much oil the group really does have in the tank.  Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are likely to lead to the loss of substantial quantities of both crude and oil products, especially diesel fuel, from the market. Already, major buyers of Russian oil, like Shell and TotalEnergies, have said they will gradually purge petroleum of Russian origin from their vast networks.  “These losses will be enduring as Russia will likely remain the most sanctioned country on earth for the foreseeable future,” wrote Helima Croft, head of commodities at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, in a note to clients on Wednesday.  Russia is one of the world’s top three oil producers, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, and exports about eight million barrels a day in crude and products. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based group, estimates that as much as three million barrels a day of Russian oil, or about 3 percent of world supplies, could soon be shut down in what “could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades.”  Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could produce substantially more crude “that could help offset a Russian shortfall,” the agency said in its latest oil market report.  Yet these countries — the de facto leader of OPEC and a key ally — don’t seem inclined to act, a stance that seems puzzling given their longstanding security and commercial links to the West.  Image Jennifer M. Granholm, the energy secretary, said, “The urgent need to accelerate the equitable transition to clean energy remains a top priority, and must be accelerated.” Credit... Mohammed Badra/EPA, via Shutterstock  “The wider question is: Do even they face some technical obstacles” to bringing large additional volumes of oil online? said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a research firm. Saudi Arabia says it has the ability to produce about 12.5 million barrels a day, more than two million barrels a day above recent output.  Certainly most members of a group of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC Plus, have already run out of firepower, as countries like Nigeria and Angola have been unable to keep up with recent targets. The group is likely to add only a small fraction of the output increase it announces Thursday, Mr. Bronze figures. Russia clearly won’t be able to increase production, because it is already running out of storage tanks for unsold oil.  Moreover, the group is approaching the end, later this year, of unwinding the steep production cuts of early 2020 that helped bolster the market when demand and prices plummeted in the early days of the pandemic.  The Saudis and the Emiratis may figure that, with prices gyrating and the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine far from clear, now is not the time to unleash what resources they have left. While events like the coronavirus lockdowns in China are probably reducing demand, oil consumption is still likely to be higher in the summer driving season and output may potentially be lower.  The fact that closing prices for Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, have swung in recent weeks from as high as nearly $130 a barrel to below $100 allows the group to argue, however unconvincingly, that geopolitics rather than shortfalls are adding a premium to the price and go on taking in huge volumes of cash.  “Current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals but by current geopolitical developments,” the group said after its last meeting on March 2.  In addition, the International Energy Agency is in the early stages of coordinating a 60-million-barrel release of oil, announced on March 1, from the reserves of the United States and about two dozen other countries. These additions to supply reduce the incentive for OPEC Plus to try to influence the markets, analysts say.  Also, OPEC Plus does not seem ready to act against the interests of Russia, a co-chair of the group, which presumably would oppose an additional increase in production that would help countries live without Russian crude.  Image An oil storage tank in Saudi Arabia, one of the few countries with the resources to substantially increase oil production. Credit... Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters  The United Arab Emirates, in particular, seems sympathetic to Russia’s concerns in the conflict with Ukraine and threatened by the prospect of democratic revolution that the Ukrainian government represents.  “There is an affinity for Russia and authoritarians in general” among the U.A.E.’s leaders, said Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a research organization in Washington.  OPEC Plus officials have also voiced frustration with being asked to solve what they view as problems created by poorly thought-out Western policies on climate change. OPEC officials say they are being asked to increase output while Western governments and investors are leaning on energy companies to cut investments in oil and gas to meet climate goals.  The argument among many producing countries in the Middle East is that painfully high oil and gas prices are the bitter fruit of trying to dispense with fossil fuels before sufficient alternative resources like wind and solar power are available.  “We cannot and must not unplug the current energy system before we have built a new one,” Sultan al Jaber, the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, said at a recent Atlantic Council conference.  Yet there is little sign that the West is backing off on moving away from oil and gas, especially from potentially unreliable suppliers like Russia. In fact, Moscow’s use of energy to put political pressure on European countries may prove to be an incentive for Western countries to reduce consumption of fossil fuels faster. Germany, for instance, is moving fast to sever energy ties with Moscow, which has long been its key supplier.  “The urgent need to accelerate the equitable transition to clean energy remains a top priority, and must be accelerated,” Jennifer M. Granholm, the U.S. energy secretary, said last week.  The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates have other reasons not to rush to comply with Western requests. They are worried about intensifying missile attacks on energy installations and other targets in their countries by the Yemeni-based Houthi group, and suggest that Washington is not doing enough to stop them.  Saudi Arabia recently warned that it would not be responsible if these incidents knocked out oil exports to the world. These countries are also skeptical of Washington’s efforts to restore the nuclear deal with Iran and, thus, allow Tehran to sell more oil. The Saudis blame Iran for supplying the Houthis with the missiles launched against them.  In the meantime, analysts say there is little reason to think that the current oil crunch won’t worsen as buyers shy away from Russian oil. “I am surprised at how low prices are,” said David Wech, chief economist at Vortexa, a data analytics firm.

Credit... Desiree Rios for The New York Times  As the coronavirus pandemic moves into what the White House hopes is a “new normal,” the Biden administration has introduced covid.gov, a federal website meant to help Americans who are infected with the virus find the treatment they need quickly and at no cost.  “This website is part of our effort — our continued and ongoing effort — to make sure that people have what they need to deal with Covid as we move into potentially the next phase of this disease,” the White House said on Wednesday.  This new phase, aimed at helping the United States transition to “living with the virus,” has four main goals: protecting against and treating Covid-19, preparing for new variants, avoiding shutdowns and fighting the virus abroad.  During his State of the Union address, President Biden promised to establish a “test-to-treat” program “so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.”  On the website, people can find the locations of vaccination and testing sites and places to acquire high-quality masks; fill out a form to order eight free at-home coronavirus tests per household; view their community’s risk level according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and get general information on Covid symptoms, treatment, testing and travel.  Much of this information, such as C.D.C. community risk levels and test order forms, was already available elsewhere, but this website is intended to make it more convenient to get coronavirus-related information and supplies all in one place, the White House said in a statement.  “We could not have done this six or eight months ago, because we didn’t have all the tools we have now,” Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in an interview with NPR.  The website is available in English, Spanish and Chinese. The administration is also making all of these tools available over the phone through the national vaccine hotline at 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489), which supports over 150 languages.  The White House also said that people can still be tested and treated by their own health care providers, who can prescribe Covid antivirals at locations where they are being distributed.  In the past two weeks, the United States has seen a 12 percent decrease in average daily cases, according to a New York Times database. In the same time period, hospitalizations have decreased by 33 percent and deaths have decreased by 44 percent.

Arijan Djan, a Belgrade-based psychotherapist, said she had been shocked by the lack of empathy among many Serbs for the suffering of Ukrainians but realized that many still bore the scars of past trauma that obliterated all feeling for the pain of others.  “Individuals who suffer traumas that they have never dealt with cannot feel empathy,” she said. Societies, like trauma-scarred individuals, she added, “just repeat the same stories of their own suffering over and over again,” a broken record that “deletes all responsibility” for what they have done to others.  A sense of victimhood runs deep in Serbia, viewing crimes committed by ethnic kin during the Balkan wars of the 1990s as a defensive response to suffering visited on Serbs, just as Mr. Putin presents his bloody invasion of Ukraine as a righteous effort to protect persecuted ethnic Russians who belong in “Russky mir,” or the “Russian world.”  “Putin’s ‘Russian world’ is an exact copy of what our nationalists call Greater Serbia,” said Bosko Jaksic, a pro-Western newspaper columnist. Both, he added, feed on partly remembered histories of past injustice and erased memories of their own sins.

Belying its claims of de-escalation, Russia increased bomb and artillery attacks in Ukraine on Wednesday and sent conflicting signals about the prospects for peace, suggesting new tensions in the Kremlin hierarchy about the course of the war.  The contradictory messaging came as a newly declassified U.S. intelligence assessment suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had been misinformed about the war’s trajectory by subordinates, who were fearful of his reaction to the Russian military’s struggles and setbacks.  The intelligence, according to multiple American officials, showed Mr. Putin’s isolation and what appeared to be growing tension between him and the Ministry of Defense, including with his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin inner circle and had been rumored to be a possible successor one day to Mr. Putin.  It was not clear whether the release of the declassified intelligence was intended to sow anxiety within Mr. Putin’s circle as part of a broader information battle between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, the source of the worst tensions between the two nuclear powers since the Cold War. Nor was it clear if the intelligence was accurate.  But American intelligence officials have proved right so far in their assessments of Mr. Putin’s intentions toward Ukraine, beginning with the Russian troop buildup along its borders last year that culminated in the Feb. 24 invasion.  White House officials said that they had released the intelligence to share what they said was a “full understanding” of how Mr. Putin had miscalculated.  Image Ukrainian soldiers inspecting a disabled Russian armored vehicle on Tuesday in Irpin. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times  “We believe he’s being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, told reporters.  Asked about the declassified assessment during a trip to Algiers, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said it was not surprising that Mr. Putin was ill-informed.  “One of the Achilles’ heels of autocracies,” he said, “is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power. And I think that is something that we’re seeing in Russia.”  The latest assessment also appeared to track with the mixed messages from the Kremlin on Wednesday about peace talks with Ukraine this week in Istanbul. The chief Russian negotiator described them as promising, but was basically contradicted by the Kremlin’s top spokesman.  New Russian attacks in Ukraine, on the northern city of Chernihiv and the suburbs of Kyiv, also appeared to reflect disarray in Kremlin messaging, coming one day after the Russian military said it was de-escalating in those areas. They suggested that Mr. Putin might be stalling for time, redeploying his invasion forces elsewhere in the country and girding for a protracted conflict.  Mr. Putin’s ultimate aim, however, remains murky.  With the war about to enter its sixth week, its calamitous economic and humanitarian impact has widened. Germany has taken the first steps toward rationing natural gas, in anticipation of Russia potentially cutting off deliveries; the total number of Ukrainian refugees has surpassed four million — half of them children; and the United Nations is forecasting the most dire world hunger crisis since World War II. Ukraine and Russia are ordinarily major suppliers of the world’s wheat and other grains.  The Chernihiv region, which extends to the border with Belarus, appeared to have been targeted with intense Russian strikes early Wednesday, hours after Russia had vowed to sharply reduce combat in that area and near Kyiv. Both were early targets of the Russian invaders, who were stymied by intense and unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance.

Nataliia Dubrovska/EPA, via Shutterstock  “Yesterday, the Russians publicly stated that they were reducing their offensive actions and activity in the Chernihiv and Kyiv areas,” the Chernihiv governor, Vyacheslav Chaus, said in a statement posted on the Telegram social media app. “Do we believe that? Of course not.”  Mr. Chaus said that “civil infrastructure has been destroyed again” by Russian strikes. “Libraries, shopping malls and other facilities have been destroyed, and many houses have been destroyed,” he said. “Because, in fact, the enemy roamed Chernihiv all night.”  In Kyiv, the regional military administration said in a Wednesday post on its Telegram channel that “more than 30 shellings by Russian troops of housing estates and social infrastructure” in the Kyiv region had been recorded over the previous 24 hours.  The mixed messaging from Russia on Wednesday raised questions about whether progress in the peace talks was real.  Image Damage in Irpin on Tuesday. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times  The lead Russian negotiator in the talks, Vladimir Medinsky, said on Russia’s state television that they appeared to be verging on a breakthrough. Mr. Medinsky said Ukraine’s proposal to declare neutrality, among what he called other concessions, represented its readiness for “building normal and, I hope, good neighborly relations with Russia.”  That language clashed markedly with hard-line rhetoric emanating from Moscow, where supporters of the war, who do not consider Ukraine to be a legitimate country, denounced Mr. Medinsky’s diplomacy as bordering on traitorous.  “Any talks with Nazis before your boot is on their throat are perceived as weakness,” Vladimir Solovyov, a popular state television host, said on his YouTube show, reprising the Kremlin’s false characterization of the Ukrainian government. “You cannot meet with them or talk to them.”  And the Kremlin’s chief spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, was far more cautious in his own comments than Mr. Medinsky. He said that Ukraine’s willingness to put some proposals in writing was a “positive factor,” but that “we do not see anything very promising or any breakthroughs.”  Image President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times  Russia first signaled last week that it was recalibrating the aims of what Mr. Putin has described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine, no longer focusing on seizing Kyiv and other important cities in the north and west of the country but instead on securing the eastern region, known as the Donbas. Russian-backed separatists have been fighting there since 2014.  The Russian Defense Ministry has cast its decision to wind down military operations around Kyiv as a good-faith gesture of de-escalation, but it appeared to be an attempt to explain away a battlefield defeat.  On Wednesday, the ministry said Russian forces around Kyiv were “regrouping,” although that assertion could not be independently confirmed. And it claimed that all along, the aim of gathering forces near Kyiv had not been to take the city but to tie up and weaken Ukrainian troops in the area.  “All these goals were achieved,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it would now focus on “the final stage of the operation to liberate” the Donbas area.  The secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Wednesday that at least part of the Russian military’s assertions appeared to be accurate. Some Russian units were relocating to eastern Ukraine and “the enemy is intensifying its formations there,” he said.  But Mr. Danilov cautioned that it would be premature to conclude that Russia had abandoned a push toward the capital, even if it was relocating some troops.  In the Donetsk part of Donbas, fighting escalated on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said in a statement, as Russian forces “intensified fire and assault operations” with air and missile strikes. Ukraine’s military also reported Russian shelling and bomb strikes in the eastern city of Kharkiv, one of the invasion’s early targets.  Image A Ukrainian soldier adjusting a comrade’s magazine carrier before a patrol Tuesday in Kyiv. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times  Casualties in the war are difficult to confirm. The United Nations, which keeps a daily tally, said Wednesday that at least 1,189 people had been killed so far, although that is almost certainly an undercount.  The possible legal consequences for Russia over its targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine — a potential war crime — moved forward on Wednesday with the formation of a United Nations panel of inquiry. The three-person panel, named by the U.N. Human Rights Council, will “establish the facts, circumstances and root causes” of any crimes arising from the invasion, the council said.  Amid the litany of negative news, there was one potential bright spot: A NASA astronaut returned to Earth on Wednesday with two Russian colleagues, suggesting that despite their antipathy over the crisis in Ukraine, the United States and Russia could still collaborate in space.

Mr. Biden could announce the plan to tap the reserve as soon as Thursday, said the official, who requested anonymity because the plan was not ready to be announced Wednesday night. The idea would be to combat rising prices at the pump.  The president’s public schedule, which was released Wednesday night, said he would deliver remarks Thursday afternoon on the administration’s “actions to reduce the impact of Putin’s price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families,” a reference to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.  The price of West Texas Intermediate, the American crude oil benchmark, fell about 4 percent late Wednesday evening after the plan was reported, by Bloomberg News. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, was similarly down, about 3.5 percent.

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.63 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.  Tracking vaccination rates by country Charts show countries with at least 100,000 people  Less wealthy countries are relying on a vaccine-sharing arrangement called Covax, which originally aimed to provide two billion doses by the end of 2021 but repeatedly cut its forecasts because of production problems, export bans and vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.

When researchers examine the stands people take on specific issues, things become more complex.  Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts and a co-director of the Cooperative Election Study, provided The Times with data on levels of support and opposition on a wide range of issues for Democratic men, Democratic women, Republican men and Republican women.  “One thing that strikes me is that Democratic men and women have very similar issue positions, but Republican women are consistently less conservative on the issues compared to Republican men,” Schaffner wrote by email. “Sometimes the gap between Republican men and women is actually quite large, for example on issues like equal pay, minimum wage, right to strike and prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity/sexual orientation.”  Take, for example, the question of whether workers should have the right to strike. Almost identical percentages of Democratic men (84) and women (85) agreed, but Republican men and women split 42-58. Similarly, 90 percent of Democratic men and 92 percent of Democratic women support reviving Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act — which was designed to prohibit discriminatory electoral practices — while 37 percent of Republican men supported that position and 56 percent of Republican women did. On legislation requiring equal pay for men and women, 93 percent of Democratic men and 97 percent of Democratic women were in support, compared with 70 percent of Republican men and 85 percent of Republican women.  Natalie Jackson, director of research at P.R.R.I., provided The Times with poll data posing similar questions. Asked if “America is in danger of losing its culture and identity,” the P.R.R.I. survey found that 80 percent of Republican women and 82 percent of Republican men agreed, while 65 percent of Democratic women and 66 percent of Democratic men disagreed. Seventy-six percent of Democratic women and 77 percent of Democratic men agreed that undocumented immigrants living in this country should be allowed “to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements,” while 46 percent of Republican women and 39 percent of Republican men agreed.  Conflicting attitudes toward risk also drive partisanship. In “Culture and Identity-Protective Cognition: Explaining the White Male Effect in Risk Perception,” a 2007 paper by Dan M. Kahan of Yale Law School, Donald Braman of George Washington University Law School, John Gastil of Penn State, Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon and C.K. Mertz of Decision Research, the researchers studied the attitudes toward risks posed by guns and by environmental dangers. Drawing on a survey of 1,844 Americans, their key finding was:  Individuals selectively credit and dismiss asserted dangers in a manner supportive of their preferred form of social organization. This dynamic, it is hypothesized, drives the “white male effect,” which reflects the risk skepticism that hierarchical and individualistic white males display when activities integral to their cultural identities are challenged as harmful.  The authors reported that conservative white Republican men (“persons who held relative hierarchical and individualistic outlooks — and particularly both simultaneously”) are the “least concerned about environmental risks and gun risks.” People “who held relatively egalitarian and communitarian views” — predominantly Democrats — “were most concerned.”  On environmental risk, the people who were most risk tolerant were white men, followed by white women, then minority-group men and, the most risk averse, minority-group women. The order was slightly different in the case of risk associated with guns: White men demonstrated the least risk aversion followed by minority-group men, then white women and finally minority-group women.

The Supreme Court decided to take a look at New York regulations that set a pretty high bar on the right to, say, carry a revolver in your pocket when you go out for a walk. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. “The Supreme Court keeps me up at night. For all kinds of reasons,” Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told me.  Lawmakers from Connecticut tend to be very concerned about this kind of issue, an obsession that goes back to 2012, when a 20-year-old stole his mother’s gun and then killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, 20 of them children.  The Newtown shooting shocked the world, and many of us — simpletons that we were — presumed it would be the start of a whole new American attitude toward guns.  Certainly didn’t imagine that this month we’d be watching activists, many of them survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in 2018, place 1,100 body bags on the National Mall. Each bag stood for about 150 lives lost to guns since Parkland — including homicides, accidental gun deaths and suicides. Organizers said there was no way to include one for each victim since that would have meant 170,000 body bags.  And how’s Biden, who clearly sees himself as a champion of gun safety regulation, doing? “It depends on what your expectations were,” Blumenthal said, carefully. While many anti-gun activists say they’ve been disappointed, Blumenthal still has a lot of hope. “He’s more passionate and determined than any president in my memory,” the senator said.  Definitely more than the guy who came before. Like most New Yorkers, Donald Trump sympathized with gun control for most of his life. Then he began making political speeches and told people he was stunned — stunned! — by how enthusiastic Republican crowds got if you gave a shout-out for the right to bear arms. Instant switcheroo.  Biden’s been consistent, if not always successful. His first attempt to name a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives imploded when the Second Amendment lobby managed to torpedo the nomination of gun control activist David Chipman last year. “Either this was impossible to win or the strategy failed,” Chipman said afterward — an analysis that could be used for many, many administration encounters with the United States Senate.

But the increases were based on the assumptions that offenders would receive and distribute such images in printed form through the mail and that more images suggested more effort and criminal activity. Because of the online ease of sending and receiving huge numbers of images, penalties intended for the most severe offenders ended up being applied to most of them.  Judge Jackson explained the shift during the hearing. “At the time that the guidelines were created for child pornography, this crime was primarily being committed by people who were literally mailing one, two, five, 10, 100 photos at a time,” she said. “In comes the internet. On the internet, with one click, you can receive, you can distribute, tens of thousands. You can be doing this for 15 minutes, and all of a sudden you are looking at 30, 40, 50 years in prison.”  In 2012 the U.S. Sentencing Commission told Congress that the sentencing scheme was out of date for crimes involving child sexual abuse images. This “results in overly severe guideline ranges for some offenders,” the commission said. (Republicans have faulted Judge Jackson for this, too, since she was on the commission at the time — even though it was bipartisan and issued its report unanimously.)  There is no political will in Congress for fixing this legal problem. In 2021, when Judge Jackson was no longer on the sentencing commission, it issued another report pointing out that judges “increasingly believed the sentencing scheme for such offenders was overly severe.” Senator Hawley said this week that he plans to introduce legislation that would make sentences even longer.  The complicated history did not fit so easily into a sound bite or tweet. Judge Jackson had to explain why the guidelines are overly punitive in many cases while trying to make clear that the crimes do very real damage to very real victims.  “What we’re trying to do is be rational in our dealing with some of the most horrible kinds of behavior,” Judge Jackson said. “This is what our justice system is about.”  But often, the justice system is not rational. That’s why mass incarceration is entrenched in the United States, which has far higher rates of imprisonment than our peer countries.

American power didn’t seem to be obviously declining. China was integrating with the Western world and liberalizing to some degree, not charting its own civilizational course. Russia in Putin’s first term seemed to aspire to alliances with America and Europe and to a certain kind of democratic normalcy. In India the forces of Hindu nationalism weren’t ascendant yet. And even in the Muslim world, there were repeated moments, from the Green Movement in Iran to the Arab Spring, that seemed to promise 1989-style democratic revolutions followed by convergence with the West.  The first years of the 21st century, in other words, provided a fair amount of evidence for the universal appeal of Western capitalism, liberalism and democracy, with outright opposition to those values confined to the margins — Islamists, far-left critics of globalization, the government of North Korea.  The last decade, on the other hand, has made Huntington’s predictions of civilizational divergence look much more prescient. It isn’t just that American power has obviously declined relative to our rivals and competitors, or that our post-9/11 efforts to spread Western values by force of arms so often came to grief. The specific divergences between the world’s major powers have also followed, in general ways, the civilizational patterns Huntington sketched out.  China’s one-party meritocracy, Putin’s uncrowned czardom, the post-Arab Spring triumph of dictatorship and monarchy over religious populism in the Middle East, the Hindutva populism transforming Indian democracy — these aren’t just all indistinguishable forms of “autocracy,” but culturally distinctive developments that fit well with Huntington’s typology, his assumption that specific civilizational inheritances would manifest themselves as Western power diminishes, as American might recedes.  And then, just as tellingly, the region where this recent divergence has been weaker, the post-Cold War wave of democratization more resilient, is Latin America, about which Huntington acknowledged some uncertainty whether it deserved its own civilizational category, or whether it essentially belonged with the United States and Western Europe. (He chose the former; the latter seems more plausible today.)  Then what about Huntington’s specific predictions about Ukraine, raised by Roy and Caldwell in critique? Well, there he did get something wrong: Though he accurately foresaw internal Ukrainian divisions, the split between the Orthodox and Russian-speaking east and the more Catholic and Western-leaning west, his assumption that civilizational alignments would trump national ones hasn’t been borne out in Putin’s war, in which eastern Ukraine has resisted Russia fiercely.  That example fits a larger pattern: None of the emerging non-Western great powers have yet built grand alliances based on civilizational affinities, meaning that the third of the four big Huntingtonian predictions looks like the weakest one today. He imagined, for instance, that a rising China might be able to peacefully integrate Taiwan and maybe even draw Japan into its sphere of influence; that scenario seems highly unlikely at the moment. Instead, wherever smaller countries are somehow “torn,” in his language, between some other civilization and the liberal West, they usually prefer an American alliance to an alignment with Moscow or Beijing.

You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays.  In a letter to shareholders last week, Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, issued a striking warning about a shift he perceived in the global economic order. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had compelled governments and private companies like his own to retaliate by severing business ties with Russia. This response was justified, he wrote, but it had come at a cost: “an end to the globalization we have experienced over the last three decades.”  It’s a sweeping claim, and Fink is far from alone in making it. But what would the end of globalization actually look like, and how would a transformation of international trade affect the daily lives of citizens around the globe? Are such predictions premature? Here’s what people are saying.  Globalization and its discontents  For the past several decades, the story of the global economy has been one of rapid liberalization and integration. Since the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, trade deals, innovation in communications technology, and shipping improvements lowered the barriers to international trade. The benefits of this shift, in the eyes of its proponents, were so unequivocal that it became a political imperative: Globalization allowed richer nations to reap the fruits of poorer countries’ lower labor costs. That, in turn, allowed those poorer countries — most notably China — to develop more quickly than they would have had they remained isolated.  But globalization produced many losers as well as winners: The wave of cheaper consumer products came at the expense of regions and workers dependent on domestic manufacturing jobs.

And this is “The Argument.” This week, I’ve been thinking about how tech companies are reacting to the war in Ukraine because it’s been noticeable who’s siding with Ukraine and who’s limiting services in Russia. And as someone who cares a lot about regulation and self regulation of big tech, — and I hate the term, “big tech” — it seems like a big moment, a time to reconsider how we feel about the power of these companies and how that’s playing out in a global conflict. So I invited two people on today who report on tech’s role in our lives, Robby Soave and Charlie Warzel. Charlie, Robby and I now live, like, a block away from each other.  charlie warzel  Fancy.  jane coaston  Yeah, Navy Yard. It’s all happening.  charlie warzel  It is all happening.  robby soave  I’m always in the backing shots of people’s wedding photos that they take by the water.  charlie warzel  It’s good. It’s good to be supportive.  jane coaston  I know, and I’m very supportive. You know how I feel about the institution of marriage. Anyway, thank you both for coming back on the show. For listeners who don’t know you, Robby is a senior editor of Reason Magazine, and you also wrote a book called Tech Panic. And Charlie is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and author of a great newsletter called “Galaxy Brain,” which is truly galaxy brain. And I wanted to talk to both of you because you both have conflicting and really interesting views on the role that tech companies play in our daily lives. And now we’re in the midst of the war in Ukraine, and we’ve seen how companies can cut off services and users in countries involved in these horrifying skirmishes. But how should they decide where and when to do that and who gets to be able to tell them how to do so, I think, is a little more complicated. Just to lay out some of the specifics, because I think it’s actually pretty interesting because it differs from how we’ve seen this happening in other places — Spotify is pulling out of Russia. Apple has limited access to Apple Pay and the App Store in Russia. Google has disabled live map features and provided alerts to U.N. resources for Ukrainian refugees. Meta has blocked access to state media channels like Russia Today and Sputnik. Netflix has suspended streaming services — very stressful for anyone who is attempting to catch up on — I don’t know — “Stranger Things” or something. And Airbnb is working with hosts in countries close to Ukraine to house up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing the war. You’re both people who think about tech and cover tech for a living. Were you surprised by how quickly tech companies took a stand? Charlie, were you surprised?  charlie warzel  No, not really. I mean, the way that I think these companies operate from my reporting inside of them and also speaking to lots of people who have left those companies, is this isn’t a well composed symphony, their decisions. It is jazz, right? It’s free form stuff. I think a lot of their decisions are made on the fly, responding to all kinds of pressures, internal, external, in some sense, responding to, quote unquote like, “vibes,” right, that they’re getting off of the small group of people they follow on social media, a specific set of executives. And because there’s not a wonderful chain of command there, I think what you have is you have a very quick panic to be seen as doing something, right? So I’m not surprised that they’ve moved the way that they have. But I think, what I see out of it, is that they’re making a lot of ad hoc decisions. And I’m not sure whether or not those are grounded in a set of well-defined policies or morals that they had previously.  jane coaston  Right, and Robby, I’m curious as to your thought on how these tech companies are making these decisions because they are ad hoc. You could make the argument that, well, why isn’t Meta cutting off the Ethiopian government for the crimes it’s committing against the Tigrayan people? You could do this all day with, why don’t they do this? Why do they do that?  robby soave  Yeah, and look, I agree. In probably the large part with what Charlie just said, it can feel or look random, and you can play the hypocrisy game with these companies, like you just said, to the end of time. It’ll always be the case where you can go, well, why is video X up on YouTube, but not video Y when video Y — whichever one is still up seems to be violating whatever the policy is more than the one that was taken down. And the answer is just like, well, somebody complained about that one, or an algorithm flagged it and no one has moderated the other one yet. It’s retroactive. It’s like the coach goes back over the play afterward, after the play has already happened. But specifically, with some of this decision-making, is not actually random or ad hoc, but is being forced on these companies by governments, right? Some of the bad moderation or calls or whatever you want that we get from Meta and from Google and from Twitter are things that governments either explicitly or implicitly wanted them to do. And that’s where I start drawing the line. With Covid misinformation, there was a lot of, well, we would really like you to maybe not have people talking about, for instance, the lab leak theory on Facebook, that kind of stuff, that was, if not explicitly required, was very much something the government wanted to push those companies to do. And I think it’s interesting that in a lot of those cases, you basically had the companies kind of fold or not stand up and say, excuse us, we’re private companies. We can do whatever we want, which is what I, as a libertarian, would like to see them do, and probably ends up hurting them in the long run or harming their ability to make that argument that, no, we are private entities, and we should be the ones setting our own policies when they appear to fold so often.  jane coaston  So let’s say if Meta and Twitter, if they weren’t aligned with, one, U.S. foreign policy, and, two, general American sentiment, if Meta had said, actually, we are deeply supportive of Putin’s regime, and we think that Ukraine has always been a part of Russia. Long live the Russian Empire. Nicholas II was a hero. Would your stance change, or how do you think that that would influence how the government was thinking about them right now and how foreign governments would be thinking about them?  robby soave  Well, I don’t think our government should do anything in the case that that were to happen. I mean, well, let’s not forget we’re not formally at war with Russia.  jane coaston  We are not.  robby soave  I think if the companies were to take the position you just outlined, well, I would just let their customers, their consumers, their users, vent that frustration and punish them to the extent they can. They would probably take it on the chin to some extent, at least. Now, obviously, now we’re in a situation where many of these companies have had very little to say about China’s mistreatment against its Uyghur population. Everyone has a level at which they want to engage in personal boycotts or say, you know what, I’m not participating with this company that has somewhat different politics from me. So you would expect a company to suffer economically from going squarely against this kind of thing, which so many people feel the other way. But it would be an interesting experiment.  charlie warzel  Yeah, my thought to your question there was just simply, it couldn’t happen. It’s really interesting to put yourself in the position of what if something very consequential, that’s very much against the mainstream political consensus, but I also think that that’s a bit of the way that these companies operate, is they’re just — when it is that strong, I don’t think they have the backbones to even go against it. Not that they should, but I’m saying I just don’t think that that’s how they operate.  jane coaston  I think, though, Charlie, because in the past, Meta products, even saying Meta products, I’m like, ugh.  charlie warzel  Yeah, I think Meta is for narcs. I think we should all just go back to Facebook. I mean, but no free ads.  robby soave  Yeah.  charlie warzel  No free ads here.  jane coaston  Yeah, no, no.  charlie warzel  What’s this Xfinity situation? No, you’re Comcast, and you’ve made my life miserable.  jane coaston  Yeah, or it’s like, no, no, no, it’s Alphabet now. I’m like, no, it’s not. Anyway, I don’t think that we are seeing a time at which tech companies are as influential as a country for one thing. Twitter has many things, but it does not yet have the power of state violence. What does it say to you about the power of these tech companies? Because on the one hand, yes, they’re making these big gestures or curtailing access or having their access curtailed by the Russian government, but like, that hasn’t ended the war.  charlie warzel  Yeah, this is probably where we’ll have the most points of disagreement. So I want to be clear that I have, quote unquote, “eported on information warfare for a long time. And one of the salient lessons of the last month has been the gulf between actual warfare and information warfare. Obviously, when you are looking at the destruction of cities, there is a difference between that and a content moderation policy, obviously. I think it’s foolish to dismiss the power of these companies and the way that they shape narratives, the way that they shape the views of the people living in these countries who are both consuming and creating the content, the type of content they create. Do I think that Facebook, Twitter, any of these groups could do anything at any moment that would change Vladimir Putin’s mind? No. But I think that that’s not really a productive way to think about it necessarily. I have been just really taken with watching the ways, especially on a platform like TikTok, watching the ways that this war is being broadcast. I brought it up before, but I’ve just seen so many videos that have just popped into my feed through the magic of whatever their algorithms are, that show us how this war is playing out in a very personal, intimate way. I think that has a profound effect on the way that people everywhere view this conflict, the way that it will be written about, the way that it will be cataloged. And I think we dismiss that power at our own peril. This is the most visible conflict that we probably ever had, from an average person being able to go down various specific rabbit holes and see things. I think that is incredibly important, the way that that can ratchet up pressure on various entities, you know, at home and abroad. Is it like a hard power kind of importance? Probably not necessarily. But I don’t think that that takes away from the ways that they are shaping our world and the way that we see it.  robby soave  I don’t disagree with any of what Charlie just said, and yes, they are having an important impact, but it’s still, to me, kind of along the same spectrum of reporting on past conflicts that have shaped from pictures of atrocities in the Vietnam War being published, the invention of the printing press, something we would probably all agree is something that had to happen. I can’t really imagine or don’t want to imagine a world where we’re still existing in pre-printing press technology. But the immediate impact of the printing press was like years and years of horrifying religious warfare. So technology has its ups and downs. Certainly, I don’t think any of us would argue that it’s not going to have an impact on our lives and how we view conflict, but it always has.  jane coaston  It’s interesting to me because, Charlie, you talked about these companies being reactive. But in general, if you’re a nice old American-based tech company, your understanding of the work that you do in other countries is going to be reactive. It’s going to be like, we don’t have a policy in place for if you invade a territory next to you. Like, if not reactivity, what should these companies be doing?  charlie warzel  So, in one sense, I think you’re completely right. And yes, we’re in uncharted territory, to some degree. That’s also why I get a little nervous with these companies because I don’t necessarily trust their decision-making apparatus. There are places, though, where you could have stronger policies in place that aren’t specific to Vladimir Putin invades X country or war in Europe. And I, too, am glad that Facebook doesn’t necessarily have those types of things, disaster scenarios outlined. A good example, I think, comes from more nitty gritty, maybe banal types of policies. So when we’re talking about accountability and transparency, there is still not a wonderful transparency process for taking down different channels, right? There’s now become a decent apparatus. There’s the Facebook, Supreme Court, whatever, that exists for content moderation issues. But even then, those things, they don’t really set precedent, right? And I think when it comes to takedowns of big channels, there should be specific processes that we all know and understand, that we can go through the nerds and researchers and academics can go through and see exactly the process by which this went through, the escalations, the chain of command, who made the decision. And that these channels could be archived and be used for specific research purposes, or — I don’t know — you name the purpose. I think that’s very important. In my reporting a couple of weeks ago, I talked with Brandon Silverman, who created the tool CrowdTangle, which is bought by Facebook. It’s a tool that allows you to see how pieces of content travel around the internet. Facebook used it in order to sort of have a good grasp of what is going viral on its platform. And eventually, he left Facebook. He, for example, is extremely worried about the way that Facebook and/or Meta is going about the issues of transparency, what they are taking down, what they are not. That gives me a sense of alarm, considering that he’s someone who’s been inside one of these companies, knows these issues very well, and sees the decisions being made in a way that, again, are not part of any kind of larger process.  robby soave  Look, I have a alarm as well. I’ve actually recently been on the other end of a content moderation decision that I think was insane. So I, in addition to writing for Reason, I co-host a YouTube show for The Hill, which is called “Rising,” and we were suspended recently from YouTube for seven days for violating their election misinformation policy, allegedly. What we did was we played — it’s a news show. We had a clip of Trump giving an interview, and this was a segment about Ukraine, so it was what Trump was saying about Ukraine, in which he used the phrase, “rigged election.” And then after we finished playing the clip, we went on to criticize Trump for any number of reasons. But because we did not specifically correct — in that segment, we didn’t say, oh, by the way, that election misinformation claim is wrong, even though everyone watching our show knows we think that it’s wrong. They said it was as if we were promoting that claim, and we got suspended for seven days. I actually think it’s a decision that imperils all journalism on YouTube. Sort of, my reaction is, OK, got to look at what other platforms are available. If I don’t like YouTube’s policies and I can’t change them, and they don’t want to change them, then I’m going to have to look at other alternatives. I certainly don’t — despite not liking YouTube’s judgment in this case and many others, I would not want to substitute their judgment certainly for the government’s judgment. I mean, we talk about, could there be some collective democratic decision-making process? And that exists in like a fantasyland, where the real world is people with as at odds opinions as Elizabeth Warren and Josh Hawley, you know, trying to come up with what the ideal content moderation position — trying to reckon with both —  jane coaston  That’s what hell is.  robby soave  Right, it looks terrible to put this in the hands of the government.  charlie warzel  But this is why I think if it is to get in the hands of the government at some point, and we’re a little, I guess, field of Ukraine at the moment, but I think there’s all sorts of inroads for government, quote unquote, intervention here that have so much less to do with this speech good, this particular thing bad, and more about data transparency, but also the idea of things we can do to support quality, right? If you look at Facebook right now, one of the biggest issues with Facebook is that there’s so much garbage on Facebook, that Facebook is like a chum content click farm that’s having content pumped into it. That is a big problem. And it doesn’t involve necessarily us talking about different types of political speech. It’s how do we start incentivizing people, studios, whatever, to create content on the platform that is quality?  jane coaston  When we start getting into how we define content and whether content is quality or not, I do not trust either the government or these entities to decide what that means. I don’t trust anyone. It’s a nice life that I lead. But I am curious, I generally think that most people’s basic inclination is to do whatever will get the fewest people to yell at them. And so we see this with regard to whether it’s kicking Trump off Twitter or whether it’s Zuckerberg’s kind of leaning towards conservatives in a very specific way on Facebook, you see that kind of like, if I do this, will you stop yelling at me? And in my view, it seems to be largely performative. Like, do you think this is a moral stance, or do you think these companies are like, this seems to be where people want us to go, and if we don’t go there, people will yell at us?  robby soave  Yeah, I think that does guide their decision-making. I think it’s irrational, don’t yell at us, because it’s not just, don’t yell at us, it’s, don’t yell at us and don’t break our company apart. Don’t regulate us out of existence. Don’t punish us in very tangible ways. And some of the worst social media content moderation decisions have been born of that kind of, well, how do we avoid — I mean, to be frank, how do we avoid infuriating the kind of liberal Democrat overlord in the current iteration? And talking about the lab leak decision and, frankly, the Hunter Biden laptop decision, which is now certainly the thing that animates most of the conservative anti-Big Tech sort of voices, the thing that is what they will point to as the reason Big Tech must be destroyed and the reason we’re against big tech. But the solution is for our government — and Republicans are just as guilty of this, if not more guilty of this. If you want them to stop in a knee-jerk fashion doing bad, reactive things in order to not get crushed by the government, then members of the government need to stop yelling at them to do things. In an ideal world, right, they would refuse. Someone would say, we want this to be your policy. Facebook would say, no, I refuse. And then the A.C.L.U. would write a letter, saying that no, because of the First Amendment, they don’t have to follow you. For some reason, that is very much not the world we’re living in. But I don’t know. I would like to visit that planet. [MUSIC PLAYING]  archived recording Hi, this is Tom from Janesville, Wisconsin. And the thing I’ve been arguing about is how we are going to pay for all these new Biden programs that are being proposed. I know we would all like to soak the rich with tax increases, but are there enough rich people with enough money to tax so we can pay for all this stuff? Thank you.  jane coaston  What are you arguing about with your family, your friends, your frenemies? Tell me about the big debate you’re having in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324. And we might play an excerpt of it on a future episode. [MUSIC PLAYING] Charlie, do you think that what tech is doing in response to the war in Ukraine, is that a watershed moment in how we think about tech and its responsibilities?  charlie warzel  I don’t know if we know yet whether this is a watershed moment. I think, too, something that it’s going to be very interesting to follow is, how these companies behave when, you know, there’s more fatigue in people’s tracking and understanding of this. I don’t know if any of this is going to stick. What if there’s a ceasefire that is brokered, right? And the war is not necessarily over. The sanctions are still in place. What do these social media companies do then, right? Do they start restoring some of this access because there’s not actual shots being fired on the ground? I don’t think we know. And I think if you asked these companies right now — and this is a bit of why I get frustrated — I don’t think they have any idea. I’m not even sure if they’re preparing from the reporting that I’ve done for questions like that down the road. I think that they are in pure, sort of, as we said, reactive territory.  jane coaston  Right, I want to make it very clear here that I don’t have any good answers, and I don’t think that there is an entity that could come in and make it better or less so of whatever it is right now. Like, Facebook, no matter what they say now, they did not intend to become a newspaper or the equivalent of a newsgathering entity or a news producing entity at the beginning. And I’m interested to hear what you think about how these tech companies could or should change their services or think about their services in these kind of unprecedented times.  robby soave  Yeah, my only beef with that is that we should not pretend that tech companies and tech companies alone have these perverse incentives to ratchet up anger, or traditional media companies have that same incentive and are doing it, absolutely. Radio has the same incentive. Book publishers — or often, when the book doesn’t fail, it’s because they published some very incendiary tome. These incentives exist across the board in media and I think are worrisome. Actually, there’s a lot of people who exist in those other media spaces, all wanting to deflect toward, oh, yeah, look at those algorithms. Facebook, YouTube, very scary. Like, OK, what are you doing? What was the last headline you wrote?  charlie warzel  I think that that’s true. But I would say — and you acknowledge this, right, the ways in which the technology is just more intense. It’s like if you turn on your television and the channel just keeps switching, right, you don’t actually have control over which thing you’re viewing, right? You’re on Fox for a minute, getting mad, and then all of a sudden, you’re on MSNBC, getting mad. And then — I don’t know — you’re getting a livestream of Joe Rogan and getting mad, especially when you have something like TikTok, which is literally just a constant stream of algorithmically curated only, unless you’re just following people.  robby soave  But isn’t that better than just watching MSNBC or just watching Fox, which is what people do when they turn on the T.V.? They’re only getting one stream of anger, whereas at least on social media, though it is slightly curated to my interest and is selecting maybe for things I’ve already engaged with, I’m more likely to stumble across other less challenging things than I am when I, being a theoretical person watching T.V. all day or listening to the radio all day.  charlie warzel  Potentially, or in some cases, you’re more likely to feel like you have that choice and to be given things that are really just kind of in what your previous choices have created as an acceptable sort of bubble of what you’re going to be fed. I mean, I think that we always underestimate the largeness of the moment when it comes to the technological revolution and what the internet hath wrought on us over this 25-year period. And I think that the upheaval that we see is something that we, in some cases, don’t have tons of control over, right? Because people are coming online. There is a real democratization of opinions. And I think that it’s almost foolish to have this conversation about regulation with the idea of what is the thing we can immediately pinpoint that’s going to fix this right now. Has there ever been an entity as large as Facebook in terms of actually connecting human beings? I mean, it seems odd to me that, you know, especially in the United States government, we can start politically caring about this in the aftermath of the 2016 election. And oh, well, it’s 2022. Why don’t we have a perfect solution right now? I think that we kind of pigeonhole ourselves, and we write off either, you know, there’s no good way to regulate these entities that’s not going to destroy speech, or we absolutely have to regulate them. Why haven’t we done it now? Why can’t we just come up with a very simple solution? Why can’t we repeal this law and get it over and done with, and everything is going to be fine on the internet? This is like a multi-generational challenge we have in front of us.  jane coaston  I keep thinking about how so much of this is that people are interacting with these companies often and see these companies of being more reactive to them than the government is. They can get Twitter to pull down a user they don’t like or to block someone with more alacrity than they can get the government to do basically anything. As kind of my closing question, how much of this the way we want tech corporations to act in the midst of a war? Is this, in part, because these companies seem to have more direct, measurable impact on our lives than the government does, even if that’s not actually true?  charlie warzel  Well, I do think that they definitely feel more responsive than the government. And I think there’s a difference how people feel when they’re using a social media product. It does feel like you have sort of a more intimate relationship and understanding of it. Maybe you don’t as a company. Maybe don’t necessarily technologically, but it feels as if you do. I mean, I don’t think most people have a very coherent understanding of what they want these platforms to do necessarily outside of individual you know, take this down, or I have a very specific experience, and I’d like this to be ameliorated. And I think another problem of that is that I don’t think the platforms themselves have a coherent understanding of how they want all this to be, other than I don’t want you to yell at me. I think it all speaks, again — hopefully it’s not a cop-out to this — we are grappling with generational problems right now. And I think we’re in the earliest days of understanding them. So I don’t really think we have a coherent understanding of what we want out of all this.  jane coaston  Well, on that encouraging note, thank you so much for joining me.  robby soave  My pleasure.  charlie warzel  Thanks for having me.

I fervently hope it’s with a free, secure and independent Ukraine. But here is what I know for sure: America must not waste this crisis. This is our umpteenth confrontation with a petro-dictator whose viciousness and recklessness are possible only because of the oil wealth he extracts from the ground. No matter how the war ends in Ukraine, it needs to end with America finally, formally, categorically and irreversibly ending its addiction to oil.  Nothing has distorted our foreign policy, our commitments to human rights, our national security and, most of all, our environment than our oil addiction. Let this be the last war in which we and our allies fund both sides. That’s what we do. Western nations fund NATO and aid Ukraine’s military with our tax dollars, and — since Russia’s energy exports finance 40 percent of its state budget — we fund Vladimir Putin’s army with our purchases of Russian oil and gas.  Now, how stupid is that?  Our civilization simply cannot afford this anymore. Climate change has not taken a timeout for the war in Ukraine. Have you checked the weather report for the North and South Poles lately? Simultaneous extreme heat waves gripped part of Antarctica this month, driving temperatures there to 70 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average for this time of year, and areas of the Arctic, making them more than 50 degrees warmer than average.  Those are not typos. Those are crazy superextremes.  “They are opposite seasons — you don’t see the North and the South (Poles) both melting at the same time,” Walter Meier, a researcher with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, recently told The Associated Press. “It’s definitely an unusual occurrence.” And last Friday, no surprise, scientists announced that an ice shelf the size of New York City had collapsed in East Antarctica at the beginning of this freakish warm spell.

It was in poor taste for Mr. Rock to poke fun at her hair. He has reportedly said he did not know about her alopecia, but he probably at least knew that the joke would sting, since he produced the documentary “Good Hair,” about Black women and their often fraught relationships with their hair.  Ms. Pinkett Smith has spoken openly about her struggles with hair loss — which is difficult for anyone but especially hard in the sexist and image-conscious world of American celebrity, where women, especially, endure an endless litany of comments about their appearance, their sartorial choices, their relationships and anything else people can find to pick apart. Famous women such as Whitney Houston, Britney Spears, Amanda Bynes, Janet Jackson, Monica Lewinsky and Meghan Markle have been pushed to the edge by such scrutiny and the unreasonable expectation that they thicken their skin to derision, disrespect, insults and jokes. Even if later, long after these public shamings, their treatment is re-examined and condemned, the measly acts of public contrition are too little, too late. The damage is done.  Violence is always wrong and solves very little. Mr. Smith could have made so many better choices that did not involve putting his hands on another person in front of the entire world. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opened an inquiry into the incident Monday afternoon, and Mr. Smith apologized to Mr. Rock and the world on Monday evening via Instagram.  Still, Mr. Smith most likely saw his wife’s pain, and it’s possible he was himself experiencing a moment of fragility, of thin skin. In his memoir, “Will,” the actor writes about the guilt he felt because, as a child, he could not protect his mother from his father’s abuse. Mr. Rock’s gibe was not in any way the same thing as domestic violence, but I can see how Mr. Smith might not have been able to take that joke, at his wife’s expense, given the layers of context and public and private histories leading into that evening.  I am trying to hold space for all of those layers — Ms. Pinkett Smith’s exhaustion with being a target of humor, Mr. Smith’s series of bad decisions and Mr. Rock’s trying to maintain his composure in the immediate aftermath of being a target of violence. Unfortunately, the incident has become something of a Rorschach test onto which people project their backgrounds, opinions and affinities. And what gets lost in the discourse is that, however disappointing the incident was, it was also a rare moment when a Black woman was publicly defended.  We also witnessed an example, last week, of a woman forced to wear incredibly thick skin as she was left largely undefended. During Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, that distinguished jurist endured all manner of insult, racism and misogyny from Republican senators asking ludicrous questions that were really opportunities for grandstanding. Judge Jackson was applauded in many circles for her calm and composure.  For many Black women, it was a painful spectacle because we know what it is like to experience that kind of scrutiny, interrogation and disrespect in personal and professional settings. We know what it’s like to withstand scrutiny without intervention. We understood that the only way forward for Judge Jackson was to remain composed, stoic, impervious. We also noted that other than Senator Cory Booker, Democrats failed to protect their president’s nominee. The Senate Judiciary Committee apparently valued decorum over Judge Jackson’s dignity.

He’s been saying often and to everyone that the risk of inflation was way higher than most economists believed. He flayed President Biden’s American Rescue Plan for being way too much stimulus too fast. Month after month, he said that the inflation— it wasn’t just transitory. It wasn’t just going to go away. These weren’t just supply chain problems that would unkink. That this wasn’t just going to be a problem of autos and energy. That the markets were wrong, and the forecasters were wrong, and the pundits were wrong, and the Fed was wrong, and we were headed for a serious bout of inflation. And damn it, he was more right than he was wrong. You can debate, and people do, if he was right for the right reasons or right for some of the wrong reasons, or its contingency, or luck, or what will happen next. But things he was saying six months ago are conventional wisdom now. Inflation is still here. It seems in many ways to be getting worse, even as the economy is weakening a bit. The idea of transitory inflation— that is gone. That has been retired. The data now shows that the inflation is pretty broad-based. It’s not just in a few goods. The Fed is raising rates much, much faster than it had intended, or projected, or said it would be. Though, to be fair, still not nearly fast enough for Summers. Fear of inflation is now a central risk to Democrats in the midterms and a really big challenge for the rest of Biden’s agenda. We are, unfortunately, living much more in the world Larry Summers predicted than in the world I’d hoped to be inhabiting right now. And it could be about to get worse. If I was telling you not just my optimistic story a few months ago but the thing I thought would happen, my baseline scenario, I would have said that the inflation did reflect too much demand in an economy that was more constrained and warped and made weird by the pandemic than we’d expected. But as the pandemic eased, those disruptions and constraints would lift, inflation would calm. We’d have more workers. We’d have more production. Things would get a lot better. But then Russia invaded Ukraine, creating a whole new disaster in the energy and commodity markets. Omicron began battering China. And we’ve seen huge lockdowns in regions like Shenzhen, which are critical for global manufacturing supply chains. So the disruptions— they may not be ending. They may be about to get worse. I think a criticism Summers is made of many of us is that we have taken an optimistic prediction of how the world would go as a baseline prediction. And I think this is a moment when I’m really reflecting on that idea, because we’re really seeing how much could go wrong that either wasn’t well-predicted or just wasn’t built in to enough of our forecasts. So I asked Larry Summers to come on the show. I still hope he’s too pessimistic. I still hope much of what he’s recommending will prove unnecessary. But my hopes here have been dashed before. And at the very least, he has earned a hearing and then some for his grim forecast. As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Larry Summers, welcome to the show.  larry summers  Good to be with you, Ezra.  ezra klein  So I would say it’s fair to say that over the past year, year and change, you’ve been more worried about the economic downside, more worried about inflation, more worried about things going wrong than a lot of other people. And then in the past couple of weeks, we have seen Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have seen new pandemic lockdowns in China. So where is your level of worry now? How is the Larry Summers’ forecasting function changed in the past month?  larry summers  I’m probably as apprehensive about the prospects for a soft landing of the U.S. economy as I have been any time in the last year. Probably actually a bit more apprehensive. In a way, the situation continues to resemble the 1970s, Ezra. In the late ‘60s and in the early ‘70s, we made mistakes of excessive demand expansion that created an inflationary environment. And then we caught really terrible luck with bad supply shocks from OPEC, bad supply shocks from elsewhere. And it all added up to a macroeconomic mess. And in many ways, that’s the right analogy for now. Just as L.B.J.‘s guns and butter created excessive and dangerous inflationary pressure, the macroeconomic over-expansion of 2021 created those problems, and then layered on with something entirely separate, in terms of the further supply shocks we’ve seen in oil and in food. And so now I think we’ve got a real problem of high underlying inflation that I don’t think will come down to anything like acceptable levels of its own accord. And so very difficult dilemmas as to whether to accept economic restraint or to live with high and quite possibly accelerating inflation. So I don’t envy the tasks that the Fed has before it.  ezra klein  So I want to pull some pieces of this apart and get some of this into more natural language. So inflation can have a demand side and a supply side. And the demand side is too much money chasing too few goods, or even just chasing the normal amount of goods. But too much money, too much— people are buying too much.  larry summers  That’s right.  ezra klein  And then there’s a supply side. We are not being able to produce the goods. Factories are not being able to do things. There’s a war where an important natural resource is developed or there’s a lockdown where there’s a lot of manufacturing capacity. And the argument you’ve been having with a lot of other economists, to some degree with the Fed over the past year, is whether 2021’s inflation was coming from demand— we did too much stimulus— or supply— the pandemic had just messed up supply chains. But now, in addition to that argument, there’s also the question of new supply shocks is what you’re saying. That Russia and China are adding more supply problems onto whatever we already had. Is that the right way to think about it?  larry summers  I think that’s right in part, but I think it restates what I think is a bit of a popular confusion in the following sense— supply is what it is. Monetary policy can’t change it. Fiscal policy can’t change it, except in the long-run. And so given what supply is, it’s the task of demand to balance supply. And if demand is greater than supply, then you’re going to have excess inflation and you’re going to have the problems of financial excess. So the job of the demand managers, principally the Fed, is to judge what supply is and calibrate appropriately. It’s not an excuse for inflation to blame it on supply. It’s a reality in the environment that you have to deal with. And so the job is to look for measures of overheating, and when you see measures of overheating, to apply restraint. And it’s those measures that I saw as developing through 2021 that were not being responded to that led to my being quite alarmed and led to a situation where before we had the Ukraine war, before we had the new problems in China, wage inflation in the United States was running at above a 6 percent rate and the labor market was only getting tighter. So we had a problem that was of excess demand, whether the extent to which the excess demand was related to supply being different than someone might have forecast years before is a second-order question. The job is to manage so as to avoid excess demand.  ezra klein  But one of the things happening in demand now— so let’s start a couple of weeks ago before some of the newer problems fully emerged. If you believed— and I think you did believe— that a big driver of what we’re calling here excess demand was stimulus policies, credit policies, the Fed being really, really stimulative in the economy, the Biden administration putting out the stimulus checks, the American Rescue Plan being much bigger in relationship to the economic shortfall than say the Obama stimulus plan was. A lot of that is draining out in certain ways. So we’re not doing more stimulus checks. The child tax credit has expired. We’re not giving more money to state and local governments. There isn’t more— this is not recurrent stimulus. And the Fed is beginning to certainly signal, and, in fact, to do smaller, but nevertheless signal that there are a lot more coming— to begin rate increases. So if demand was the problem alone, you might look at some of these drivers and say, well, shouldn’t that be turning the ship around?  larry summers  That’s a fair question and I’d respond in a couple of ways, Ezra. First, the stimulus was short-run, but its acts were long-term. People estimate that only about 30 percent of the stimulus checks were spent. So in terms of the impact on the economy, we’re feeling very substantial stimulus on a continuing basis for the next several years. Monetary policy acts with a substantial lag. And the rising inflation meant more expansionary monetary policy because of lower real interest rates and that’s feeding through to affect the economy today. Third, the stimulus had the effect of kick-starting the economy. You got a lot of people hired. Then those people were earning incomes. Then those people spent. Then other people invested. And the cycle continued. So I think the stimulative impact, both because of the lags in the effects of stimulus and because of the kick-starting effect, is something that was very much present. That’s why almost all forecasts of growth this year are forecast to say that the economy is going to grow more rapidly than its potential. They say that the unemployment rate is going to decline. And so if you have an economy where this year the forecast is that demand is going to grow faster than supply normally grows, that’s an economy where the inflation problems are potentially going to get worse, not, in their fundamental sense, going to get better. And that’s why I have been so concerned.  ezra klein  So I know you’re a hard-nosed economist who looks at the numbers here. But I want to locate, I think, the emotional and to some degree even political frustration of this conversation, because a lot of the dynamics you’re talking about that then get framed as excess demand, there are things that feel just, that many of us have wanted for a long time. More hiring, wage increases, particularly at the bottom end, stimulus checks for people who have had a lot of bad years and didn’t have a lot of cushion behind them, child tax credit for families that could really use that. And so there are a lot of policies that came together— I mean, there was a reason the Biden administration wanted to run the economy hot. There was a long period when it didn’t just feel, the economic data showed, that expansions were not reaching people on the margins. And it felt, finally, like we were reaching people on the margins. We were putting a lot of firepower to do that. But even in this terrible time, this horrifying pandemic, we were giving people who needed it quite a bit of help. And then for that to then turn into this horrifying inflation problem, which is now eating back those wage increases, potentially going to require much sharper action from the Fed— I recognize the world doesn’t have to please me, but it is maddening. And I think one of the hard questions, before we even get into Ukraine and China— I think one of the hard questions is, does it have to be this way? Did it have to be this way? Is there some way for this to end without the people we were finally helping suffering?  larry summers  Ezra, it’s the question I think about every night. The first academic papers that I wrote as a late graduate student in the 1970s were about the benefits of high pressure labor markets. They highlighted, for example, that at that time a 1 percent increase in the employment ratio for white males went with a 6 percent increase in the employment ratio for African-American teenagers. And I highlighted that much of unemployment was not just frictional unemployment but was long-term structural unemployment that destroyed families. And so it was terribly, terribly important to avoid recessions. I went into economics because I believe that by controlling recessions and preventing downturns, you could change livelihoods for millions of families. So I share completely the emotional feelings that you describe around the benefits of a strong economy. But I think it’s very important not to be shortsighted and to recognize that what we care about is not just the level of employment this year, but the level of employment averaged over the next 10 years. That we care not just about wages and opportunities this year, but we care about wages and opportunities over the long-term. And the doctor who prescribes you painkillers that make you feel good to which you become addicted is generous and compassionate, but ultimately is very damaging to you. And while the example is a bit melodramatic, the pursuit of excessively expansionary policies that ultimately lead to inflation, which reduces people’s purchasing power, and the need for sharply contractionary policies, which hurt the biggest victims, the most disadvantaged in the society, that’s not doing the people we care most about any favor. It’s, in fact, hurting them. The excessively inflationary policies of the 1970s were, in a political sense, what brought Ronald Reagan and brought Margaret Thatcher to power. So I share your desires. I think the purpose of all of this is to help people who would otherwise have difficulty. That is what it’s all about in terms of making economic policy. But if you don’t respect the basic constraints of situations, you find yourself doing things that are counterproductive and that in the long-run prove to be harmful. You raise an interesting example when you talk about wage increases. If you look at the rate of wage increases, percentage wage increases each year for the American economy, and then you look at the increase in the purchasing power of workers each year, what you find is that as wage increases go up, the growth of purchasing power increases until you get to 4 percent or 5 percent. And when wage increases start getting above 4 percent or 5 percent, then you start having serious inflation problems and actually the purchasing power of workers is going down. So my disagreement with policies that were pursued last year had nothing to do with ends. I completely shared the end. I did not care about inflation for its own sake. But what I did care about was real wage growth over time, average levels of employment and opportunity over time, and a sense of social trust that would permit progressive policies. And I thought those vital ends were being compromised by those with good intentions but a reluctance to do calculations. And I have to say that the early evidence at this point— and it gives me no pleasure to say this— but the evidence at this moment in terms of what’s happened to real wages, in terms of what’s happened to concerns about recession, in terms of what political prognosticators are saying, suggests that those fears may, to an important extent, have been justified.  ezra klein  Yeah, it gives me no pleasure to say I’ve come to the same view. Let me go back a month into the optimistic story that people were telling— the more optimistic story about how 2022 could go— which is maybe Larry Summers is right to a large degree about 2021. And I think others felt that the problem had been that supply was more constrained because of the pandemic for all kinds of reasons than policymakers had realized. But things were getting better. And what was going to happen over the next year was there was not going to be nearly as stimulative fiscal policy from Congress or the White House, not going to be a stimulative monetary policy from the Fed, and the kinks in supply chains were going to iron themselves out, that production was going to go up as companies adjusted to where the economy was now, as production adjusted to the kind of demand people were seeing. And we were going to manage this landing after in certain ways a good, but in certain other inflationary ways a tough 2021. But then you get Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Then you get huge lockdowns in key manufacturing regions of China because Omicron is hitting China very hard now. And so if you were hoping that what was going to happen was supply was going to normalize, now all of a sudden it looks like it won’t. So I want to talk a bit about those risks and how they change the outlook. What does Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mean for the global economic outlook?  larry summers  With your permission, I’ll interrupt to say that I don’t think the characterization of where things were prior to these shocks was hugely plausible. It wasn’t hugely plausible because the forecasts were all for unemployment to keep falling. They were all for growth to be faster than the economy’s potential. They weren’t terribly plausible because, in a sense, wages are the ultimate measure of core inflation. Most costs go back to labor. And so who knows what’s going to happen to used car prices, who knows what’s going to happen in some month to semiconductor prices or to the price of asparagus. But in some sense the growth rate of wages is what ultimately is determining inflation over time. And wage growth had ratcheted up to a 6-plus percent rate by the end of the year. And there were desperate labor shortages, worse than we’ve ever had. And they were forecast to continue. And the response that, frankly, the progressives who had advocated all of this were saying was that this labor shortage was fantastic because it was going to lead to even more wage increases for workers. So the theory of how this was all going to work out to moderate inflation with even lower unemployment, it would all make sense if there was an element of wage restraint. But when it was all happening with accelerating wage growth, I found it difficult, even before what we have seen, to see the scenario to soft landing. Just as in the 1970s, excessively inflationary policies were followed by bad luck, and just as in the 1970s, the authors of the expansionary policies chose to interpret all the problems as being a consequence of the bad luck, even though some of it was a consequence of their policies. I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have significantly higher inflation this year because of the increase in oil prices, and because of the increase in food prices, and because of what’s happened in China. The long-predicted return to normal in used car prices, for example, is now substantially deferred. The big question is whether the increase we’re going to have this year is going to feed through into medium-term inflation expectations or whether it’s not. And the good news— and this is highlighted by Paul Krugman and others— and they make an important point is that as of right now people are forecasting way accelerated inflation for this year. The market forecast is close to 6 percent. But they’re still forecasting more limited inflation beyond. And the question is, what’s going to happen to those inflation expectations? And the reason I felt that it was so important for the Fed to send strong signals of its determination to contain inflation, even with increases in unemployment, if that’s necessary, is that that I think will ultimately make it much easier to contain inflation than if we allow high inflation expectations to become entrenched. It’s precisely because it hasn’t happened yet that I think it is so important to be sending strong signals right now.  ezra klein  Before we get to Russia and China for a minute, I want to untangle something here that may not be totally intuitive to people. So there is inflation as a tangible, noticeable phenomenon that we are living through right now. There is inflation, as you mentioned, that can come from people are buying too much and we don’t have enough of the thing they want to buy or the things they want to buy. There’s inflation that can come from there is some kind of supply problem, and as such we are raising prices or rationing the good because we can’t make enough of it. Then there’s this other thing, which is what economists worry more about, which is inflation expectations, which is when the tangible inflationary phenomena we’re seeing right now become something people assume will happen far into the future. And so corporations begin building price increases into their planning, wage negotiations begin tying themselves to inflation, and then you get into a kind of spiral. So can you say a bit about what turns inflation from an economic phenomenon into this psychological economic phenomenon? How does inflation become an expectation? And I guess why does it matter when it does?  larry summers  We don’t really know and we don’t really completely understand the process. But I think a consensus view would be that people learn from the past, because what else would you learn from? And so people form their expectations based on what they’ve observed recently and based on what they think is going to happen in the future. And so when they look around them and they see that people’s wages have been going up at 6 percent or 7 percent, and they see that prices have been going up rapidly, they tend to think, gosh, just in order to stay still, since I’m only going to get a wage increase once a year, I better get that wage increase at 6 percent or 7 percent, otherwise I’m not going to stand still. And when their boss thinks about what wage increase to give them, they think, oh my god, this guy’s pretty valuable, I better not let him leave. And so I better pay him enough to satisfy him. And besides that, it’s probably going to be OK because we’ve been raising prices every couple of months and looks like we’re able to do that. We’re able to make our price increases stick. So I’ll be able to raise prices. So the whole thing becomes sort of self-fulfilling. A little bit like if you want to gain ground walking next to a treadmill, you have to walk faster and faster as the treadmill gets faster. So that’s the kind of process. Economists used to think that it was just the kind of trade-off that you talked about before. If we would just live with a little more inflation, we could have lower unemployment and that would do so much for social justice. That was the prevailing macroeconomic theory of the 1960s. And that theory ended in the stagflation of the 1970s where we got the inflation, we got the acceleration in inflation, and we didn’t get any enduring benefit in terms of lower unemployment. And so that’s when economists revised their theory. That’s when credibility became so important. That’s what led Paul Volcker to be celebrated. And that’s why we’ve had 40 years when the problems have not been of the inflation overheat variety. That when we’ve had downturns, they’ve had to do with a different subject— huge problems in the financial sector. And that’s really what the crucial issue is today. Are we going to keep things under control or are we going to allow expectations to fully increase and create a need to do again what Paul Volcker did, at enormous cost, from 1979 to 1982. Most people don’t remember it today, but unemployment got to a much higher level in 1982 than it reached even during the financial crisis of 2008.  ezra klein  And so just real quick, Paul Volcker, being the Federal Reserve Chair who jacked up interest rates to— I believe it was 19 percent— engineering a massive, although very quick recession, and break in the back of inflation. But I want to go back to what we were talking about a second ago, which is going back to the story and the way people were looking at it, I understand one of the divisions between Larry Summers and people who disagreed with Larry Summers over the past year. The people who disagreed with you, believing that the pandemic period was more of a special case, that it was an artificial constraint on supply, that that constraint would lift more quickly. That we were in this kind of one to two to three-ish, maybe, year period where things were going to be very weird, weirder than maybe we had hoped, but we were going to get out of it. And without getting into the question here of whether they were right, one of the things that struck me as important from the expectations view on this is that if you believed that, then the reason you might not expect inflation that we’re seeing now to persist in five years or in 10 years is because you expect the pandemic to be more or less settled by then. One of the things that worries me about the moment we’re in is that other ways the world might just be continuously different are emerging. So I want to talk a bit about Russia-Ukraine on that dimension, but also the way the pandemic is just, particularly in Asia, maybe going to have a very different life cycle than was projected if you’re in the West. And if people begin to think the world is different in the future in a way that feeds into inflation, I mean then your expectations become a real problem. But let’s begin here for a bit with Russia and Ukraine. What do you understand the consequences on the near and slightly longer-term global economy to be from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?  larry summers  I think the near-term impact is $25 or $30 a barrel higher oil prices, and the equivalent with respect to grains, and significant increases also with respect to a range of other commodities. I think that’s a meaningful contributor to the inflation process, perhaps a 1 and a half percentage points, perhaps a little more, perhaps a little bit less, coming at a time when we already had an inflation problem. How severe it is will depend upon how long commodity prices remain elevated. It will depend upon how big the spike in commodity prices is. I think the developments in China, which suggest continuing interruptions in supply of a whole variety of goods have a reasonable chance of being with us for as much as another year. I think one of the general principles to have is that things take longer than you think they will and then they happen faster than you thought they could. And so I suspect that relief is going to be slower in terms of supply chains than people expect. But I do think that at some point, it will come in the future. And then all of this is going to make the task of containing inflation that much more difficult. People are going to look and they’re going to say, let’s see, my neighbor got a 6 percent wage increase. Things looked awfully expensive at the grocery store. The gas prices are way up. I read in the paper that they’re closing down Shanghai. But maybe this is all temporary and so inflation is going to come down and so I shouldn’t ask for a big wage increase. Seems like everybody’s going to plan for the worst and hope for the best. And that’s going to mean wanting higher wage increases and wanting higher price increases, unless there’s some strong counter-pressure to that. And the strong counter-pressure has to be less money floating around and a sense that there may be excess supply caused by a reduction in demand. And so I think the vision that has been held out— that with no reduction in demand we can somehow get inflation down in the midst of this— was unlikely prior to the recent supply shocks and is now extremely unlikely.  ezra klein  So the counterargument you’ll hear to this is that as much as telling the grimmer story makes sense to you, to me, the subject of the show, actually, that there is a place where you can look to see if, particularly, markets are telling the grimmer story. And as you gestured at, they’re really not yet— at least not yet. So one-year inflation expectations have shot up. But you look at three, you look at five, you look at 10-year expectations, they haven’t moved all that much. And so the idea is if the long-term market expectations haven’t moved, maybe we don’t need to slam the brakes on the economy so hard. Maybe people aren’t telling that longer story and they’re still open to this being as the now buried adjective goes— transient.  larry summers  So, look, Ezra, I’d love for all that stuff to be true. I spent 20 years pushing various kinds of strongly Keynesian theories that were directed at the idea that we should promote demand more and promote demand permanently. I was one of the prominent people pushing the idea of secular stagnation, which was a whole theory about how we should need more demand. So these are ideas that are emotionally very attractive to me. But I think you have to look at the facts. And the facts are that if you look at five-year expected inflation right now, it is about 3 and a half percent, detached from the 2 percent target. And if you look at 10-year expected inflation, it is at close to 3 percent. So we actually are a bit detached from our target levels of inflation, point one. Point two— and this is the key point— the Fed has done more signaling of tightening in the last two months than any time in the last 40 years. So the only reason why we have kept inflation expectations under control is that belatedly the Fed has done the things that those of us who are anxious about inflation were recommending for the past nine months. And the Fed has moved to rejecting the advice of the people who were serene. If the monetary policy recommendations contained in Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech in August, or your colleague, Paul Krugman’s recommendations through the fall had been adhered to, we would have much higher inflation expectations today. Now, I think the Fed has adjusted quite significantly. I think it has adjusted insufficiently to the new reality, which is why I think what we’re likely to see is inflation expectations rising. And we’re likely to see further evidence of Fed tightening. But let’s not confuse massive Fed signaling of tightening. The Fed going from saying that it was not going to raise interest rates at all until 2024, which was their position a year ago, to saying that they’re going to raise interest rates to 2 percent in 2022— let’s not say that expectations have become anchored and that’s some kind of triumph for team transitory. That’s evidence on the efficacy of the recommendations of those of us who felt that the Fed should have begun the tightening much sooner.  ezra klein  And I think at this point, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell has said that’s true. That they should have begun sooner. He, I think, said that over the last week. I think the question now is how tight? And I want to make sure we get into what tightening is, because I worry sometimes we use language that is a little too bloodless in all this. But you’re still pretty unhappy with them. Some of the people have been more aligned with you. So Jason Furman, say, he seemed pretty happy with the Fed. He said that they were going in the direction he thought they should go. You wrote this column where you blasted them for, quote, “wishful and delusional thinking,” particularly in their economic forecasting. And I want to sit in that space of economic forecasting for a minute. So why? Why do you think what they are saying is going to happen doesn’t make economic sense?  larry summers  Because they are predicting that the unemployment rate is going to fall to 3 and a half percent, remain at 3 and a half percent for three years, and that while that’s happening inflation is going to fall from its current north of 6 percent level to the neighborhood of 2 percent. And nothing like that has ever happened in the last, roughly, 60 years. There have only been very rare occasions when unemployment has fallen below 4 percent. And when that has happened, inflation has accelerated rather than decelerated. So I think they’re postulating a set of circumstances that have never come together at a moment when it’s particularly difficult for those circumstances to come together. De facto unemployment is more like 2 percent than like 3 and a half percent if you take account of what’s happening to vacancies. Supply shock pressures are much greater than they were in the previous historical episodes when we had low unemployment. So I think the combined idea that we’re going to have 3 and a half percent unemployment for the next three years and that while that’s happening inflation is going to decline substantially is not something that is supported by anything in the relevant economic history, nor is it consistent at all with market inflation expectations, which are substantially greater than what they’re forecasting, nor is it consistent with what one can infer from the market about unemployment expectations, which is significantly higher unemployment than they’re forecasting. I think that it is hard to see the forecast as anything other than— to use an old political term— rosy scenario economics. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  You’ve said, in an interview, that we’re going to need 4 percent to 5 percent interest rates, levels we’re not even thinking of as conceivable. When you say that, at what time-frame are you thinking about that? Are you saying they should be going to 4 percent to 5 percent by the end of 2022? You’re saying that they’ll be there by the end of 2024? Tell me about that prediction.  larry summers  First of all, Ezra, I just want to emphasize that I am always careful to say what I think is likely or what I think is the preponderant probability, never to say that I know what’s going to happen. And there are always a variety of reasons that I try to keep in mind and to watch for why I could be wrong. My basis is simply this— we think about the effects of monetary policy in terms of what economists call real interest rates— interest rates minus the rate of inflation. And the idea is that when real interest rates go up, people want to save more, people want to spend less, because capital is more expensive. And so in order to restrain the economy, you have to raise the level of real interest rates. Real interest rates right now over every horizon are substantially negative. Not just over one year. Not just over five years. They’re actually negative over 30 years.  ezra klein  Can you say, just because I think it’s unintuitive, what it means for a real interest rate to be negative?  larry summers  A real interest rate to be negative means that if I buy a bond, the money I will get back from the bond will have less purchasing power than the money that I put into the bond. If the interest rate were negative, that would mean I get less money back than I put into the bond. If the real interest rate— that is the interest rate adjusted for purchasing power— is negative, that means I get less purchasing power, less ability to buy things back. And so when you have an economy where you can get more for your money today than you can if you put it aside or where you can borrow money at lower cost than you’re going to have to pay back when the bond comes due, that’s an economy that’s going to encourage spending today, and it’s going to encourage spending today at a substantial rate. I don’t think we’re going to avoid and bring down the rate of inflation until we get to positive real interest rates. And I don’t think we’re going to get to positive real interest rates without, over the next couple of years, getting interest rates north of 4 percent. What happens to real interest rates depends both on what the Fed does and on what happens to inflation. My sense of this is that given the likely paths of inflation, we’re likely to have a need for nominal interest rates, basic Fed interest rates, to rise to the 4 percent to 5 percent range over the next couple of years. If they don’t do that, I think we’ll get higher inflation. And then over time, it will be necessary for them to get to still higher levels and cause even greater dislocations. As I wrote in that column you mentioned, Paul Volcker would not have had to do what he did if others earlier had taken stronger steps to contain inflation. And the 10.8 percent unemployment that America suffered in 1982 was something that was completely avoidable if we had been prepared to take prompter action. It was something that was completely avoidable if we had not sought to blame inflation on a range of specific issues rather than on the overall level of demand in the economy.  ezra klein  Do you think the level of Fed tightening that you’re talking about would demand a recession or do you think at this point the path is possible to slow inflation without actually putting the economy into recession?  larry summers  I think the likelihood is that we will not return to 2 percent inflation without having at least a mild recession. I think that the magnitude of the imbalances and excess demand in the labor market are sufficiently great that the odds are probably three and four that we will not get inflation down without running a recession. Here’s a simple fact for your listeners to consider— if you look at the last 75 years of American business cycle history and you just ask the question— suppose that the unemployment rate is below 4 and the inflation rate is above 4, what are the odds that the economy will go into a recession in the next year and what are the odds that the economy will go into recession in the next two years? Depending on just how you calculate the answer, it’s about 50 percent that it will go in the next year and about 75 percent that it will go in in the next two years.  ezra klein  One of the things we’ve heard from the Biden administration has been a view that, of course, we need to do a lot on inflation, but the correct way to do it— recognizing the Fed has its own job here— but the Biden administration has said and Biden himself has said, what we really want to do is try to rapidly increase supply. And I think you’re hearing that more a couple of months ago than you’re hearing that right now. But that rather than putting the brakes on demand, rather than slowing the economy down, rather than potentially cutting a lot of people off from gains they could have made, is there some way that we can open up the gates on supply quickly such that there’s more of the things people need and inflation goes down from that direction? Do you think the government has the tools to affect supply dramatically on the one to two-year time-frame?  larry summers  Mostly the tools are pretty limited. And the tools that there are are tools that the Biden administration has so far been very reluctant to adopt. If we reduce tariffs, that would make more goods available at lower prices and perhaps reduce the consumer price index by 1 percent or more. But their rhetoric has gone the other way on tariffs. If we decided to do public procurement as inexpensively as possible, that would reduce prices of a whole set of things the government buys and increase competitive pressure. But we’ve instead indicated a desire to shift from buying cheap to buying America and buying in ways that protect certain key constituencies. If we acted to reduce various regulatory restrictions— we took away requirements that people be licensed to cut other people’s hair, or we allowed foreign companies to ship things from Houston to Newark, or we allowed foreign airlines to fly people from Boston to Los Angeles as a continuation of a flight coming from Europe— all these kinds of things would operate in very short runs to reduce prices. I don’t think the effects would be large. I don’t think it’s remotely realistic to think that programs of public investment are going to increase supply in a relevant horizon for the current inflation.  ezra klein  One of the questions that I think should be more front and center in politics than it is is raising interest rates sharply, which to some degree is going to happen over the next couple of years, whether on your path or on another. It’s a pretty blunt tool. In fact, it’s a very blunt tool. And, of course, the people who get hurt worst are the people who always get hurt worst. Are there ways to protect them? Are there ways to more progressively slow the economy down? You don’t hear people talking in these moments about progressive consumption taxes, which are hard to do quickly but are not an impossible idea. You don’t hear people talking about ways to soften the blow at the bottom ends. Are there ways to do that? Can we put restraint on the economy without the people who actually bear the burden of the strain most being the people who have also borne the burden of our economic failures the most?  larry summers  Let me say a couple of things about that. First, I’ll say the hard edge things, then I’ll say some things that perhaps will seem less hard edge to you. Interest rates had their greatest impact on long-lived investments. And that kind of makes sense. We’ve got a big housing stock. What happens to one year’s housing spending doesn’t have nearly as big an effect on the availability of housing as what happens to one year’s asparagus. Production does. So interest rates are a tool targeted at different categories of spending in response to how long-lived they are, which is exactly the way you would want to organize things. I think the question of interest rates and distribution is a very complicated one. Interest rate increases tend to have, as their major impact— a major impact— declines in asset prices. And assets are disproportionately held by the most wealthy people in the society. So I don’t think that interest rates are quite as poorly designed a tool for applying economic restraint as the tone of your question suggested. I think if you want to apply economic restraint, interest rates are actually a pretty good way to do it. And the evidence is that changes in the interest rates have much more impact on the investment opportunities of wealthy people than they do on the payday loans received by poor people that actually aren’t that sensitive to changes in Fed interest rates. Of course, when we have downturns, we should extend unemployment insurance, and have more automatic stabilizers, and do a set of things. So I wouldn’t necessarily say that interest rates are such a bad countercyclical tool. I would say that you’re completely right— and this is something I’ve advocated for a long time— that we need a much more progressive tax system in the United States. But I would be hesitant about the excessive embrace of fiscal policy as a tool of countercyclical management. It is difficult to move spending up and down quickly. Temporary tax changes on wealthy people almost all economists will tell you will not have large effects on the level of spending.  ezra klein  Let me give you then another question where you’ll like the underlying assumptions even less. So one of the arguments being made on the left is that part of what is driving inflation right now is that corporations are using this moment almost as cover to make pretty significant pricing increases. So if you look back to say 2019, non-financial corporations had roughly a trillion dollars in profits. That had been more or less stable for a while. By 2021, they were a lot closer to $2 trillion. So there’s a lot going wrong in the economy but corporations are making a lot of money in it. And while what you do about this is hard— I’m not here advocating for price controls— is there legitimacy, or at least how do you answer the view that part of what’s going on here is we’re now going to slow down the economy because corporations have taken this moment to squeeze people for what they’re worth and that that should strike people as unfair and strike people’s demanding a response.  larry summers  Maybe an alternative way of understanding this is I’m a furniture store, and at my furniture store there used to only be a few customers. And if I raised my prices, I’d have even fewer customers and my inventory would sit. And now I’m having difficulty keeping my inventory stocked because there’s so many people in my store demanding new furniture. And so in order to keep supply and demand balanced, I raise prices more than I used to. And so I’m able to raise prices now because there’s so much demand. So I think that the way to understand a business person who says they have pricing power is not that somehow they now feel they can be greedy where before they couldn’t be greedy. It’s that economic conditions mean that the supply-demand balance has tilted in their favor. And there’s evidence, for my view— I would cite the fact that inventories fell to super low levels. I would cite the fact that they were experiencing more and more lags and inability to get deliveries. I would cite the fact that their costs were increasing substantially in terms of labor costs. And that they were seeing that happen to all their competitors as well. So if I raised my price before by 10 percent, everybody would have gone to the store next door. But today, in a world of excess demand, that’s not true. So I think the way one has to understand the inflation is as reflecting the tendency to have more demand. If you take the most basic introductory economics model of an industry that we teach, it has as a central element that as demand increases, prices rise, and that as demand increases particularly egregiously, supply is limited in the short run and so prices rise more. So I think it’s, frankly, ridiculous to take businesses saying on a earnings call that they have pricing power as some kind of evidence of perfidy. I just don’t think that is supported by any serious understanding of how the business process works. And by the way, another way of looking at this is, again, to look at what’s happening to wages. Wage inflation is as pronounced a phenomenon as price inflation. And we don’t think workers have huge pricing power. Or another way to look at this is as relations in terms of what Amazon is paying its suppliers or what Walmart is paying its suppliers. Surely if there’s market power in the relationship between Walmart and its suppliers or between Amazon and its suppliers, the power is on the side of Amazon and Walmart. And they’re paying much higher prices to their suppliers. So are there market power problems in the American economy? Yes. Is it a good idea to attack those problems? Yes. Is it fine if we use the motivation provided by inflation to do some of that? Yes. Does it make any sense at all to blame inflation on market power? No. That’s not serious economic reasoning and the judgments and forecasts of those who engage in that reasoning should be taken less seriously as a consequence. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  So we talked a few minutes ago about how the federal government doesn’t have very good tools to work with supply on the one to two-year time-frame. But this more they can do to expand it or also change the kind of supply the economy offers on the five, 10, 15-year time-frame. A good example being investments in green energy. If you send the right signals and make the right investments, you can create a lot more green energy in 10 years than you would have had otherwise. There are a number of these investments in the legislative package, maybe formerly known as Build Back Better. But inflation risk has become very much part of why folks like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have shot it down. Do you think that’s the right way to think about Build Back Better? That it’s something we should not do because there is higher inflation now. Or do you think there are real ways we can increase the supply of the economy in 10 years and these should be seen as non-contradictory?  larry summers  Ezra, the record is clear. I endorsed Build Back Better. I re-endorsed Build Back Better. I was a strong supporter of Build Back Better for exactly the reason you say that I think there are a set of fundamental investments that we need to make in our economy that start from infrastructure and include a range of human investments. There are ways in which I think the design could be better. I’d like to see emphasis on efficiency and building infrastructure as well as more money into infrastructure, for example. But I was a strong supporter of Build Back Better. I did think we should design it so that it didn’t represent a net contribution to demand in the first few years for the reasons that you were talking about earlier, that I didn’t want too much burden to fall on monetary policy. But my view is that we should pay for fundamental public investments that are worth it, that there are a lot of fundamental public investments that are worth it, that have very high returns. That many of the ways of raising revenue probably would be good ideas even if we didn’t need the money, such as improving tax compliance. So I’m very much with the general orientation of the progressives on that in believing that there are a whole set of public investments that would be very, very valuable for us to make, and I think will over time increase the capacity of the economy.  ezra klein  What is not being considered as a policy proposal, including quite big ones, that you think would do the most to increase supply on the 10 or 15-year time-frame? If you want either productive capacity to be bigger in 10 years or prices to be lower in 10 years, and you could put anything into the window of political possibility that is not currently there, what would it be?  larry summers  I think probably the greatest scope in the horizon that you spoke about, Ezra, is probably immigration policy, where if we could find a way to admit substantially more, particularly, but not only, high-skilled immigrants into the country, I think the benefits in terms of growth would really be very substantial. I also think there are a variety of jobs where we could contain costs without doing damage to the interests of working Americans by enhanced immigration. And so finding a better synthesis on immigration policy that allowed more immigration and probably involved more insistence on the Americanization of immigrants would, I think, be something that would be very desirable. Second, I think that we as a country have under-invested substantially in place-based policies. I think that we have red hot markets in some places— the places where you live and the places where I live. And we have rather stone cold markets in a variety of other places. And I don’t think we’ve applied enough imagination about how we could shift demand from the red hot places to the stone cold places. I think if we did that, we would do an enormous amount of good in the stone cold places. And I think we would also enable there to be more total demand with less total pressure on prices. Third, I think the risks that we are under-investing in technology vastly exceed the risks that we are over-investing in technology. And I think we are way under-spending on fundamental research as a country, and by doing that are shortchanging one of our most fundamental strengths as a country. So those would probably be the three places that are not right at the edge of the horizon that I would emphasize.  ezra klein  On the place-based policy idea, what do you think about the idea that comes up every so often, which I’ve always been somewhat partial to, that the federal government should break more of its agencies across the country. Department of Transportation— you can be in Indiana somewhere. Department of Commerce can be in Kentucky. Department— I mean, I’m just pulling places out of thin air here. But that instead of it all being concentrated in Washington D.C., that one thing that could generate a lot of activity in different places, and the government actually does have control over it, is where some of its important high-wage, high-labor force and also just economically activating functions go.  larry summers  Of course, we do have one part of the government that in a way does that, which is the Defense Department. Because if you look at the location of our military bases, the military bases don’t tend to be in the places that you or I would most naturally think about living, Ezra. And I think that probably is on net a positive thing from which we derive economic benefit. I am basically sympathetic to the idea and think that we probably do too little of it rather than too much of it. I think there are three problems that you have to recognize as you go in this direction. One is some places it’s going to be hard. When I was at Treasury, we had some kind of center for resisting cyber financial crime that was headquartered, because of political pressure and because of these kinds of arguments, somewhere in Western Pennsylvania. Well, it just turned out to be kind of hard to get people who were great at cyber things to go to Western Pennsylvania and live and work at that center. And so I’m not sure the innovation was on net successful. Second, as the military bases suggest, once you do it, it’s very hard to change it. And so you have to think very hard about that. Third, I think you have to think about the synergies and the dis-synergies associated with isolation. When these things get into the political process, you don’t always get the most rational outcomes. I was very much impressed by a study I read some years ago— I don’t remember who did it— by some political scientists who looked at the degree of corruption in states where the state capital was a major city, like Boston, and states where the state capital was an otherwise periphery kind of place, like Albany, New York. And the evidence was very strong. The government was more dysfunctional and corruption was greater when you had isolated state capitals. And I think that is just something one needs to be cautious about in thinking about this. But could we do more of it? Yes, we could.  ezra klein  We’ve talked a lot about monetary policy and the rate of interest rate increases over the year. But if you were advising the president— and it could be Joe Biden or the hypothetical president— as to how to build a policy and a message agenda for 2022, a year where you have all of the economic problems that gathered force in 2021 now running into Russia or running into China, what would it be? What is the political either argument or actual proposals that seem to you, on the executive side, merited for the moment?  larry summers  First of all, since I tend not to think so well of the economics that’s embodied in a lot of political people’s advice, I have the symmetrical humility to recognize that perhaps people should not pay great attention to my political advice, but instead should give more weight to my views about what economic science says about what the consequences of policies will be and undertake their own political evaluations. It seems to me, though, that if there is a silver lining in what has happened in the global arena over the last couple of years— I mean that to embrace both the pandemic challenge, and what has happened in Ukraine, and rising concerns about China, and the continuing threat of global climate change. It seems to me if there’s any silver lining in any of that, it is to make an argument that goes back to what might be called a Kennedy-esque tradition of national unity around national challenges. The words that inspired me when they were explained to me when I was in first grade about ask not what you can do for your country— what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. It seems to me that points to an emphasis on public investment, that points to an emphasis on unity and inclusion as a source of strength and excellence, that points to an emphasis on competitiveness and the need for competitiveness as a motivation for collaboration. And it points, I think, away from more divisive agendas. It points towards cooperation between business and government in the solution of problems rather than vilification of profiteers. It points towards calling on people to do their part rather than asking what you can deliver directly for them. I’m struck by two public opinion poll findings. I’m struck by the fact that those cash payments that were fought after and were seen as so politically central have been forgotten and were little lamented when they disappeared. And I’m struck that when you ask the American people are you prepared to pay higher gas prices in order to sanction Putin, they overwhelmingly answer the question yes. And so I think a sense of collective endeavor that appeals to the most contributing instincts that people have, rather than a sense of delivering for constituencies, is the direction I would want to take that conversation.  ezra klein  And then always our final question— what are three books that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience?  larry summers  I was very much influenced— some would probably say I didn’t absorb the message well enough— by David Halberstam’s “The Best and the Brightest” as an avocation of how the well-intentioned but overconfident, and overly dogmatic, and unwilling to hear contrary evidence led to disastrous outcomes. Second, I was very influenced by Zachary Carter’s recent biography of Keynes, which I think demonstrates that ideas and even economic models ultimately, and over time, have larger impacts than maneuvers and machinations in small rooms, despite the fact that the latter seem more important at any particular moment in time. And third, a book that will come out in the next several months, Brad DeLong’s “Slouching Towards Utopia,” which is, I think, a really remarkable and powerful placing of all of economic history in perspective, that gives a sense that at some level I had known but never appreciated of how profoundly different the 20th century was than all other centuries and points towards the combined power of science and markets to change the world profoundly, and sometimes, in some ways, for good, and sometimes, in some ways, for ill. I think anybody who wants to propound about economic policy should read that book.  ezra klein  I feel like I’ve been waiting for Brad’s big economic history opus for a long time now. So I will agree that I’m very excited for that one to hit my desk. Larry Summers, thank you very much.  larry summers  Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]  ezra klein  That’s the show.

The telecom giant confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that its customers had been targeted by the rogue texts offering them a free gift, which were reported on Monday by The Verge, a technology news website. Some users had reported being forwarded to Russian state media sites when they clicked on links in the texts, but Verizon was treating the texts as a more typical phishing scheme aimed at defrauding consumers.  “As part of a recent fraud scheme, bad actors have been sending text messages to some Verizon customers which appear to come from the customers’ own number,” the statement said. “Our company has significantly curtailed this current activity, but virtually all wireless providers have faced similar fraudulent activity in recent months.”  The scheme highlighted a steady rise in the number of complaints filed with the federal government by consumers who said that they were the victims of spam text messages.  In response to follow-up questions on Wednesday, a Verizon spokesman said that the company believed that several thousand of its customers had received the texts as part of a broader scheme affecting major wireless carriers.  The spokesman, Rich Young, said that Verizon had blocked one of the numbers that sent some of the messages, but that the source was continuing to use other numbers to spam customers.  There was no indication, Mr. Young said, that the messages came from Russia, which has become suspected of carrying out cyberattacks amid that country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  According to Verizon, it was working with the F.B.I. and the U.S. Secret Service to identify the source of the texts, which enticed recipients to click on a link offering them a free gift. Security experts generally advise against clicking on links sent from strange or unrecognized accounts.  The intent of the fraudulent solicitations is to get people to enter their credit card information, Mr. Young said. Clicking on the link would not have likely exposed those customers’ cellphones to malware, he added.  The F.B.I. declined to comment on Wednesday, as did the Secret Service.  T-Mobile said in an email on Wednesday that it had found no evidence of its customers receiving the text messages, but that it had added the known links identified as part of the fraud scheme to its spam-blocking filters.  An AT&T spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that the company was closely monitoring the situation, but had not seen anything similar on its network.  In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission said that it received 377,840 reports of fraud stemming from text message solicitations, with losses totaling $131 million. The median amount lost was $900, according to the commission.  Cellphone users can report suspicious text messages by copying messages and forwarding them to the number 7726, which spells SPAM, a reporting service that was created by the GSMA, a wireless consortium whose members include Verizon.  Most smartphones include features for blocking unwanted calls and text messages. To try to keep telemarketers and other solicitors at bay, consumers can also add their numbers to a federal do-not-call registry.  But those barriers haven’t stopped fraudsters from trying to bait cellphone users to relinquish financial information and other personal data with offers that include free gifts. Some fraudulent texts invite the recipients to click on links with tracking updates for fictitious shipments.  Suspect text messages should be treated with the same heightened vigilance as suspect emails, one cybersecurity expert said on Wednesday.  “Don’t click on the links, especially if something doesn’t seem right,” said Tim Weber, security services director for ADNET Technologies in Rocky Hill, Conn. “On the surface they seem to be like phishing emails.”  Mr. Weber advised people to use built-in security features on smartphones to prevent them from being compromised, including biometric locks — those using thumbprints or facial recognition — and two-factor authentication.

I learned that more cases than usual were being reported in a city in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where skirmishes between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian Army had left the area war-ravaged long before the full-scale invasion currently strangling the country. A gynecologist in Avdiivka, a suburb of Donetsk, told The New York Times that the uptick in cases was most likely due to a combination of stress and heavy lifting; damage to pipes and other infrastructure forced residents to carry pails of water up flights of stairs. One woman with the condition, Liudmila, said she now had to decide between an expensive medical procedure and repairing her roof, which had been destroyed by shelling. “The winter is coming,” she said, “and I am going to stay either without a roof over my head or with my uterus falling out.”  In “Lucky Breaks,” a newly translated short-story collection by the Ukrainian writer and photographer Yevgenia Belorusets, battle scars are more often psychological than physical. Her characters, much like Liudmila, have not been afforded the time or space to attend to the shocks of war; life, or something like it, must go on for these women. Many are internal refugees who fled the brutal fighting that first broke out in east Ukraine in 2014, and have resettled in a Kyiv that regards them with apathy or suspicion. Rarely do we get the details of what happened to these women in the Donbas; Belorusets smartly conveys the invisibility of their trauma by making it likewise invisible to readers. In the Kyiv metro, we meet a jovial woman named Xenia who appears enthusiastic about her new career selling stationery on the subway. Advertising double-sided markers, she yells to the passengers, “They highlight the main idea!” When someone shoots her a dirty look, her veneer of happiness rapidly disintegrates, and she collapses. The narrator makes vague reference to “all the other sorrows that had vexed her over the last two years,” without explaining what they are, because, after all, no one has bothered to ask.  Image  Given the timing of “Lucky Breaks,” it might be tempting to describe these stories as urgent. The irony is that at the time of writing (the book was first published in 2018), Belorusets was in fact turning her attention to an overlooked population — poor women in Ukraine’s industrial east — within an overlooked conflict. Before Russia’s invasion in February, over 14,000 people had already died in clashes in the Donbas, and a million and a half had been displaced. Today, amid blanket media coverage of the war, the sense of forgottenness that permeates the emotional landscape of “Lucky Breaks” is jarring. A beloved manicurist goes missing, but no one notices at first; another woman disappears into a forest.

Gossett/The New York Times  大约在同一时间，另一项帮助新移民熟悉社区道路的努力正在酝酿：作为联络华埠与纽约市政机构为数不多的地方组织之一，美国华商会向纽约市公共运输局提出请求，为华埠制作、放置双语路标，“让成千上万华人新移民生活更轻松，”时报在1969年报道称，“这些人在抵美之初对英语或拉丁字母知之甚少。”  华埠影响力不断提升，引发了与邻近社区的冲突。 1985年，中文报纸《世界日报》报道称， 双语路标曾在多年前引来带有种族主义动机的蓄意破坏和暴力事件，“意（大利）裔青年甚至殴打公路局工作人员”，并“将路牌上中文以黑漆涂抹”。 Jerry S.Y. Cheng and William E. Sauro/The New York Times  然而，使用“官方”中文街名的想法又引来了一个新问题：该起怎样的中文名呢？虽然中文方言与书面语言（无论简繁）相同，但每个汉字的发音在不同方言中可能会有天壤之别。  上世纪60年代末，华埠的大多数移民都来自中国南部的台山和广州地区。虽然据报道称，最终的中文街名是基于社区提交的意见书，选择了便于持不同方言的移民理解的发音，但定下的街名仍然最清楚地反映了台山话和广东话。  有两种主要译法。 直译法 ：按词义直接翻译成中文，发音与英文原词并无相似。 音译法 : 用中文音译，模仿英文原词的发声，但中文可能没有意义。 多年来，根据译者的不同理解，同一条街道曾被翻译成不同的名字。以下是对东百老汇大街翻译变化的示例。 1958年地图中使用的街名 伊士 “East”的音译法 布律威 “Broadway”的音译法 交通局的现代路标 東 “East”的直译法 百老滙 “Broadway”的音译法 一个中文街名可能有多种读法。 英语中有几个音在中文方言中不存在，这使得有时用汉字重现英文单词会非常困难。此外，一个在粤语中可能听起来与英文街名几乎完全相同的名称，在另一种方言中或许完全不同——与英语街名毫无相似之处。 英语粤语普通话台山话闽方言 且林市果 且林市果 英语粤语普通话台山话闽方言 科西街 科西街 英语粤语普通话台山话闽方言 柏路 柏路 英语粤语普通话台山话闽方言 勿街 勿街 Museum of Chinese in America and Chang W. Lee/The New York Times  上世纪60年代末和70年代初，华埠变得更加多元。来自其他地区的移民越来越多，普通话、闽方言等也在这里迅速蔓延开来。  1968年的勿街。与全美一样，上世纪60年代末的华埠，年轻一代充满政治活力，他们创办了几个活动人士和社区服务机构，这些组织在接下来的半个世纪里塑造了华埠的公民社会。 Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times  虽然这些路标未能呈现出中文方言的多样性，但它们的出现代表了曼哈顿华埠一个突出的新时代，因为这片街区已经发展成为纽约华人繁荣的家园和商业中心。  第三章 1985年：至少在交通局眼中，华埠的规模翻了一番 1987年的勿街。环境卫生部的一个标示牌以中英文双语要求人们减少乱丢垃圾。 Dith Pran/The New York Times  在王清福将报社总部设在咀啉街的一百年后，一位名叫郑向元的年轻城市规划师沿着这条街走下去，想弄清楚且林士果广场周围混乱的交通状况到底是怎么回事。  从王清福抵达华埠到1965年《移民法案》通过，华埠人口已稳步增长至1.5万人。郑向元1969年从台湾移民至此，这里的人口已经开始膨胀，到1985年居民人数达到了7万人。以制衣业和餐饮业为动力，这里的经济迎来了蓬勃发展。生意更好了，商铺更多了，人流量更大，交通也更拥堵了。  1977年的宰也街。 Paul Hosefros/The New York Times  结果，郑向元发现很多人来找他。“他们会带着问题来找我，因为我是华人，”郑向远说。“我认识那些领袖，我能翻译——我就像一座桥梁一样。”  正是在这样的背景下，郑向元结识了中华公所主席李立波。中华公所是约60个团体组成的一个社群组织，长期以来一直是华埠的非官方（尽管经常存在争议）治理机构。  路标上的手写字体。 路标上的汉字由当地著名书法家谭炳忠亲笔书写。据当时的中文媒体报道，“他的笔法遒劲有力，为实用性的路标注入了艺术气息。”虽然时任纽约市长郭德华(Edward I. Koch)没有出席1985年官方路标的揭幕仪式，但他给谭炳忠写了一封私人的感谢信。 New York City Department of Transportation and Chang W. Lee/The New York Times 细节差异使每个汉字都独一无二。 因为每一个中文街名都是谭炳忠写下的，细节处处有巧思。每个路标上几乎都有“街”一字，但每个“街”字都有一些细微不同。 Chang W. Lee/The New York Times  1984年，李立波致电郑向元讨论路标一事。据一些估计，当时华埠的地理范围已经增加了一倍，开始包括以往被认为是小意大利、包厘街和下东区的地方。当尼克松总统在1972年访华和美中关系破冰之后，每年来到这里的说普通话和福建话的移民越来越多。  在郑向元的帮助下，中华公所向交通局提交了意见书，要求拓展双语街名项目，以适应该地区的发展。  “交通局并没有太多的反对，”时任副局长的戴维·古林说。“社区要求设立这些路标，这也算是与人方便。”  唯一的争议是，这些中文路标的使用范围，也就是华埠的边界到底应该在哪里。交通局似乎对华埠范围进行过为期两个月的研究，但研究结果大概率已经遗失。  该项目的记录已丢失、毁坏或残缺。 这张地图（无符号表、图例或脚注）和其他零散的记录似乎表明，向北至布鲁姆街、向西至拉法叶街之间的街道都曾考虑设置双语路标。但参与该项目的在世者都无法给出确切答案。 Broome Street 图中标出的就是交通局可能考虑过设置双语路标的街道。 Allen Street Canal Street Baxter Street Pike Street 圈出区域中都设置了双语路标。 Madison Street Broome Street 图中标出的就是交通局可能考虑过设置双语路标的街道。 Allen Street Canal Street Baxter Street Pike Street Madison Street 圈出区域中都设置了双语路标。 New York City Department of Transportation  当我问郑向元他是否还记得可能会有什么记录保存下来时，他大笑了起来。“不，不，我不认为会有，”他说。“我不认为还会有多少记录留下来。基本所有参与过的人都过世了。”  我们知道，一旦设置双语路标的街道确定下来，下一个障碍就又是该如何选择中文名称。这一次，做决定的人换成了中华公所一个由企业主、业主和长期居民构成的委员会，这些人主要讲台山话和粤语。  曾做过城市规划师的郑向元。他的私人记录和剪报收集帮助我们拼凑出这一独特城市项目的历史脉络。 An Rong Xu for The New York Times  他们当时要为一个与过去完全不同的华埠取街名，但所选街名还是基于台山话和粤语，忽略了华埠的大批新移民。  他们也没有采纳在华埠某些地方的常用通俗街名。比起英文街名，不同时代的中国移民所起的街名更能体现街道特征。比如对于华埠的许多人来说，茂比利街就是尸体街，因为路旁都是殡仪馆、花店和雕像店。许多这样的街名至今仍被华埠居民使用。  现已停刊的华文报纸《北美日报》的一段剪报展示了1985年中华公所总部举行的庆祝双语路标拓展项目完成的仪式。李立波与戴维·古林（前中）合影，旁边是交通局官员彼得·彭尼卡和伊丽莎白·西奥凡。在后排，郑向元位于最右边，左起第二人是谭炳忠。 Jerry S.Y. Cheng  第四章 1985年至今：今日的路标 从曼哈顿大桥鸟瞰东百老汇大街，华埠的这一区域是一个对近几波来自中国福建省移民来说以文化和经济为主的中心。 An Rong Xu for The New York Times  对华裔和华裔美国人来说，华埠仍是充满活力的文化中心，也是华人新移民的落脚点，但这个社区的规模正在缩小。根据2020年人口普查，亚裔是纽约市增长最快的社群。然而，即便定居在布鲁克林和皇后区的人越来越多，华埠还是经历了纽约所有社区中最严重的亚裔居民外流。  这些变迁至少可以追溯到2001年9·11事件的累积效应；袭击的后果对华埠经济造成了巨大打击，特别是餐饮和制衣业。另外，炒房和外商投资推高了租金，再加上最近的新冠疫情导致种族主义言论和暴力事件增多，也令附近商铺生意萧条。  东百老汇大街的一家商铺，这是历史悠久东百老汇购物中心仅剩的少数租铺之一。这座产权属于市政的商场被当地福建人称为怡东楼，是一处重要商业空间，曾容纳大约80家小企业。新冠疫情已导致这里超过四分之三的租铺停业，未来吉凶难卜。 An Rong Xu for The New York Times  近年来，华埠的努力被引向社区组织和示威活动，例如反对金丰大酒楼（一家历史悠久的早茶餐厅，也是华埠最后一家有工会的餐厅）关张，反对在社区中心地段建造新监狱，反对最近的城市重新区划、社区士绅化以及迁移问题。公园和广场处处都能见到反亚裔暴力的抗议活动。在这些人们更为关心的斗争面前，双语路标这样的议题似乎很难再受到关注。  或许这就是很多人还没意识到双语路标也在消失的原因。  华埠现仅存101个双语路标。在该项目的高峰期，至少有155个双语路标被下令印制。在谭炳忠受邀写下的40个街名中，近一半的街道已不再保留任何双语路标。根据交通局副新闻秘书阿拉娜·莫拉莱斯的说法，“中英双语路标不在美国交通运输部《道路交通管理标志统一守则》的要求之中。”这意味着如果双语路标被撞倒或损坏，她表示，“它们将被英文路标替换。”  加萨林街上损坏的双语路标，可能会被替换为纯英文路标。 Chang W. Lee/The New York Times  上世纪80年代参与过双语路标推广的许多人都已去世，维系该项目的压力已经很小。在这座城市看来，这些路标属于一个将会慢慢消失的一次性项目，而不是城市基础设施的永久组成部分。  在如今的华埠，中华总商会和中华公所这样的组织仍有其影响力——例如，当地政客若是寻求华埠支持，它们依然是常规的拜访处。但随着社区多样化，这些组织作为城市与社区之间主要纽带的时代已经过去。  与此同时，许多新的倡导组织已经兴起，提出了新的优先事项，服务华埠的不同群体，重点关注保障性住房、迁移、社区服务和新冠疫情补助等问题。  在接受本文采访之前，当地居民、社区组织者、企业主或学者中没有任何人意识到，这些路标正在消失。

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times  President Biden stepped up pressure on Congress to approve billions of dollars in emergency coronavirus relief aid, using a speech at the White House on Wednesday to warn that U.S. progress against Covid-19 would be at severe risk if Congress failed to act right away.  “This isn’t partisan. It’s medicine,” Mr. Biden said, adding, “Americans are back to living their lives again; we can’t surrender that now. Congress, please act. You have to act immediately.”  On Capitol Hill, senators of both parties said they hoped a deal could be struck before Congress leaves next week for a two-week April recess. Such a deal would likely be $15.6 billion, matching the size of the smaller package that Democrats abruptly removed from a catchall spending bill earlier this month when rank-and-file lawmakers and governors objected to clawing back state aid to help pay for the deal.  It remains unclear how the package will be paid for — a Republican demand that has delayed passage.  “It’s totally up to Democrats,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican. “This can get done, but it’s in their court, and it just requires them to be willing to repurpose some existing funds, which they’re reluctant to do.”  Mr. Biden’s speech on Wednesday was his first dedicated entirely to the pandemic since before his State of the Union address on March 1. It came just one day after federal regulators cleared additional boosters of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for Americans older than 50 and many immunocompromised people, four months after their first booster dose.  At the end of his remarks, the president, 79, rolled up his sleeve to get his second Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot.  Mr. Biden also used his remarks to spotlight a new one-stop-shopping coronavirus website, covid.gov, aimed at helping Americans navigate access to testing, treatment, vaccines and masks, and to assess the risk of Covid-19 in their neighborhoods. The site went live Wednesday morning.  The website, and Mr. Biden’s speech, are part of a broader effort to ease the nation out of pandemic crisis mode and usher in what experts are calling the “next normal” — a phase in which Americans will learn to live with the risk of Covid-19 and to adjust behavior like wearing masks based on whether cases and hospitalizations are rising or falling.  That strategy depends on the availability of vaccines and therapeutics, though, and the administration says it is out of money for both. The White House has been pleading with Republicans in Congress to approve the emergency aid to purchase new vaccines and therapeutics, and to reimburse doctors who care for uninsured Covid-19 patients.  While new coronavirus case have been falling in the United States, a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant known as BA.2 has driven a surge in cases in Europe, and many experts expect that the United States may soon see the same. Should that occur, it will be the first major test of the country’s new strategy of living with the virus while limiting its impact.

In a virtual speech to MPs and senators in Canberra, the Ukrainian president requested Australia send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to assist in the fight against Russia, saying they would “do much more for our common freedom and security than staying parked on your land”.  “You have very good armoured personal vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment that could strengthen our position in terms of armaments,” Zelenskiy said.  Zelenskiy accused Vladimir Putin of “nuclear blackmail” and said that an unchecked Russia was a “threat” to the world, suggesting its actions may inspire other nations to follow suit, in a thinly veiled warning to the parliament he was addressing.  “The distance between our countries is big, it’s thousands of kilometres … but there’s no such thing as distance for the brutality and chaos that Russia brought to the east of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said.  “Whatever is happening in our region because of the Russian aggression … has become a real threat to your country and your people as well,” he said. “This is the nature of the evil. It can instantly cross any distance, any barriers, destroy lives.”  Zelenskiy, clad in his now-signature black T-shirt, spoke via an interpreter on video link to a packed House of Representatives on Thursday night. He called for Russia to pay “the highest price” and for allies to impose even tougher sanctions, such as blocking Russian vessels from foreign ports and boycotting the country’s oil.  Before Zelenskiy’s address, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, called Putin “the war criminal of Moscow” in his strongest condemnation of the Russian president yet.  Morrison also announced an extra $25m in military assistance for Ukraine, including unmanned aerial and ground systems, rations and medical supplies. The commitment takes Australia’s military contributions to Ukraine to $116m.  Earlier on Thursday, the Australian government vowed to slug all imports from Russia and Belarus with an extra 35% tariff.  In a statement, Morrison called out “Russia’s brutal, unrelenting and illegal invasion” of Ukraine, and said the government “will continue to identify opportunities for further military assistance”.  Morrison praised Zelenskiy as a “lion of democracy”.  The Australian Labor opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, slammed Putin for “aggression in the name of a poisonous, nationalistic lie”.  “You are showing us what true courage is,” Albanese said, speaking directly to Zelenskiy.  The Ukrainian president warned that other nations may follow Russia’s lead in attacking their “neighbours” unless the world stood up now – in a clear reference to China, which has so far resisted taking a stronger line in discouraging Putin’s aggression.  “The worst pages of the 20th century have been brought back by Russia already,” Zelenskiy said. “The biggest threats of that century came back, the evil that humanity thought they had forgotten about a long time ago.  “But the most terrible thing, if we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to a similar war against their neighbours will decide that such things are possible for them.”  The president also spoke confidently and optimistically about the future of his country.  “We know that our dream is undefeatable and indestructable, especially if we can count on the support of the free world, on your support, on your assistance,” he said.  “We need it not just in a couple of months, we need it urgently, now.”  Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s citizens were “already thinking about the future, about how we’re going to live after the war, and of restoring our country”.  Australia has provided $156m in support to Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in February, including $91m in “lethal and non-lethal military assistance”, which was confirmed in Tuesday evening’s budget papers.  Australia also plans to offer Ukrainians fleeing the conflict a three-year temporary humanitarian visa. It has also joined a range of countries imposing sanctions on Russia.  On Thursday, Morrison said the Australian government was “taking further action to increase the economic costs to Russia after its illegal invasion of Ukraine, supported by Belarus, by applying an additional tariff of 35% for all imports from Russia and Belarus”.  Australia does not have a big trading relationship with Russia. In 2019-20, Australia imported $250m in goods from Russia, such as fertilisers ($71m) and crude petroleum ($59m).  By contrast, Australia exported $723m in goods to Russia in 2019-20, including live animals, specialised machinery and meat, according to data compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat).  Dfat listed Australia as a lowly 94th on the list of Russia’s main export destinations before the pandemic.  The Australian government has been particularly critical of the growing alignment between Russia and China – concerns shared by a top UK intelligence chief.  The director of GCHQ, Sir Jeremy Fleming, told an audience in Canberra that there were risks to both Russia and China from being “too closely aligned”.  “Russia understands that long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically,” Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University. “Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation.  “And it is equally clear that a China that wants to set the rules of the road – the norms for a new global governance – is not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores them all.”

The investigation, in collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), identified and tracked jets linked to sanctioned businesspeople and officials including Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister.  While some plane movements appeared to comply with airspace bans and sanctions, including asset freezes, others appeared to escape restrictions.  Guardian analysis also showed jets linked to Russians under sanctions flew to the United Arab Emirates in greater numbers during the week after the start of the invasion than any other week of 2022.  The UAE is popular with Russians as a finance and leisure centre.  Jets linked to Shuvalov were tracked flying into and out of EU airports after sanctions were imposed by the bloc on 23 February, the day before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.  His Bombardier Global Express jet, registration LX-ABC, made several flights between Geneva, Munich, Paris, Milan and Helsinki after that date, according to data provided by the flight tracking service Flightradar24. The records do not include details of who was on board the plane, which typically sells for $10m (£7.6m).  EU sanctions rules allow those targeted by the restrictions to make payments to meet “basic needs” such as legal fees but do not mention expenses associated with the movements of private planes, such as buying jet fuel.  The Uzbekistan-born billionaire Usmanov, a major sponsor of Everton football club and a former 30% shareholder in Arsenal, is linked to two other multimillion-pound jets.  Both planes flew out of EU airports after “Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft” were banned from EU airspace by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, according to data from ADS-B Exchange, a website that collects live aircraft transponder data.  Usmanov’s Airbus A340, the commercial version of which can seat 370 passengers, left Munich on the evening of 28 February and was last recorded descending over Tashkent that night.  The jet, which is decorated with distinctive maroon livery, cost between $350m and $500m and is one of the largest private jets in Russia, according to the US Treasury, which said its tail number, M-IABU, stands for “I’m Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov”.  The flight took place the day after the EU flight ban was imposed and the same day Usmanov was added to the bloc’s sanctions list.  An Airbus A340 linked to the Uzbekistan-born billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Photograph: Alamy  The second jet left Florence in Italy the same day and was also heading towards Uzbekistan when the transponder signal was lost over Turkmenistan.  A spokesperson for Usmanov said sanctions against him were based on “incorrect” assumptions about his relationship with the Kremlin, adding that his assets, including private jets, had been transferred to irrevocable trusts long before sanctions were imposed against the billionaire.  “[We] deny there was any wrongdoing or attempt to avoid any assets being sanctioned,” the spokesperson said. “Given the fact that the MI-ABU jet you invoked is not owned or controlled by Mr Usmanov, and could only be used by him on lease terms, there is no legal grounds for any ban on it in relation to the individual sanctions imposed against him.  “Regarding compliance with the rules of aircraft departures, our detailed legal analysis found no violations. To the best of our knowledge, the departure was made in accordance with the permission of the authorised authority of the country from which the aircraft departed.”  The spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about whether Usmanov was onboard either of the flights.  While some of the jets remain out of the reach of authorities despite being linked to oligarchs under sanctions, other aircraft have already been seized or barred from flying.    Jets linked to Abramovich have also been active in the weeks since the Ukraine invasion, which has resulted in the Chelsea FC owner being sanctioned by the UK and the EU.  One, a Bombardier Global 6000, registration LX-LUX, is now grounded in Latvia, denied permission to leave by the authorities pending confirmation of its ownership by authorities in Luxembourg, where the plane is registered.  If it is found to belong to Abramovich, who has been linked to at least three other private jets, it will be considered a frozen asset, Aivis Vincevs, of Latvia’s Civil Aviation Agency, told the news website Re:Baltica.  A close associate of Abramovich, Eugene Shvidler, has also had two jets seized by UK authorities, at London Biggin Hill and Farnborough airports.  One jet had flown from Biggin Hill to Farnborough on 27 February, according to the Flightradar24 data. The jet also made a transatlantic flight to a small airport outside New York later on 27 February, returning to Farnborough on 4 March.  A UK flight ban on Russian aircraft came into effect two days earlier.  A spokesperson for Shvidler said there had “never been any breaches” and that he was not a Russian citizen and did not have any ties to the Kremlin.  Aircraft that visited the UAE include some of those linked in previous reports to Abramovich and the Ukrainian opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, as well as Russian businesspeople Andrey Guryev, Andrey Melnichenko and Oleg Deripaska.  The UAE has been described as the “Switzerland of the Persian Gulf” by organisations including Tax Justice Network, owing to its high degree of banking secrecy, suggesting oligarchs barred from other financial centres may have travelled there to organise their financial affairs.

Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images  A jet reportedly linked to Melnichenko, a billionaire whose superyacht was seized by Italian authorities earlier this month, flew to Dubai on 9 March, according to Flightradar data. The Boeing 737 is currently under investigation in Luxembourg, where it is registered.  A spokesperson for Melnichenko said he was an international self-made entrepreneur who had “no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine”.  “He has no political affiliations. There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on any sanctions lists.”  A spokesperson for Deripaska said sanctions against him were “deeply misguided”.  “The decision to sanction Mr Deripaska has nothing to do with justice or law, neither does the freezing of assets belonging to him or his family. Therefore, as he already stated on his Twitter account, it will be for the courts and the police to discover the true origins and beneficiaries of this decision.”  Spokespeople for Abramovich, Shuvalov, Medvedchuk and Guryev did not return requests for comment.

A host of high-profile international jewellers, including American brand Tiffany & Co, Swiss watch and jewellery-maker Chopard, Signet, the largest retailer of diamond jewellery, and Pandora, the world’s largest jeweller, have released statements saying they will stop buying diamonds of Russian origin.  In mid-march, the Guardian reported on growing concerns that trade with Russia’s partly state-owned diamond miner was lining Russian state coffers, and could be funding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; as well how jewellers could easily – and legally – circumnavigate sanctions by buying Russian stones processed through India. In the days since, multiple major retailers said they would stop sourcing Russian diamonds. This week, Pandora and Chopard were the latest to announce the move, with both saying they had instructed all suppliers to stop sourcing raw materials of Russian origin. They followed moves by Tiffany and Signet earlier in March.  Russia produces about 30% of the world’s diamonds – 98% of which are mined and sold by Alrosa, an enormous mining monopoly with close ties to the Kremlin. A third of Alrosa is owned by the central government, and another third by regional governments – the Russian republic of Yakutia and its administrations. The company brings in significant profits for its government shareholders, reporting sales of $4.16bn in 2021, resulting in a net profit of 91bn rubles ($943m). Putin has said in the past that it “gives serious revenues to the federal budget and regional budget”.  Both the US and UK have introduced sanctions forbidding companies from doing direct business with Alrosa. The sanctions alone, however, are unlikely to stop the flow of Russian diamonds to the west, because the vast majority are exported rough to India, where they are cut and polished. Under US customs rulings, this is considered a “significant transformation” – so polished diamonds can be legally imported as an Indian product, not a Russian one.  Decisions over whether to truly pause trade of Alrosa’s diamonds will therefore fall to the industry, and to key certification bodies. Within the sector, however, a storm has been brewing over “responsible sourcing” groups that have remained quiet on sourcing of Russian diamonds, with multiple high-profile members resigning in protest.  The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) – one of the crucial jewellery watchdogs – was set up to help regulate the sector, improve its reputation, promote responsible sourcing, and eliminate “conflict diamonds” from supply chains. The Guardian reported earlier in March that the council had been accused of silence over Russian diamonds although it has issued guidance that members should comply with sanctions. While Alrosa has stepped down from the organisation’s board, it remains a member and has kept its “responsible” certification. The council has a number of past or present long-term Alrosa customers on its board.  Now, the council is facing a wave of exits. Brands that have announced they are leaving over the Russian diamonds issue include Pandora, Richemont, the owner of Cartier, and Kering, the owner of high-fashion brands including Gucci and Saint Laurent. On Wednesday, the organisation’s executive director Iris Van der Veken resigned over its handling of the issue. Van der Veken declined to comment.  In a statement, Richemont, the owner of Cartier, said it was leaving the organisation in protest. “Richemont and its maisons do not wish to be members of an industry organisation that includes companies that contribute to financing conflicts and wars.”  Pandora representatives said the company was leaving the council after 12 years as a member, over its “failure to suspend Russian companies’ memberships and responsible business certifications and urge its members to suspend business with Russia. Pandora had previously requested that RJC take such actions.”  “The war requires all businesses to act with the utmost responsibility regarding any interactions or business dealings with Russia and Belarus. Pandora cannot in good faith be a member of an association that does not share our values,” chief executive Alexander Lacik said.  Gucci and Balenciaga owner Kering said the brand “does not want to be associated in any way with business practices that contribute to an endorsement of war.”  “The RJC is at a crucial crossroads,” said Cristina Villegas, director of the Mines to Markets program at development organisation Pact. “The current definitions of responsibility are silent on what happens when a company’s assets are being used to directly and indirectly fund an unprovoked conflict that’s displaced millions of people.”  RJC chair David A. Bouffard said in a statement that the council had “commenced an arm’s length, independent, third-party legal assessment … to consider the status of Alrosa as an RJC member”.  “The pace of this process may be frustrating, but this is an unprecedented situation, which is constantly changing and requires that the time be taken, to ensure that due process is followed as exhaustively as possible.” Bouffard said the process would conclude “imminently”.  Brad Brooks-Rubin, strategic adviser to the council, said the exodus of members was significant for the industry. “If the current trajectory continues and more members [leave]… there’s not another competing organisation in the industry,” he said. “That leaves the jewellery industry exposed to real concerns about: what standards are you implementing? What does it mean to be responsible, sustainable, ethical? The RJC has provided that – and if it’s not the RJC, what takes its place?”  Brooks-Rubin had spoken out earlier in March to criticise the lack of action or transparency on Russian diamonds, saying the council’s action against Alrosa had been “insufficient”. He said decisions about boycotting diamond-producing countries were complex, with millions of international jobs and livelihoods depending on the flow of diamonds.  “If 30-40% of the supply chain is off the market, then that affects everybody. That affects prices, that affects the supply chain, that affects every entity in the entire industry.” He said the council needed to be clear and transparent about the challenges it faced.

In an early morning video address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said that Russia’s announcement that it was pulling troops away from cities such as Kyiv and Chernihiv had been forced upon the Kremlin by the fierce resistance of Ukraine’s armed forces.  The Ukrainian leader added that his government was instead seeing “a build-up of Russian forces for new strikes on the Donbas and we are preparing for that”. The leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said on Wednesday that offensive operations were intensifying.  00:58 Zelenskiy says peace talks will continue with Russia but nothing is concrete – video  Such a move would be consistent with Moscow’s claim this week about a withdrawal from some areas to focus on “liberating” the breakaway eastern Donbas region, although Zelenskiy said it was “the consequence of our defenders’ work”.  The Donbas includes the besieged city of Mariupol where the Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated, according to Agence France-Presse.  Despite the withdrawal claims, Russian forces have continued to bombard the northern city of Chernihiv and parts of the capital Kyiv. Ukrainian military officials said they had seen some Russian units pull out but only because they had suffered heavy losses.  The fate of the south-eastern Donbas region, which Russia demands Ukraine cede to the separatists, was a topic of discussion at peace talks held on Tuesday in Istanbul palace. A senior Ukrainian negotiator said on Wednesday night that the talks will resume online on Friday.  Zelenskiy said the talks had produced nothing “concrete” while one of his senior aides said the Ukrainian leader could meet Putin “soon”.  The head of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that Moscow was scrutinising proposals submitted by Kyiv in Istanbul which he believed could lead to a presidential peace summit between the pair. However, a Kremlin spokesman downplayed the hopes of an early breakthrough in the peace talks.  Ukraine has sought a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty, though it has proposed adopting a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees. Russia opposes Ukraine joining Nato, the western military alliance, and has cited its potential membership as a reason for the invasion.  Zelenskiy also said in his TV address that he talked to Joe Biden for an hour on Wednesday during another “very active diplomatic day”. He said he thanked the US president for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. Zelenskiy said: “The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world.”  A possible shift in the military situation in Ukraine came as the head of Britain’s spy services agency claimed that Putin has been misinformed about the extent of Russian military failure in Ukraine because his advisers are too frightened to tell him the damning truth.  Sir Jeremy Fleming, in a speech given in Australia on Thursday, said the Russian leader had misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance, the western response and the ability of his forces to deliver a rapid victory.  Fleming, whose comments were backed up by US and EU officials, said that the failure to achieve a quick victory must be causing discord in the Kremlin. “And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.”  Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby agreed and said: “It’s [Putin’s] military. It’s his war. He chose it ... the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting.”  Other key developments include:  The Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated from Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Agence France-Presse. A humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via the Russian-controlled port of Berdiansk, would be opened from 10am (7am GMT), it said.  The Biden administration is considering a plan to release roughly one million barrels of oil a day from US reserves for several months, in order to combat  rising fuel prices exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, according Bloomberg.  Germany has triggered the first stage of plans to ration power if the standoff with Russia over gas supplies and sanctions is not resolved. Moscow is demanding that payment for energy be made in roubles, but this could undercut western sanctions on Russia and countries are under pressure not to go along with the Kremlin’s plan.  The Russian rouble has recovered to its pre-war value despite western sanctions on the country’s exports and financial systems. The currency was trading at 75.5 to one US dollar on Thursday morning, compared with almost 140 at the beginning of March when it crashed with the onest of sanctions.  Zelenskiy was due to address Australian parliament on Thursday.  Global restrictions on exports of industrial components to Russia have hit car and tank production. A carmaker has shut down and tank production has halted, according to the US. Baikal Electronics, a Russian semiconductor company and computer manufacturer, has been cut off from integrated circuits to support its surveillance, servers, and other domestic communications equipment.  Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India on Thursday to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia. Her arrival in New Delhi coincides with that of her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who will be making his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Major jewellers including American brand Tiffany & Co, Swiss watch and jewellery-maker Chopard, Signet, the largest retailer of diamond jewellery, and Pandora, the world’s largest jeweller, have released statements saying they will stop buying diamonds of Russian origin.  The UK has announced new laws targeting the access of Russian oligarchs to “UK aviation and maritime technical services”, according to the Foreign Office.

As the train comes to a halt, carriage attendants toss boxes of humanitarian aid to station workers waiting on the platform.  Huddles of passengers, who arrived at the station hours earlier so as not to be on the streets during curfew hours, search in the inky blackness for the right carriage, before the train is on its way again with a gnashing of wheels and a long hiss of steam.  Refugees arriving in Lviv on evacuation trains from Kharkiv and Kryvy Rih make their way through the train station  Refugees struggle to get on to the evacuation train from Lviv to Przemyśl, Poland, as authorities inspect their papers. The women and children in the family make it on to the train, while the men do not.  This scene has played out at stations across Ukraine repeatedly over the last month, as Ukrainian Railways has been engaged in one of the most impressive elements of Ukraine’s war effort. Several million people have travelled west to safety on evacuation trains, while the carriages have returned east packed with tonnes of humanitarian aid.  Refugees wait at the border crossing of Medyka after crossing into Poland. Most travel to Lviv by evacuation train; from there they either take another evacuation train to Poland, or they go by bus or car to the Polish border. Once they have crossed the border on foot, buses are available to bring them to the nearest town Przemyśl.  Ukrainian Railways employs more than 230,000 people, and almost all its employees have stayed in the country to work, according to Oleksandr Kamyshin, the company’s CEO. While stations in the areas under Russian occupation are now closed, the trains have continued running even to cities like Kharkiv, which has been under constant Russian fire.  Since the war started 64 employees have died and 71 have been injured, he said, counting incidents at work and those at the homes of employees.  “If the track is blown up, we repair it. If we can get somewhere, we go. It may be dangerous for our staff, but then that train can save thousands of other people from danger,” said Kamyshin, in an interview at Kyiv’s central station. He and a small “mobile command centre” of seven people has spent the last month crisscrossing the country on trains, to show support for staff working in all parts of the country.  “We have several special carriages for our use, but we don’t use them outside the west of the country because the Russians may be able to identify them,” he said.  Viacheslav Chumak, 43, who runs the evacuation train from Kyiv to Lviv.  “I work for the Ukrzaliznytsia from 1996 and I have travelled all over Ukraine: Kyiv-Lviv, Kyiv-Kostiantynivka, Kyiv-Dnipro, Kyiv-Kharkiv. I am feeling a sense of anxiety from doing my job. How can you look at the children’s eyes, who are scared, and at their mothers, who are going nowhere. Their soul is torn and their heart aches. As a train driver I see what is going on.”  At the peak of the evacuation programme, 200,000 people a day were travelling west, on trains that were made free of charge for everyone, with women and children having priority.  There were heartbreaking scenes at Kyiv’s central station during the early part of the war, as residents feared the capital could face the same fate as Mariupol, Kharkiv and other cities and scrambled to get out as quickly as possible. The trains were often crowded, uncomfortable and sweaty inside, but they did the job. In the first two weeks of the war alone, 2 million passengers were taken to safety.  Dmytro Yaroshenko, 36, has been working on the railway since he was 20. He is now the train manager on the 82 train, running between Uzhhorod in the far west, on the Slovakian border, and Kyiv.  Ukrainian train manager Dmytro Yaroshenko on board his Uzhhorod-Kyiv train.  “We turn the lights off for the section of the journey around Kyiv, and anywhere that might be dangerous, as well as if the train stops. Who knows who might be hiding in the bushes,” he said, on a recent journey towards the Ukrainian capital.  He said he had no qualms about continuing to work during wartime, and saw his own role as part of the overall Ukrainian war effort.  Tetjana, 36, and her daughter Sofia, 5 from Sumy, a city that has been under attack by Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion. Tetjana was working as a train conductor on evacuation trains but for the sake of her daughter’s safety she says she now decided to flee the country herself. She was the last person to leave the apartment building in which they were living. They are on their way to Przemyśl in an evacuation train themselves, which is at a stop in Lviv.  A carriage reserved for children with special needs in the evacuation train from Kryvyi Rih to Chop. The train ride took two full days. During the night, the lights were switched off so the train would not be visible to Russian forces.  “It’s painful that our soldiers, our women and children are dying. But nerves and hysterics don’t help. At these times it’s better to get a grip of yourself and stay calm,” he said.  Working the trains is a way of life in Ukraine, and Yaroshenko talks about his team with genuine pride. The number 82 is “one of the best” in the country, he said. He wore a smart navy uniform with gold buttons embossed with the Ukrainian trident.  “I have 25 carriage attendants, and we’re like a family. We have New Year’s parties together, we have our own group on Viber. They need to look at their boss and take an example from me that I’m not panicking,” he said. On his days off, he helps guard a checkpoint near his home village.  Eugen Zagoruk, train driver on the route Lviv – Przemyśl. “I run the evacuation train in the western direction. To the stations Mostyska, Sambir, Syanky, Lavochne, Mukachevo and Uzhhorod. The journey from here to Poland takes 21 hours, and they already traveled from the east for who knows how many hours. When we arrive in Poland, they still have to go somewhere else and it is impossible to know how many hours that will all take.”  Evacuation train driver Eugen Zagoruk gets the final call with permission to leave the station for Poland with a full evacuation train.  The train manager is responsible for ensuring the safety of the journey and the passengers, a role which has taken on added meaning in wartime. Before each departure, Yaroshenko checks various WhatsApp and Telegram groups where train operators share the latest intelligence. Last Thursday, he was alarmed by reports that a train had come under fire near the town of Vasylkiv outside Kyiv, and several windows had been blown out.  Roman Gasyuk, an evacuation train diver, in his cabin at a stop in Lviv doing final checks before departure to Przemyśl, Poland. “I’m doing evacuation routes from Lviv to Przemyśl. Lviv can not provide enough beds for refugees and while Europe is accepting them we need to give them the opportunity to reach safe place during the war. Yes, our profession is kind of dangerous because we might have attacks on the way, but still I think that risk is low because our territorial defence units are looking after our safety, controlling all bridges and all securing the vulnerable places.”  Train driver Gasyuk’s assistant is filling in the log on their stop in Lviv central station.  It transpired that, in fact, a Russian missile had hit a nearby fuel storage depot, and the shock waves had smashed the windows. The track was undamaged, and Yaroshenko’s train could run as scheduled.  As the war has ground on, small things have changed: there is no longer fresh bedding in the sleeping carriages, because some of the places they were laundered are now under Russian occupation.  Almost every train is late arriving, because they stop to load and unload humanitarian aid, and have to wait outside large cities if air raid alerts are sounding when they are due to pull in. Their top speeds have been reduced, so that in the case of sabotage, accidents would be less likely to be fatal.  But, remarkably, most trains continue to run.  In recent years, Ukrainian Railways has undergone a programme of significant reforms, and installed a young, western-educated management team. Kamyshin is just 37. However, he said the necessities of war period had forced him to return to some of the old ways.  Olexiy Stasenko, 31, runs the evacuation train from Zhmerynka, Ukraine. His family remains in Zhmerynka. When asked if he is planning to evacuate them he says: “Why? Why would I evacuate them? If we leave, who will be here to protect our country?” His longest route was 17 hours. Then they rest for 6 hours and go again. “Today we are doing the evacuation route from Zhmerynka, we departed at 06:24 am. We will have a rest now and then we will be driving back. We have huge amounts of passengers, everyone is leaving. For sure it’s dangerous, but we were are well prepared for it.”  “We had implemented European stuff and became a place of discussions rather than decisions, we lost this vertical command culture. In wartime, we brought it back,” he said, adding that some of this speedy decision making would be retained after the war was over.  Kamyshin said the evacuation programme is now “basically done”, and the focus of the railway leadership is now on helping to build export and customs capacity on the country’s western borders to increase rail exports, after the Russian advance has put Ukraine’s southern ports, which handle much of its export trade, out of action.  “Once the ports are unblocked the cargo will flow through them again, but we will still have this crazy neighbour. And this crazy neighbour could make problems for years. So we need to develop these western corridors, and have them as Plan B, with the option to extend them significantly at any moment.”

Sir Jeremy Fleming, in a speech given in Australia, said the Russian leader had misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance, the western response and the ability of his forces to deliver a rapid victory.  01:55 Putin's advisers ‘afraid to tell him truth’ about Ukraine, says UK spy chief – video  “It all adds up to the strategic miscalculation that western leaders warned Putin it would be. It’s become his personal war, with the cost being paid by innocent people in Ukraine and, increasingly, by ordinary Russians too,” Fleming said.  Western security officials want to lay the responsibility for February’s unprovoked invasion on Putin, who they characterise as a dominant, isolated leader who is making poor decisions partly because he no longer gets accurate information or honest opinions from his subordinates.  As a result, Fleming said he believed that the failure to achieve a quick victory must be causing discord in the Kremlin. “Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.”  Earlier, US officials made a similar point, arguing that Putin was being misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging western sanctions have been.  “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,” said Kate Bedingfield, director of communications at the White House.    “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.”  She added: “So, it is increasingly clear that Putin’s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage.”  Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby later agreed with the White House assessment: “It’s [Putin’s] military. It’s his war. He chose it ... the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting.”  Ahead of the invasion, Putin held a bizarre meeting with his key advisers over whether to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Some senior figures were clearly in fear of the president, who has led the country for 22 years, as he demanded each endorse the breakaway territories.  There were also growing signs, Fleming said, that Russian soldiers “short of weapons and morale” were “refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft”.  No evidence was given to back up the air accident claim, although Whitehall sources said they were confident enough to allow Fleming to refer to it in the speech, partly to demonstrate to Russian insiders their knowledge of the military situation.  The spy chief also warned China not to become “too closely aligned” with Russia as the war continues, the latest in a string of remarks by western leaders and officials aimed at trying to persuade Beijing not to supply Moscow with money and arms.  Fleming said that Putin has made a clear “strategic choice” to align with China before the fighting broke out, but that there remained underlying tensions between the two countries – and risks for both in trying to work together.  “Russia understands that, long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation,” Fleming is expected to say.  “And it is equally clear that a China that wants to set the rules of the road – the norms for a new global governance – is not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores them all.”

A humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via the Russian-controlled port of Berdiansk, would be opened from 10am (7am GMT), the ministry said on Wednesday.  Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that Russia is massing its forces for a big offensive in the eastern region of Donbas. He said Ukraine was “prepared” for it and added that any Russian withdrawal of troops from around Kyiv had been forced by the fierce resistance of Ukrainian troops.  Russia and Ukraine will resume online peace talks on Friday 1 April. A senior Ukraine official said leaders of the two countries, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, could meet “soon”, but the Kremlin downplayed hopes of an early breakthrough. Ukraine’s president said in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday that “for the moment there are just words, nothing concrete”.  Zelenskiy said he talked to Joe Biden for an hour on another “very active diplomatic day”, thanking the US president for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. Zelenskiy said: “The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world.”  Russian shelling continued on Wednesday despite Moscow saying on Tuesday that it would scale back its attacks around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. However, reports citing the Pentagon said that Russian forces were “walking away” from the Chernobyl nuclear plant.  UK, US and EU officials say Putin has been misled over Russian military performance. Putin has received misinformation about how well Russia is doing and how much the sanctions have affected the country because some of those closest to him are afraid to tell him the truth, according to a speech planned by the head of Britain’s GCHQ spy service on Thursday.  Sir Jeremy Fleming is also expected to say that some Russian soldiers are refusing to carry out orders, and that they are poorly equipped and have low morale.  Global restrictions on exports of industrial components to Russia have hit car and tank production. A carmaker has shut down and tank production has halted, according to the US.  Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India on Thursday to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia. Her arrival in New Delhi coincides with that of her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who will be making his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The UK has announced new laws targeting the access of Russian oligarchs to “UK aviation and maritime technical services”, according to the Foreign Office.  Eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted “golden visas” to live in Britain. The individuals were granted the right to live in the UK after promising to invest at least £2m under the controversial tier 1 investor visa scheme, the UK government has admitted.  Russian hackers have recently attempted to penetrate the networks of Nato and the militaries of some eastern European countries, according to a report by Google’s threat analysis group. The report did not say which militaries had been targeted in what Google described as “credential phishing campaigns” launched by a Russian-based group called Coldriver, or Callisto.

But it’s also the place where my grandfather was born. He fled as a 10-year-old. The train station in Lviv is the same train station from which my grandfather fled from the Russians. History just goes round and round.”  A leading international lawyer who has acted as counsel for Solomon Islands, Georgia, and Gambia in the international court of justice, Sands is also a celebrated author. In East West Street he chronicles the invention of two legal concepts – “crimes against humanity” and “genocide” – and their intersection with the life of his grandfather. Sands reveals how two men, Hersch Lauterpacht and Raphael Lemkin, originated the competing concepts while they were law professors in the city that was first Lemberg, then Lwow and is now Lviv. It is a complex legal dispute that changed the course of the Nuremberg trials and the future of international law.  Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Sands argued in the Financial Times that, while he supported the newly announced international criminal court investigations into war crimes and crimes against humanity, there should also be an immediate investigation for the crime of aggression.  Sands’ proposal quickly gained steam, with the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown joining forces with Sands to set up a special tribunal that could investigate the crime of aggression. Signatories to the plan include scores of leading figures in international politics and law as well as writers and public intellectuals.  I spoke with Sands to understand the origins of the crime of aggression and its significance to the war in Ukraine.  Can you explain why it’s important to begin investigations and even bring prosecutions now, while bombs are still dropping, people are still dying and the war has no obvious end in sight? What is the urgency of a legal response? Nuremberg happened after the second world war was over.  Different communities do what they can. In such moments, the medical community is providing medical assistance, the artistic community is providing moral support, writers are writing petitions. So what can lawyers do? We’re pretty useless but we have the law. That’s what we know.  What is different from say, 1939, is there’s a body of rules, there are courts: the European court of human rights, the international court of justice and the international criminal court. So the litigation of conflict is something that’s been going up the agenda. But what does it achieve is the bigger question.  I think it provides hope to people who are on the receiving end of horror. People feel they’re not alone  First, I think it provides hope to people who are on the receiving end of horror. I know from the messages that I’m receiving, from Kyiv, from Lviv, that it provides hope because people feel they’re not alone.  Secondly, it provides a means for delegitimizing behaviour.  Thirdly, in very practical, political terms: if the whole of Ukraine falls, there are proceedings under way, which the current, existing, lawful government of Ukraine will be able to take forward.  Fourth, at some point, there will be a deal to be done and it gives Ukraine a lot more leverage. You can’t just make the ICC prosecutor stop investigating or prosecuting. You can’t just tell the ICJ to put down tools and stop its case. So it becomes another factor in the process, and that delegitimises Putin.  The ICC is investigating crimes against humanity and war crimes, but you’ve argued that there needs to be a special tribunal set up to investigate for a third crime, the crime of aggression. Why is that so important and is there that much difference between the three crimes?  As of 1939, there was basically one relevant international crime, and that was war crimes.  Then in 1945, in London, the drafters of what became the Nuremberg statute, sat down and looked at what they were going to prosecute and indict the Nazis for. There weren’t any crimes so they basically had to invent them. They called them crimes against humanity, genocide, and what they then called crimes against peace which today is the crime of aggression: waging a manifestly illegal war.  Mariya, a local resident, looks for personal items in the rubble of her house on Wednesday. The house was destroyed during fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the village of Yasnohorodka, on the outskirts of Kyiv. Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP  Since 1945, those have been the four crimes that we’ve had. (I’ve spent much of the last year working on a fifth crime, which is ecocide, but we can put that on one side for now.)  In theory, the ICC has jurisdiction over all four of them. However, when the ICC statute was adopted in 1998 a decision was taken not to give the ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression because certain large powers were worried: is it going to turn on us?  Five years later, we had the Iraq war. And so they decided not to give the ICC jurisdiction of the crime of aggression until they’d defined the crime of aggression and that took almost 20 years. They finally agree a definition in 2017 in Kampala and 43 countries have ratified it. But the definition says: you cannot exercise jurisdiction of the ICC in relation to the crime of aggression against a person who is a national of a country that’s not a party to the ICC standard.  So for lay people’s understanding: Karim Khan QC, the prosecutor for the ICC, can investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide on the territory of Ukraine. But he cannot investigate the crime of aggression because Russia did not ratify the statute.  The difficulty with crimes against humanity and war crimes is that you have to show a direct connection between the act that amounts to the crime, and the perpetrator. For example, we’ve seen some horrific video footage apparently of individuals being shot. So the Russian soldier who shot the man who got out of his car with his hands up. That would appear to be a war crime, on its face. So who’s in the frame? The Russian soldier, yes. His commanding officer probably, for authorising rules of engagement, which allowed that to happen.  But does it go all the way up to the generals? Does it go up to the civilian command? Does it go up to Putin? These are really complex questions.  By focusing on crimes against humanity and war crimes, you’re going to end up in seven years’ time with trials of mid-level folk. And the big issue, the waging of an illegal war, is never going to go to justice. That’s why I wrote that war crimes and crimes against humanity investigations alone could end up as a means of letting the main man off the hook.  Every act, every attack, every bomb on a theatre with 1,000 people in it is a crime of aggression  Were you expecting the article to lead to something more concrete?  I did not expect the consequences that followed from the article. But I’m pleased that the consequences have followed because, frankly, the crime of aggression is a slam dunk. We have made great progress. We’re talking informally with a small group of countries about the possibility of establishing an interim office to investigate. We’re talking with potential prosecutors with extensive experience.  The indictment writes itself. There’s no difficulty of proof. There’s no great difficulty in evidence. It’s not only the decision to wage war, it’s the decision to continue waging it now even after the international court of justice has said in a binding legal decision: stop, withdraw your troops. Every act, every attack, every bomb on a theatre with 1,000 people in it is a crime of aggression. I don’t want to let these people off the hook.  Are there any barriers to getting such a tribunal set up?  The two governments I think will cause the most problem on this will be the British and the French. It’s got nothing to do with principle. It’s got everything to do with fear of precedent, and what might happen to them. We need to spend quite a lot of time encouraging the British and the French governments to reflect on whether they want to be the ones to effectively let Mr Putin off the hook because of their own fear of being hauled up before some tribunal in the future.  President Biden has called Putin a war criminal and Zelenskiy has invoked the word genocide to describe what’s happening in Ukraine. Why are you uncomfortable with their language?    I wondered how wise it was, for senior politicians to be characterising particular individuals as war criminals. I think one can say that Mr Putin has waged a war that is manifestly illegal. There’s no conceivable defence or justification for it in law. But would I say that Mr Putin is a war criminal? No. I’m not sure that President Biden chose his words with particular care. Was he saying that he had violated the Geneva conventions? I’m not fully comfortable with those kinds of labels being pasted on particular individuals.  Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses the participants of the Doha Forum via videolink last week. Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters  What about Zelenskiy, who said a ‘genocide of Ukrainians is taking place’?  I think he’s used it in a political sense. On the basis of what I’ve seen, there is no genocide of the Ukrainian population in its legal parlance, going on. I do not see an intention to destroy a group in whole or in part, within the meaning of the 1948 convention.  Are Ukrainians aware that these concepts originated in their country?  When I arrived for the first time in Lviv in October 2010, the people at the law faculty with only one exception, a very elderly professor, were not aware that the originators of the concepts of crimes against humanity and genocide had studied at their law faculty, and that you could trace the origins of those two crimes to that city, to that law faculty, to a single room. When I went back a year later, they had photographs of Lauterpacht and Lemkin and they’ve now got signs on their houses, busts in their villages and in the law faculty.  That must make you feel good.  It does make me feel warm. What’s interesting about this is it’s very complex, because [Lauterpacht and Lemkin] were Polish Jews, and the reality is that in the period 1941 to 1944, some Ukrainians were very active in supporting Germans. I’ve often talked about that complex history when I’m in Ukraine, and they want to engage with it. I am very troubled by Putin seizing on that to make the claim that Ukraine is a Nazi country. It’s not.  But gradually, as the years pass, that information about Lauterpacht and Lemkin has been embraced.  Are there any reasons to be optimistic?  It’s a wake up call. I think we’ve become incredibly complacent in the West, imagining that war in Europe had ended forever.  The world changed in 1945. It was a revolutionary moment. For the first time, states agreed that they were not absolutely sovereign, that they could not kill individuals or destroy groups.  The 1945 legacy was under real attack from Britain and the United States. Now “make America great again” and Brexit have reminded us of the singular importance of that 1945 moment.  Who could have imagined one month ago that the US Senate would be presented with a resolution by Senator Lindsey Graham calling for total support for the investigation by the international criminal court? And that it would be passing unanimously. That is a sea change, and it’s a really significant sea change.  You can’t adopt a resolution saying the ICC has jurisdiction over Russian nationals, while saying it has no jurisdiction over Americans. So it’s not another 1945 moment but with a bit of luck, it will reinforce the 1945 amendment and give it renewed life. And that is a good thing.

Emmanuel Macron continues his dogged round of phone calls with Vladimir Putin, but it is the Turkish foreign ministry that seems able to bring the Ukrainians and Russians together.  It is a curious position. Turkey, a Nato member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, and yet is apparently respected enough by both sides to host Tuesday’s talks.  The Turks also have a profound sense of what may be at stake. Speaking at the weekend in Doha, Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser and spokesperson to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spelled it out: “Once this is all over, there will have to be a new security architecture to emerge globally. How that global security architecture will be structured will shape the course of events for decades to come. Every step we take, every move we make to bring an end to this war will have an impact on that new security architecture.”  In short, this is a set of peace talks that could have reverberations not just for the combatants, but the world.  It would also be wrong to think Turkey does not have its own point of view. Kalin says: “What led to this war needs to be studied carefully. The power disequilibrium that has shaped the international order ever since the end of the cold war over the last three decades has everything to do with the rise of this crisis and eventually the war we are trying to stop now.”  Although he said the war was unjustified and unprovoked, he added: “Whatever causes and grievances or security concerns Russia had going to this war have to be heard, not justified. We need to talk to Russia. If everybody burns bridges with Russia who is going to talk to them at the end of the day?”  By inference, he was saying the era of American hegemony had to end.  The foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on Saturday said he believed Ukraine’s best interests lay in pursuing a balanced foreign policy.  Turkey may even provide a role model of sorts, he suggested, refusing to choose between east and west – something he said Turkey had been forced to do due to its geography. The reality is more complex, and probably more self-serving. After a long period offending many in the region, Turkey – perhaps driven by economic weakness – has been mending fences.  The Ukrainian delegation leaves after the peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Tuesday. Photograph: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu/Getty  Either way, Çavuşoğlu said, “We have to find a face-saving way out or an honourable exit for both sides that they can sell publicly and globally.”  The initial Turkey-hosted meeting, between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, took place earlier this month, on the fringes of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. It made little progress, even if Kuleba fleshed out the offer for Ukraine to drop its request to join Nato and instead adopt a neutral status in return for security guarantees provided by an unidentified group of countries. Lavrov was clearly not briefed to make serious response.  But at the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul, initially slated to last two days, the Ukrainian offer became more explicit, and was delivered in writing. The Ukrainian delegation this time was headed up by the adviser to the president of Ukraine, Mihaylo Podolyak, and the Russian delegation was led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Kalin had been instrumental in assembling the cast list. The presence of Roman Abramovich at the talks shows how central the former Chelsea football club owner has become.  Podolyak said Ukraine wanted to see China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Israel as the guarantor states. Their role, akin to the Nato article 5 commitment, would be to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty if threatened. It is a reworking of the Budapest memorandum of 1994.  Podolyak claimed “preliminary acceptance came from some countries that we wanted to be guarantor countries”, adding he thought ground existed for a meeting hosted by Turkey, a goal alongside a humanitarian ceasefire the Turkish foreign minister said was achievable.  “Nothing very promising so far” was the downbeat account from Moscow on Wednesday. But Turkey is more optimistic and thinks there is a plan capable of gaining traction.  Turkey’s next aim is to get Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Putin in the same room in the next fortnight. At the moment it seems unlikely Putin thinks he is losing, or has much to gain from such an encounter.  But if Turkey pulls it off, it would be an extraordinary turnaround for Erdoğan, whose autocratic tendencies had threatened to make him an international pariah.

It is not clear whether he plans to tear up existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but Germany, which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas supplies, is not taking any chances, warning large industrial gas users that a standoff is possible and rationing is one possible outcome.  Here we ask why payment for Russian exports in roubles has become a major issue for the Kremlin, and whether Putin could extend the plan to include exports of oil, grain, fertilisers, coal, metals and other key commodities.  Why does Putin want payment in roubles?  In the aftermath of the Russian invasion the value of the rouble fell off a cliff. It fell from about 85 to the euro last year to 110 as the tanks rolled across Ukraine’s borders. Only an intervention by the Russian central bank it stood at 94.1 to the euro.  With the rouble trading at such low levels, Russian exports were going to bring in less money to subsidise state services and fund the war than previously expected.  A higher valued rouble will not only bring in more cash, it is also a matter of pride that trading nations are prepared to pay for Russian exports in the Russian currency. A larger pool of roubles, generated by the demand from foreign countries and companies for Russian goods, would allow Moscow to challenge the US dominance, via the dollar, of global money markets, although it is not clear why China would support such a plan.  Some analysts have also speculated that dollars and euros are less useful to Moscow while sanctions are tightening. For instance, without access to dollars and euros via international exchanges, Russia is also proposing to pay the interest on its euro-denominated debts with roubles.  Which countries does Putin expect to pay for gas in roubles?  Russia’s list of “unfriendly” countries corresponds to those that have imposed sanctions. Deals with companies and individuals from those countries must be approved by a government commission.  The countries include the US, EU member states, the UK, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Ukraine. Some, including the US and Norway, do not buy Russian gas.  How big are Russian exports to the EU?  In 2020, the EU was Russia’s primary trade partner, accounting for 37.3% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world. Meanwhile, Russia was the EU’s fifth largest trade partner, representing 5.8% of the bloc’s total trade. However, this disguises the important fact that Russian gas is a major feature of those imports, most of which is paid for in dollars, euros or sterling.  According to Gazprom, 58% of its sales of natural gas to Europe and other countries as of 27 January were settled in euros. US dollars accounted for about 39% of gross sales and sterling about 3%. Commodities traded worldwide are largely transacted in dollars or euros, which together make up roughly 80% of worldwide currency reserves.  In practical terms, while gas imports to the EU from Russia are volatile, they account for up to €800m (£680m) of spending every day.  How has Putin exercised his influence?  It wasn’t enough for Russia’s central bank to buy roubles to prop up the currency in its darkest hours after the invasion. An effective ban on the central bank using the Swift payments system to access its assets held overseas meant this intervention could not last.  The central bank wanted to sell dollar and euro investments to buy roubles, increasing demand and consequently the price, but without access to Swift was unable to continue on a sufficient scale.  Another route was found. A directive was slapped on exporters, including commodity producers, forcing them to convert into roubles 80% of the foreign currency they receive on export sales.  Now the Kremlin is considering plans for all export sales to be in roubles, exploiting its near monopoly in the essential raw materials in manufacturing processes, from fertilisers to cars.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  One example is nickel, which car companies use to make catalytic converters. About 40% of the world’s supply of the metal comes from Russia and 90% of Russia’s output goes to the car industry, says Paul Watters, the head of corporate research at S&P Global Ratings.  If carmakers are forced to chose between buying nickel in roubles or looking elsewhere for supplies, it is likely politicians, keen to isolate Russia, will tell them to look elsewhere. Watters fears rationing and car factory closures could be the result.  Could the plan backfire?  If the Kremlin insists current contracts in euros and dollars are changed to roubles, they will be in breach of international protocols. This is not something Gazprom has invoked, even during the cold war when tensions were heightened between the Soviet Union and the west.  Germany has said it is prepared to ration energy supplies rather than pay for gas in roubles, which is likely to plunge the EU’s largest economy into recession but deny Russia the extra cash. The Kremlin move is also likely to hasten a switch away from Russian commodities, adding to the country’s already-dramatic economic decline.

In a separate incident, a Palestinian stabbed a 28-year-old Israeli man on a bus in the West Bank before being killed by a bystander, the Israeli military said. The Magen David Adom emergency service said the stabbing victim was treated and taken to a hospital.  Videos circulated online showing smoke rising from the centre of the Jenin refugee camp as gunfire echoed in the background. Others appeared to show Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen moving through the narrow streets.  The raid came two days after a Palestinian from a village near Jenin shot and killed five people in central Israel, part of a wave of attacks in recent days that have left a total of 11 people dead.  The Palestinian Health Ministry said a 17-year-old and a 23-year-old were killed and another 15 were wounded.  The Israeli military said troops came under fire after entering Jenin to arrest suspects. It said one soldier was wounded and evacuated to a hospital for treatment.  The Jenin refugee camp was the scene of one of the deadliest battles of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising. In April 2002, Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants in the camp, leading to the deaths of 23 Israeli soldiers and more than 50 Palestinians.  In recent years the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, has appeared to have little control over Jenin. Israeli forces operating in and around the city and refugee camp often come under fire.  In Tuesday’s attack, a 27-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Yabad, near Jenin, methodically gunned down victims, killing five. On Sunday night, a shooting attack by two Islamic State sympathisers in the central city of Hadera killed two police officers. Last week, a combined car-ramming and stabbing attack in the southern city of Beersheba – also by an attacker inspired by IS – killed four. The two attacks claimed by IS were carried out by Arab citizens of Israel.  The US president, Joe Biden, spoke with the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, on Wednesday. Biden expressed his condolences after the recent attacks and said the US “stands firmly and resolutely with Israel in the face of this terrorist threat and all threats to the state of Israel”.  The recent wave of violence has brought the Palestinian issue back to the fore at a time when Israel is focussing on building alliances with Arab states against Iran. There have been no serious Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in more than a decade, and Bennett is opposed to Palestinian statehood.  Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian leaders have held a flurry of meetings in recent weeks, and Israel has announced a series of goodwill gestures, in an effort to maintain calm ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this weekend.  They hope to avoid a repeat of last year, when clashes in Jerusalem set off an 11-day Gaza war, but the recent attacks have sent tensions soaring. After a security cabinet meeting late Wednesday, Israel nevertheless decided to carry on with plans to ease restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  Israel captured East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 war, territories the Palestinians want for a future state. Israel annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally. In the West Bank, it is steadily building and expanding Jewish settlements, which most of the international community views as illegal.  Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, and the Palestinian militant group Hamas seized power there two years later. Since then, Israel and Hamas have fought four wars and Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade on the territory, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.

Democrats need only their own 50 votes in the evenly divided Senate to put Jackson on the court, given the casting vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, had already confirmed his support.  But the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote has never been required to confirm a supreme court justice, making Collins’ vote at least symbolically important.  Collins’ support also comes at a time of bitter partisan divide that was underscored by hostile and politically loaded questioning of Jackson led by white, hard-line Republican men, prominently including Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley.  Ahead of a confirmation vote next week, other Republican moderates could follow Collins and announce support for Jackson. In particular, Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, has said he has not yet decided.  Jackson will replace Stephen Breyer when he retires this summer. As Breyer is a member of the outmatched liberal group on the court, his replacement will not alter the 6-3 conservative majority.  Republicans including the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have complained that Jackson would not take a position on calls from progressives to expand the court in order to redress its ideological balance, during confirmation hearings last week.  Speaking to the Times, Collins said: “In recent years, senators on both sides of the aisle have gotten away from what I perceive to be the appropriate process for evaluating judicial nominees.  “In my view, the role under the constitution assigned to the Senate is to look at the credentials, experience and qualifications of the nominee. It is not to assess whether a nominee reflects the individual ideology of a senator or would vote exactly as an individual senator would want.”  Supreme court confirmations have become highly political and increasingly rancorous.  In 2016, as Senate majority leader, McConnell refused even a hearing for Barack Obama’s final nominee, Merrick Garland, thereby holding a seat open in the hope it would be filled by a Republican president.  Collins duly voted to confirm Donald Trump’s first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, the beneficiary of such hardball tactics.  Collins also voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second nominee, who vehemently denied accusations of sexual assault.  But Collins voted not to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline conservative installed shortly before the 2020 presidential election in place of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal lion, in stark contravention of supposed principles about confirmations close to elections laid out by McConnell four years before.  During the Democratic primary in 2020, Joe Biden promised to put a Black woman on the supreme court. Some Republicans voiced opposition to such a promise, disregarding precedent including Trump’s vow to name a woman to replace Ginsburg.  In 2021, Collins was one of three Republicans who voted to confirm Jackson to a federal appeals court. The other two were Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – a hostile questioner in Jackson’s supreme court hearings – and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski has not said which way she will vote this time.  Explaining her vote to the Times, Collins cited Jackson’s “breadth of experience as a law clerk, attorney in private practice, federal public defender, member of the US Sentencing Commission and district court judge for more than eight years”.  In a tweet, the White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said: “Grateful to Senator Collins for giving fair, thoughtful consideration to Judge Jackson – and all of the president’s judicial nominations.”

Days after the regime claimed it had successfully tested its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), South Korea said it believed the launch had been faked.  The “monster missile”, the South’s military said, was in fact a Hwasong-15 – a smaller projectile previously tested in 2017, the last time Pyongyang fired missiles potentially capable of striking anywhere on the US mainland.  Even if last week’s launch, accompanied by a slick PR video showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in a black leather jacket and aviator shades, was not of the more powerful Hwasong-17, there is agreement that the weapon flew further and higher than any other in the history of Pyongyang’s missile tests.  The timing is significant, coming as US president Joe Biden’s attention is on the war in Ukraine – a reminder that North Korea’s sanctions-busting development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons is continuing with alarming speed.  01:27 Kim Jong-un appears in Hollywood-style film of missile launch on North Korean TV – video  “Pyongyang might have thought it was safe to test more provocative weapons without drawing penalties while Washington and the world are preoccupied with Ukraine,” said Duyeon Kim, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.  “North Korea usually has multiple objectives for every action. It may be gearing up for a tougher US-South Korea alliance after Yoon Suk-yeol’s presidential election victory while pushing ahead with preexisting plans to make hi-tech nuclear weapons as ordered by Kim Jong-un. It might also be aiming to mask any internal weakness through shows of strength before the North Korean people even if it has to be deceptive about them.”  Despite reports that a Hwasong-17 had exploded in midair over Pyongyang in mid-March, reportedly in view of shocked residents of the capital, every significant missile launch is partly intended for Kim’s domestic audience.

Photograph: KCNA VIA KNS/AFP/Getty Images  While the country battles food shortages and attempts to revive cross-border trade with China wrecked by two years of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, Kim habitually uses weapons tests as an opportunity to demonise the US and reinforce the belief among the country’s 25 million people that their greatest existential threat comes not from economic mismanagement but from the “imperialists” other side of the Pacific.  Above all, the first launch of an ICBM since November 2017 was a reminder to the US that despite years of UN security council sanctions, North Korea is quickly becoming a legitimate nuclear-armed state that Washington will have to treat as an equal if there is to be a return to Trump-era summitry.  Although Biden has shown little interest in meeting Kim, North Korea can point to an increasingly impressive inventory of weapons, from a purported hypersonic missiles and smaller short-range solid-fuel missiles targeting South Korea, as an inducement to talk. In addition, analysts say the North could be planning another nuclear test – its seventh – to claim it has acquired the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on those missiles.  “The offensive arithmetic will be in their favour soon; they may be able to keep up with advances in American defences,” Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said after the recent ICBM test.  The North’s diplomatic calculation is the same now as it was when Kim signed up to a nebulously worded agreement to “denuclearise” the Korean peninsula at his first summit with Trump in June 2018, even though few analysts believed he had any intention of relinquishing his most effective deterrent and most powerful bargaining chip.  Pyongyang’s goal seems to be to strengthen its leverage so it can turn denuclearisation talks into nuclear-reduction talks in exchange for economic aid. “The message of the North Korean readout of [the recent] ICBM launch is clear: North Korea will continue to develop its nuclear arsenal,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee at the Washington-based 38 North programme, which monitors North Korea.  After a four-year hiatus, analysts say the ICBM test could be the opening gambit in a new phase of provocations reminiscent of the “fire and fury” days of 2017.  “A nuclear test is possible,” Hyun-Wook Kim, professor and director-general at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, said, amid signs that work is under way to dig a shortcut to a tunnel at Punggye-ri, a nuclear test site the North “detonated” in 2018, weeks before Kim’s first summit with Trump.  “I think North Korea will use this opportunity to continue its military provocations as a way of getting something from both the US and China,” he added.  Duyeon Kim said it was “only a matter of time” before North Korea conducts a nuclear test, provided it stands to gain technologically or politically.  “North Korea has every reason to raise tensions on the peninsula to gain leverage ahead of any future negotiations with Washington and to be accepted by the world as a permanent nuclear power,” she said.

Her pieces are moments, scenes, statements, emotions, rendered in black afro textured hair. Ky is central to the art. Her sculptures can’t be displayed on a wall or a table. They can’t be bought or taken on tour. Every piece is on her head, extending high up into the space above and around her, a growth of coils and curls that she twists into shapes that seem unfathomable.  There are no gimmicks, technological cheats or shortcuts. Ivory Coast-born Ky, 25, doesn’t even create the sculpture on a flat surface or stand and then attach them to her head. She links hair extensions directly to her own natural fro and then, using a mirror, proceeds to mould both into shapes. If what she wants to build is particularly complicated, she uses wires and glue. This is even more remarkable considering the fact that her pieces range from the bucolic, to the domestic and the political. There are sculptures of household chores, where Ky’s hair extends into a vacuum cleaner she then grips to clean with; others where Ky is the body of an alligator, crawling out of a swamp, her hair the alligator’s head. There are more shocking ones, where Ky’s hair is a womb – on each side, instead of ovaries, there are two middle fingers – or a vagina with period blood pouring from it.  On a video call from her home town of Abidjn, Ky speaks slowly and deliberately, trying to pick the right word in English. Her hair falls long around her shoulders in twists. She describes in her book Love and Justice: A Journey of Empowerment, Activism and Embracing Black Beauty the long path she took to embrace her natural look. Finally accepting her hair was the start of her accepting many other things she had grown up to believe she had to change – her skin colour, her weight, her politics.  “Appreciating my hair let me appreciate other things that made me black,” she says. “Like my skin. I’m very dark-skinned and the beautiful Ivorian woman is supposed to be light-skinned. When I started to love my hair, I started to love my skin, and I started to love the fact that I was black. And when I started to love the fact that I was black, it helped me to love the fact that I was a woman. Loving one thing led me to love another thing.”  Through her art and activism – she studied business administration at university – Ky has found international acclaim, with almost half a million followers on Instagram and a social media contract with Elite Models under her partnership with TikTok. She has also moved into acting, appearing in Philippe Lacôte’s Night of the Kings, with another film role in the works.  ‘When you start to believe you’re valuable, you don’t accept injustice any more’ … Ky. Photograph: Laetitia Ky  But Ky didn’t always have the body confidence that has empowered her work. She started school much earlier than her peers. “I was three years younger than the [next] youngest person. When you’re young, you try to adapt to be at the level of others. It was hard when your school friends already had their periods and you were just a child.” They had “all the curves”, she says, while she was “just a slender child”. She was also a lot darker than her peers. “A lot of them were bleached. So not only am I dark-skinned and the standard is to be light-skinned. But also I am skinny, so I have nothing. I think maybe I was nine when my body image really started to go down.”  She began to binge eat and gained weight, too much as far as a certain boy she had a crush on was concerned. One day in class, he told her that she had a fat stomach. The class laughed. She was humiliated. It was “like a scene from a movie”, she says, and it sent her spiralling in the other direction. “I’m very extreme in everything I feel, everything I want. This was a shock. It shifted my mind in a couple of seconds.” Anorexia came at 13, then bulimia.  “I was just stuck,” she says, unable to find a way out of her illness. It was easy for her to hide it, even though her mother noticed she was losing weight. “I would always wear baggy clothes so she would not see the real deal. All my life revolved around food. I was scared of it. If there was a social thing, I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, I will have to eat something so that people don’t find me weird.’” Then she would start to plan: “Will I be able to go to the bathroom? Will I be able to throw up without people knowing? It was crazy.” Her mother caught her changing one day, and saw Ky’s emaciated body. Her distress was what Ky needed to find a way out, to spare her mother more pain.  This description is such a far cry from the Ky in her sculptures, and the one sitting in front of me, easy in her own skin. I ask her how she changed from the teen who hated her body.  “It definitely didn’t happen overnight,” she says. But where it really started, was with her hair. “I always had relaxed hair. I think I first used hair relaxer when I was five.” Then she saw a picture of Beyoncé with box braids and immediately went to get the same. “It was tight, I had never felt so much pain in my head. But I was loving it. It was pretty. And the rule here is if it’s not painful, then the hairstyle is not OK.” The tension, combined with the fragility of her hair, already damaged by relaxers, meant that she began to lose hair at her hairline. “It was terrifying, all the front of my hair was gone. I needed to hide it, so I did a weave, with some bangs; when I took the wig out, it was even worse.”  ‘Can you imagine living in a country full of black women and never seeing one with natural hair?’ … Ky. Photograph: Laetitia Ky  She started searching online for a solution and discovered the natural hair community in America. “I was just shocked. I was 16 and it was the first time I was seeing black women with their natural hair. Can you imagine living in a country full of black women, and I’ve never seen this before? I was amazed.” She cut off all her hair and told herself: “I will try to come to natural and see what will happen.” That decision unlocked something else. “This is where everything started.”  While her hair grew she started following social media accounts promoting the black aesthetic, including one on Facebook that posted about African culture before colonisation. “One day,” she says, the account featured a photo album of “African women prior to colonisation. Their hair was just [she gestures upwards from her head] ooop! It was also sculpture, decorated with beads. The shape they were able to give to their hair … I was very curious. How did they do this? I felt like I needed to experience myself how to create some shape too.” She teased her hair with extensions into a high column and posted it online. It got more attention than she expected, so she made some more shapes and posted again. “I was trying to push a little bit further every time I was posting, and the attention got bigger and bigger all the time.”  When Ky first started posting on social media, she tells me she began receiving messages from women thanking her for her work and saying it was the first time they had seen a black woman so proud that she had turned herself into art. “I started to realise that maybe what I was doing was more powerful than I thought it was,” Ky says. “If I really try to use it to share what is important for me, it can make a difference.” Initially her pieces were about gender equality rather than race, “because growing up in Ivory Coast, this did not seem as much of an issue.” She began to explore racial issues after there was international interest in this element of her art.  ‘My parents never tried to make sex a taboo for me and my sister’ … Ky. Photograph: Laetitia Ky  Her ability to question sexual taboos was seeded by her family, thanks to her unusually liberal parents. They separated when Ky was young but both tried to ensure that Ky felt comfortable with her body and sexuality, despite Ky’s mother being from a very strict family. “On my first day of college,” she says, “my dad took a box of condoms and gave it to me, saying: ‘It will happen there. Make sure you protect yourself.’ It was so awkward. I wanted to hide. My parents never tried to make sex a taboo for me and my sister.”  The response to her work has been unexpected, both at home and abroad. In Ivory Coast, she was surprised to discover that “some women share the same beliefs but weren’t bold enough to tell it out loud”. Others, she says, predictably “freaked out” when she talked or made art about abortion, for example, telling her: “I love what you create but I don’t like what you say.” But what really took Ky by surprise was how her work got caught up in the slipstream of a western discourse about gender identification. Her focus on the punishment of biological womanhood has attracted comments that she is excluding trans women from her feminism. Ky is upfront about how the context is unfamiliar to her. “I’m not gonna lie, I don’t fully understand it. But in Ivory Coast we have things like excision, we have things like breast flattening. So when I come out there trying to express all this and someone tells me sex doesn’t exist, only gender exists, I’m like: ‘What are you saying? Sorry, but no.’”  She explains that her anger on this issue is about her work being critiqued by what she believes is a self-centred western issue. She also hears from western women who thank her for saying women have wombs. “Every time I talk about sex as a reason of oppression of African women, some western people get mad. And I’m always like: ‘I’m sorry, maybe your experience is different but I’m not going to shut myself up to make you feel better about your convictions. Because those things are really happening where I come from. I also understand they have an experience I don’t have, so maybe what they think is OK concerning their experience. I’m talking about me. If it was different for you, that’s cool. I think inclusivity is a very good thing. I’m a black woman.”  Ky seems broadly unshaken by any criticism, either at home or abroad. “I have learned to be very strong. I surround myself with people who agree with me.” She bats away social censure constantly about her life choices, from not shaving her armpits to not wanting children or marriage, in a society where these things are non-negotiable milestones for women. “I’ve never felt the need to have children or to be married,” she says, breezily. “Maybe it’s because I’ve never been around a successful marriage in my life. Of course I am interested in finding love. I want to find someone I will grow and build things with. I don’t think we necessarily need to be married.”  At such a young age, Ky speaks as if her work is done. Her focus now is on others. “I want to inspire other women to speak,” she says. “When you start to believe you’re valuable, that you’re worth something, you don’t accept injustice any more. You want respect. You want to be free.”  Love and Justice: A Journey of Empowerment, Activism, and Embracing Black Beauty by Laetitia Ky (Princeton Architectural Press, £19.99) is published 5 April

His band Simple Minds were in Copenhagen, 10 dates into a world tour, when all the remaining shows were cancelled because of Covid. Kerr returned to Glasgow and supermarkets lined with empty shelves. “It was like the first time I’d gone to East Germany in 1978,” he chuckles. “All that was left were cabbages and broccoli. I reached for the last cabbage and a woman burst in front of me and grabbed it. Two nights before, I’d been a rock star. I thought: ‘What happened to my life?’”  In fairness, that’s a question he could have asked many times since 1977, when he began his journey to stardom from a tower block in Glasgow’s Toryglen. Kerr and his old pal Bono virtually wrote the job description for “stadium rock god”, but Kerr was the last person you’d have expected to become one. In his teens, no one knew people in bands and he felt “you had more chance of becoming an astronaut”. He was painfully introverted and spoke with a stammer.  Simple Minds’ first gig in Glasgow, 1978. Photograph: Laurie Evans  “Having met Peter Gabriel and all of these people that are 10 times more successful than I’ve been,” Kerr reflects, “quite a lot of them are freaks or introverts. I was never bullied, because my dad got me a set of boxing gloves, but outside of my circle I would never speak. When you’re quiet, you notice things that other people maybe aren’t noticing. I had my own dialogue going on in my head.”  In January, Simple Minds released the single Act of Love, written in 1978 but never recorded because it was drowned out by so much other music. “It was the first song where I thought Simple Minds had a chance,” Kerr remembers, describing how the then 18-year old guitarist Charlie Burchill came up with the riff and he thought: “Fucking hell! We’ve got a shot!”  Kerr in Berlin in 1980. Photograph: Ronnie Gurr  Today, the 62-year old Kerr is video-calling from a holiday home in France, grabbing a short break prior to the rescheduled 40 Years of Hits tour. His eyes sparkle with the enthusiasm that took him from Toryglen to the world. As he puts it: “That sense of wonder is still in what we do.”  Punk had left remnants. People were starting their own magazines or conjuring up the money to make a movie  The son of an Irish builder’s labourer and a factory machinist, Kerr first had his horizons broadened when the family moved from the tenements of the Gorbals to that 11th-floor flat in Toryglen, and he rejects the popular view of high-rise living as a living hell. “It had central heating and elevators,” he says. “Heroin hadn’t turned up yet. There were jobs. It was the modern world.” The building’s older teens would return suntanned from places such as Jaipur or Morocco, clutching Van Der Graaf Generator albums or The Tibetan Book of the Dead. “I am being poetic here, but it seemed the whole world was out there.”  He was working as a butcher’s boy when David Bowie played a Ziggy Stardust-era gig in Glasgow. Kerr missed that after injuring himself standing on a rusty nail, but he did see Foxtrot-era Genesis, Roxy Music and Lou Reed. The pivotal incident came with the onset of punk. He and Burchill hitchhiked to London to try to see the Sex Pistols, but a truck driver said he was going to Paris, and would they like to go there instead? “We knew Patti Smith was playing in Paris, and in those days you could get a temporary passport,” says Kerr. “We’d read Jack Kerouac and we were On the Road.” They missed the gig, but ended up spending a month hitching through France, Belgium and Holland. As he puts it: “It felt like you could stick out your thumb and find emancipation.”  Five minutes before we’re on at Live Aid and where’s my father? ‘Oh, I was with Bob Dylan and he’s steaming!’  After four albums of starkly entrancing dancefloor-friendly post-punk, 1982’s Promised You a Miracle gave Simple Minds their first hit. Kerr sang “Everything is possible”, and the rest of their sublime fifth album New Gold Dream radiated youthful possibility against a background of mass unemployment and the Falklands war.  Was there so little optimism that he had to conjure up his own? “I’m not entirely sure where it came from,” Kerr says, “but I know from meeting contemporaries in other cities like [Echo and the Bunnymen’s] Ian McCulloch or [Associates singer] Billy Mackenzie, we all felt the same. Punk had left remnants. People were starting their own magazines or somehow conjuring up the money to make a movie or a documentary. Suddenly, things were regional, whether it was Tony Wilson’s Factory Records in Manchester or the Sheffield bands once they got their hands on synthesisers. In journalism, [NME’s] Paul Morley would review the new Dollar single and mention a Yukio Mishima novel. You could see the ingredients of Simple Minds – Magazine and Ultravox – but people like Boy George or Morrissey were truly unique. There was this idea of self-invention, the potency of imagination.”  Kerr hadn’t left the tower block long when Don’t You (Forget About Me) rocketed to the top of the US charts, after featuring in John Hughes’s 1985 film The Breakfast Club. Famously, the band didn’t want to record it for the film, only relenting because songwriter Keith Forsey came up to see them. They took him to the pub and really liked him. But suddenly Simple Minds were what he calls “definitely one of the bands of our generation”. They had three consecutive UK No 1 albums between 1984 and 1989. Kerr is modest – but not falsely modest. “Who would have thought that MTV would come along and put us in every living room in the world?”  Kerr on stage at Live Aid. Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty  Live Aid, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure’s 1985 concert for Ethiopian famine relief, broadcast from stadiums in the UK and US, showcased what he calls “the side of me that I haven’t mentioned, that thinks: ‘The biggest event since the moon landing. We’re just gonna fucking blow people away.’ We were young and No 1 in America and fancied our chances.”  He can’t describe what it actually feels like to sing for 1.9 billion people (90,000 of them in Philadelphia’s JFK stadium, where Simple Minds were on the bill for the US event) because the day passed in a blur. His vivid memory is of his father, who had flown in from Glasgow. “He’d stopped drinking by then – when I was young, he drank enough! – but was still the sort of guy that would meet a taxi driver and become best mates. Anyway, five minutes before we’re on – no mobile phones back then – where’s my fucking father? He turned up and said: ‘Oh, I was with Dylan.’ I’m thinking: ‘Is that one of the roadies?’ He goes: ‘Fucking Dylan!’ It turned out he’d wandered off and got talking to Bob Dylan about folk music but he went: ‘Great fella, but I’m a bit worried because he’s going onstage with Keith Richards later and the pair of them are steaming.’” He beams at the memory of his “best pal”. Before his father died aged 83 in 2019, Kerr returned to Glasgow to share every day of his final 10 months .  Kerr with second wife Patsy Kensit in 1995.

Legend has it he met both of them in hotel lifts, but he points out that with Hynde (to whom he was married between 1984 and 1990) he was waiting for the lift. “I was surrounded by fans, trying not to make eye contact. I kept hearing this voice and it was Chrissie, taking the piss. Her dad has Scottish roots, we got chatting and – what can I say? – Cupid intervened.”  Kerr and Kensit – married from 1992 to 1996 – met in Spain, where she was filming. “I met her in the elevator and she said: ‘I’m utterly bored here.’ I said: ‘Why not come out with us?’” But he loathed the accompanying lifestyle of being in Hello! magazine or being invited to one of Michael Winner’s dinners with guests such as Arnold Schwarzenegger. “She said: ‘Don’t you understand? This is my job!’ I’m not being disparaging to her, but none of that appealed to me whatsoever.”  In the late 80s and 90s, with pop fired up by Live Aid, Kerr opted for activism as Simple Minds toured for Amnesty International and performed at the two giant concerts for Nelson Mandela, one marking his 70th birthday, the other celebrating the ANC leader’s release from prison. It wasn’t a big stretch: Kerr’s family were socialists (“Everyone in Scotland voted Labour”), and he had been “profoundly affected” by seeing ancient slavery ports on holiday in Senegal.  “The [Thatcher] government was dragging its feet over apartheid and calling Mandela a terrorist,” he says. “I wanted to use my platform for more than selling records or merchandise.” He admits to “conflicted” feelings over whether rock stars should try to heal the world until Mandela gathered all the artists and told them: “This is a brilliant thing. When there was no voice allowed, the voice of the artist gave us the oxygen we needed.” Kerr accepts that “singers, writers, journalists and film-makers” helped end apartheid, but isn’t self-congratulatory, saying: “Others died or went to prison. We just turned up for 15 minutes.”  Pop subsequently turned away from huge-scale activism, and Kerr notes: “People get wary of rock stars lecturing them.” Nevertheless, he mentions being “in conversations” about a benefit concert – announced after we speak – for Ukraine.  On tour, Simple Minds will perform 1980’s I Travel, an uncannily current-sounding song about strife in central Europe. “We were cold war kids,” he says. “Everywhere we toured, it seemed like Europe was on fire, whether it was bombs in Bologna train station or a synagogue in Paris the day after we left, or the Baader-Meinhof gang, or the IRA. I sang ‘Tragedies, luxuries, statues, parks and galleries’ because all that stuff was going on in these otherwise cultural centres. So I suppose that song has found its time again.”  The same could be said for Simple Minds. After a rocky period in the early 2000s when Kerr remembers “driving in a minibus past stadiums we used to sell out en route to a club that’s not sold out”, they decided not to “go around like punch-drunk boxers, just doing it because we don’t know what else to do”, and instead revitalised the band with a postmodern reboot. Their last album, 2018’s Walk Between Worlds, reached No 4 in the UK. Kerr spent the pandemic working on a memoir and enough songs for a double album. The gigs are getting bigger, too: Simple Minds are back in arenas, which Kerr finds “intimate – not too cavernous”.  Today’s seven-piece touring lineup includes three women. “And no mullets,” Kerr says, laughing, although he points out that Simple Minds had a female vocalist, Robin Clark, in the 80s. “But if you look around most organisations now there are women, and you don’t get more macho than rock bands. We never thought: ‘Which boxes do we tick?’, but everyone needs to strap on new engines.”  When not on global jaunts, Kerr divides his time between Glasgow and Taormina, Sicily, where he built a hotel, after deciding that one day he would live in Italy during a school trip to Rimini when he was 13. Only Kerr and Burchill remain from the five-piece that played to hails of bottles in Dunfermline, or recorded their debut single Life in a Day in 1978, but Kerr feels like their great teenage adventure never stopped. “This is who we are and what we do,” he says. “It’s the prism through which we try to make sense of the world.”  The 40 Years of Hits tour starts at Wembley Arena, London on 31 March. Simple Minds perform their album New Gold Dream in its entirety at Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh on 13 August for Unicef and the children of Ukraine.

Indeed, it is a long way from anywhere, at least viewed through western eyes. To reach the gentle herd of reindeer who are now feeding under the long pale glow of an Arctic sunset, I have ridden for three and a half hours across the snowy wastes, partly in a sled and partly on the back of a snowmobile, pausing halfway at a herders’ hut (no electricity, no water, but nevertheless a cosy refuge). We are somewhere off the road that links the villages of Karasjok and Kautokeino. To the north of us is Hammerfest. North of that, the Barents Sea.  Artist Máret Ánne Sara is with her husband, brother and 18-month-old, the child cheerfully bundled up and goggled against the chill and the snow’s bright glare. She is telling me about the yearly passage of these, her brother’s reindeer, from the tundra up to the northern coastal summer lands, 250km away: how the biggest cow will start to move when she’s heavily pregnant, and the whole herd will inexorably, mysteriously make its way north. “It’s the animals who control everything,” she says. “We just follow them and try to keep them safe.”  Her brother Jovsset Ante Sara is scattering feed as the soft-haired animals prance and jitter across the snow. That’s not a good sign: reindeer have always been able to eat lichen and moss through the Arctic winters, but the unstable climate is increasingly bringing snow that’s too deep for them to find it, as it has this year. Or, as in 2019, periods of warmth that melt the snow, so that when temperatures drop again, impenetrable layers of ice form, keeping the animals from reaching food.  The tundra is changing in other ways, too: as winters get warmer, birchwoods are spreading north by as much as 50 metres a year. “When we have birch forests, the ground changes and the lichen gets pushed out,” says Sara. “If the landscape keeps changing, they won’t have any winter food.” She looks around at the short but sturdy birches. “If you look up historical photos, there are no trees here.”  Courthouse protest … a sculpture made of 200 bloodied reindeer heads by Máret Ánne Sara. Photograph: Iris Egilsdatter  Reindeer herding is one of the traditional livelihoods for Sámi families such as the Saras. The Sámi are an Indigenous people scattered thinly through a vast tract of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia’s Kola peninsula. Their presence long predates the Nordic settlers of these boreal lands, who now outnumber them. Their homeland is called Sápmi in the Sámi languages, nine of which survive, some clinging on to life with just a few hundred speakers.  For this year’s Venice Biennale, the Nordic Pavilion will be renamed the Sámi Pavilion, and a long colonised people, divided by borders and living at the sharp end of climate crisis, will take their place as a nation for the first time at the art world’s most prominent global gathering – a gathering that, because of its exhibitions presented in national pavilions, can feel like a kind of art Olympics, always entangled in the geopolitics of the moment.  What do reindeer on the tundra have to do with Máret Anne Sara’s art for the Venice Biennale? Everything. For her, reindeer are both the subject and the material of her work; indeed, they are central to life itself. For reindeer-herding families, the animals are not mere livestock. “There’s a different way of thinking and being between an Indigenous perspective and a typical western orientation,” she says. “For us, the reindeer is actually a very close relative. Humans, nature and animals are interdependent and equal. So destroying any part of this is like suicide from our perspective. What’s happening to the reindeer is our story as well.” The director of the Sámi Museum at Karasjok, Jelena Porsanger, had earlier told me how this proximity is even embedded in the northern Sámi language. “To live” – eallit – has the same derivation as the noun “herd” – eallu.  It is not a sentimental relationship, though. While I’m on the tundra, a couple of reindeer are quietly and efficiently slaughtered, “for domestic use”, says Sara; and at the herders’ hut, her brother Jovsset slices chunks of dried reindeer meat as a snack. Ande Somby, a Sámi activist, lawyer and artist whom I meet in the city of Alta a few days later, tells me that between the herder and the reindeer there is a kind of contract, “that the reindeer will be given a death of dignity and everything shall be used” – bones, hide, meat, antlers.  Somby is in his 60s, of the generation of Norwegian Sámi sent away to boarding school and chastised for speaking his mother tongue. Things are different now, with Sámi parliaments in the Nordic nations giving people a say in cultural, linguistic and educational matters. Somby is a yoiker: practitioner of a haunting, uncanny vocal technique in which the singer embodies, almost becomes, the subject of the yoik, which could be a person, a landscape, a wolf, or indeed a reindeer.  Some of Sara’s most powerful art has been made as a means of protest. For years, Jovsset Ante Sara was locked in a legal battle over the government’s policy of culling herds because – it was argued – of overgrazing. Sara denies that overgrazing is an issue, and anyway, she says, “it is very difficult for us to accept that argument, because the government is at the same time inviting big industries into the same area”.  A long history of mineral exploitation in Sápmi now also extends to building windfarms on traditional reindeer-herding lands, which spooks the reindeer and affects their traditional migratory patterns. It is complicated: clearly, now more than ever, wind energy is needed to help replace fossil fuels. But the Sámi, as so often, find themselves paying a high price for the high-carbon lifestyles of others.  Ironic twist … Sara and the curtain of 400 skulls that has now been acquired by the National Museum of Oslo. Photograph: Máret Ánne Sara  As Jovsset’s case against the forcible slaughter of reindeer rose through the courts, Sara’s confrontational art accompanied it. She erected a pile of 200 bloodied, frozen reindeer heads with the Norwegian flag atop it near the courthouse in Tana. In front of the Norwegian parliament building in Oslo, she made a huge sculpture, a kind of “curtain” of 400 reindeer skulls, each with a bullet hole – a work that formed part of a greater project of documents, talks and debates she called Pile O’Sapmi.  Jovsset won every case until, at the last, he was defeated in the Supreme Court in 2017. “It showed how fragile we are, and how our rights are owned, totally, by the state,” says Sara. It was what happens, she says, “when an outside worldview criminalises your traditions and capitalises nature”. It is an irony, perhaps, that the new National Museum of Oslo has acquired that “curtain” of skulls and, when it opens its doors in June, this howl of protest against internal colonialism will be the first thing visitors see.  Sara tells me how, some time after the legal defeat when she was at a loss to find a way forward, she was talking to another herder, describing her disappointment and exhaustion. “All of a sudden he said, ‘But now the red calf is coming. And at the first sight of the red calf, everything is forgotten.’” It was a transformational moment. What he meant was that when the new reindeer are born – “the red calves” – they bring joy and a fresh beginning. Sara’s new work takes its cue from this sense of renewal but, like everything in her art, it is shot through with darkness. The losses of calves to legally protected predators such as wolverines and eagles are huge, and her work, which often teeters on the edge of the macabre, will use their mutilated bodies as material.  Pauliina Feodoroff is another artist representing Sápmi at the Venice Biennale who has a strong need to find hope in the dark. She is one of the 1,000 or so-strong Skolt Sámi community from close to the Finnish-Russian border, of whom around 300 speak the Skolt Sámi language. Feodoroff learned it in adulthood, “taking back” the tongue, like a number of her generation in their 30s and 40s. Many Skolt Sámi ancestral lands were long ago lost to the hellish, polluting nickel mines of Murmansk. But, says Feodoroff – whose background is in performance and choreography as well as politics and land guardianship – “for myself I want to focus on what is healthy and our need to be kind and gentle to ourselves and others”.  ‘The trees are our cathedrals, our libraries, our museums’ … artist Pauliina Feodoroff. Photograph: Michael Miller / OCA  Feodoroff is speaking on the edge of the river Näätämö – or Njâuddam in Skolt Sami – north of Finland’s Lake Inari. She offers a greeting to the “grandmother” river and suggests that I introduce myself to the landscape by lying near the riverbank in the snow for a moment – which I do, staring into the heavy white sky and listening to the intense silence, broken only by the caw of a crow and the fussing of a couple of willow tits in the birches. The animistic, nature-based spirituality of the Sámi did not entirely die with the aggressive Christianising process of the 17th century, when Sámi noaidis, or shamans, were tried for witchcraft.  Later that day we cross the frozen lake Inari on sleds and enter the pristine, ancient pine forests that circle it – deep woods where the trees stand at a dignified, discreet distance from each other to take in as much of the precious Arctic light as possible. “This is our cultural monument,” says Feodoroff of the forest. “It is our cathedrals, our libraries, our museums.”  She has been fighting to preserve these forests, which are threatened by logging for the pulp industry, despite their antiquity, their biodiversity and their dark green, spreading beauty. Part of her work for Venice will be a conceptual project in which she will auction the right to see views of wilderness like this, and use the proceeds to buy and protect the land in a case of art and practical activism combining. When institutional or legal processes have ground to a halt, she says, “art is a space that can cause some kind of freedom of movement”.  In the forest we sit round a campfire and listen to Feodoroff’s friend, Anna Morottaja, one of the Inari Sámi, talking about her people’s traditional singing style the livđe, an art that had virtually disappeared from her community’s culture until she researched ethnomusicological collections in Berlin and elsewhere to find recordings of long-lost family members performing for the benefit of curious anthropologists. Like the yoik, the livđe can involve creating a kind of portrait of a person. Hearing an archive recording of her great-aunt’s livđe for the first time was, then, like a personal encounter. She sings it now, in the dusk and the snow, before the campfire, and it’s an unearthly thing with a rocking rhythm like a spell, but tinged with wit, telling of an energetic woman with “fire in her hemline”.  A song sung in the forest seems an enchanting and simple thing, but none of this really is simple. The Sámi were long victims of racism and prejudice. Northern Sámi activist and film-maker Siljá Somby later tells me that it’s still very much there. You can see plenty of hate speech directed at the Sámi on social media. The situation varies from country to country. Sweden has not signed the UN convention on Indigenous peoples, meaning the Swedish Sámi have fewer rights than those in Norway and Finland. For Venice, the Swedish side of Sápmi will be represented by painter Anders Sunna, another member of a reindeer-herding family that has been locked in legal battles for years with the state.  We never resist, we always bend. When it comes to nature, that’s the right thing to do  Even in Norway and Finland, points out Siljá Somby, the parliaments stop short of giving them what she calls “hard rights” over land or water, only “soft rights” over culture and education. And there are plenty of divisions within the Sámi community itself. Some have little time for the sharpening, over the last 50 years or so, of Sámi political consciousness, and those elected to the Norwegian Sámi parliament have included members of the Progress party, who would see the institution itself abolished. Nor has resistance come naturally to the Sámi, who for centuries adapted themselves to circumstances.  Inari Sámi reindeer herder Osmo Seurujärvi, has, like Morottaja, immersed himself in a language and way of life that his own parents were becoming estranged from, realising that if he did not, the chain would end and his children would lose the culture for ever. “We never resist, we always bend,” he says. “When it comes to nature, that’s the right thing to do. But when it comes to social structures, it’s not always the right thing. It’s always expected that Sámi will give up and not resist. We are not a warrior nation. But we do need to have a say.”  Everything is connected: this is what the Sámi tell us. The landscape, nature, the climate, politics, culture, society, the law, art – they are all entangled. Like Indigenous peoples from other parts of the world, the Sámi are at the front line of climate crisis but also the holders of knowledge; of alternative perspectives that could usefully challenge the consumerist, capitalist structures that have proved so destructive. And, as Feodoroff points out, we all rely on the Sámi and their breathtaking, expansive landscapes in more ways than we might at first think. “The forests here are storing carbon for you guys, too,” she says. “If they cease to exist, the consequences will come to your back door.”  The Sámi Pavilion at the Venice Biennale opens on 23 April.

Fans hear in his lyrics whatever they feel but can’t express. Among the ones I have heard roared back to him at gigs: “People say friends don’t destroy one another, what do they know about friends?”  “I actually think that they’re not your friends if they destroy you,” he tells me from his home in Durham, North Carolina. “But the function of a line like that is that, well, that’s how it feels sometimes.”  Recording as the Mountain Goats since 1991, Darnielle, 55, has made 20 studio albums under that name, the most recent being last year’s Dark in Here. He has also, for the past decade, been writing novels. It is a jump few singer-songwriters manage, but Wolf in White Van (2014), his first novel, was a New York Times bestseller, and Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro has called his work “beautifully etched”.  Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.  Darnielle’s third novel, Devil House, is published this month. It follows Gage Chandler, a true-crime writer said to be descended from kings, as he immerses himself in a murder case that took place at the eponymous Devil House, in the California town of Milpitas. Darnielle, who was born in Indiana but grew up in California, lived in Milpitas as a child. While the dark underbelly of the golden west chronicled by his foremost stylistic influence, Joan Didion, would appear to be front and centre in Devil House, Darnielle says he actually used gentler childhood memories – such as the bayside restaurant that housed a seal called Sam – for the book.  Devil House skewers our current lust for true crime, but the idea for the novel emerged when Darnielle heard about “castle doctrine”, a “very old law that presently is being used by American gun enthusiasts to mean that I get to shoot you if you step on to my property and I’m scared of you”. Once it was a statute that made it legal for kings to kill anyone in their castle. A reader of medieval English chroniclers such as Thomas Malory and Geoffrey of Monmouth, Darnielle started with a character who has always been told he’s descended from kings and went from there.  His urge to dig back into the history of castle doctrine was partly political. Darnielle says the way it is being used in the US today is “all about giving white people an excuse to shoot black people”, and that this demanded interrogation. “My politics, in American terms, are far left,” he tells me. “It just seems clear, I think, to anybody, that the problems we are facing societally aren’t going to be solved by the free market.”  Darnielle and his wife, Lalitree, who works for an academic publisher, have two children, Roman, 10, and Moses, seven. After Darnielle became a father, he wondered how it was possible that one in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of giving birth. “And the answer is – because Samuel Beckett saw this coming – you’re just going to keep doing it,” he says. “You ask what it’s like to be an American. And it’s like living in any sort of Terry Gilliam-like world, where you go: ‘There’s too many things to be mad about, and there’s only one me, so perhaps I’ll read a little Tolstoy.’”  The Monutain Goats. Photograph: Jade Wilson  For Darnielle, “the most good for the most people seems like a good principle. In America you can’t say that without people saying: ‘So then you are apologising for Stalin!’ which I’m not,” he laughs. In fact, Darnielle grew up with a stepfather he describes as “a Stalin apologist”, a member of the Communist party with whom he had a complicated relationship.  In 2005, the Mountain Goats released The Sunset Tree, an album that told the story of Darnielle’s abusive childhood. In the liner notes, Darnielle wrote that the album was “made possible by my stepfather, Mike Noonan (1940-2004): may the peace which eluded you in life be yours now”. The record was dedicated to young victims of abuse.  “To me, the first thing that’s true about him is that he hit his wife and child,” Darnielle says today of his stepfather. “That’s the most important fact about him. But also, I wouldn’t even be acquainted with these progressive values without this guy.”  The Sunset Tree, Darnielle says, “chooses not to try to present too much of that side of the picture because I’m sharing my story in the hopes that it helps other people. My first impulse when he died was to share that feeling of liberation. You know, that was the feeling I had: the guy who used to hit you will never do it again.”  Darnielle’s parents separated when he was five and from his father, a Catholic jazz musician, he got something else that anchors his worldview: Christianity. Twice in our conversation, Darnielle says we are living in a “post-Dover Beach world”, referencing Matthew Arnold’s 1867 poem. “The sea of faith has receded, and we all suspect – the most believing God-believing among us – has a deep suspicion that there’s nothing out there. That this is it. That we are an accident,” he says.  And yet Darnielle prays to Jesus Christ and sometimes does a bit of Hare Krishna chanting. “My wife’s in the next room having to bite through her lip because she hates this whole shtick to pieces,” he says at the end of a CS Lewis-inspired disquisition on faith and emotion. “I see her point, which is: you just like it because it makes you cry. And it’s true! I’m a person who likes to ferret out something beautiful that makes me cry.”  Able to apply this kind of critical thinking to himself, Darnielle can exercise it on his peers. “One of my longstanding tendencies is calling nostalgia toxic poison,” he says. “I cannot stand to hear people say how much better anything was when they were young. Because what was better, was that you were young.”  As a novelist, he says, he feels young, and while on the one hand he aspires to be like Donna Tartt and “be read for centuries to come”, on the other he likes to “imagine my work being forgotten. And then later, somebody saying: ‘You know who was kind of cool? This guy who’s out of print.’”  Devil House by John Darnielle is out now, published by Scribe.

Sadly, there is no identifiable progressive vision. Labor governments since the 1980s have usually promoted a combination of multilateralism and economic globalisation. Neither is viable now.  Today, increasingly belligerent great powers undermine established international institutions.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that rapprochement is unlikely soon. Globalisation is fracturing, hastened by the west’s sanctions on Russia.  Closer to home, Australia’s relationship with its biggest trading partner, China, has never been worse, while the pandemic has exposed the dangers of long supply chains – a result of yesteryear’s economic liberalisation.  In this fragmented and dangerous world, Labor has little different to offer. This is partly because Albanese and his senior colleagues are pursuing a “small target” campaign and offer few new ideas on most things. It also reflects Labor’s fear of appearing weak on national security – an anxiety on which the government is seeking to play with its crude attacks on China – even though the parties’ positions are nearly identical.  Nonetheless, new progressive foreign policy ideas are absent globally. Labor is not alone.  In a new article in the Australian Journal of International Affairs, co-authored with four other colleagues, we argue that the key to this is a “progressive realism”.  Our starting point is a pragmatic, “realist”, assessment of the main dynamics that shape modern international relations. Governments can only provide security, basic needs, and sustainable development by facing unflinchingly the realities of world politics. This means paying attention to changing distributions of power among states, but also to the contours of global value chains and the impacts of human-induced climate change, for example.  This is followed by a progressive second step. Rather than accepting the world as it is, a progressive foreign policy should seek to redistribute existing power configurations.  In recent years, progressive movements have focused more on issues of identity and inclusion and not enough on redistribution. This is a mistake. If progressive politics stands for anything, it is a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and life-chances.  Placing a redistributive logic at the heart of order-building activities recognises that any global order premised on unequal, unjust distributions of wealth, power and status will be neither stable nor sustainable.  Practice and ethics must, therefore, go together. Without first assessing do-ability, realising progressive goals is impossible. Combined, these two building blocks provide the foundations for a “progressive realism”; the basis for a left-of-centre foreign policy agenda.  What would that mean in practice? For example, the recent leaked draft security agreement between Solomon Islands and China has put a spotlight on Australia’s relationship with Pacific island countries. If implemented, the agreement could potentially allow China to base ships in Solomon Islands, 2,000km from Australia.  While its status is uncertain, Australia should work hard to prevent this agreement or similar from being signed with any Pacific country. It would profoundly transform and destabilise Pacific’s security order hence intensifying the pressure on Australia’s defence planning enormously.  Nonetheless, Solomon Islands is a sovereign state and Australian policymakers would do well to ask themselves why its government would entertain this deal in the first place. Many Australian commentators have blamed Chinese “chequebook diplomacy”, casting Solomon Islands as the gullible party. Solomon Islanders, however, are not “dupes”.  Pacific governments do not necessarily see the world like Australia. While Australia views China as a global bully, Pacific governments perceive Chinese engagement as giving them more leverage vis-a-vis Australia; the region’s hegemon.  As the Pacific’s biggest aid donor, Australia has often taken a heavy-handed approach, trying to dictate to Pacific islanders how to run their governments and public institutions. Much of its aid also ended up in the pockets of Australian companies and consultants. Many in the region resent this. Chinese presence constrains Australian paternalism. It has also led Australia to pledge more money for infrastructure, which the Pacific sorely needs.  Additionally, while Australia sees China as its biggest security threat, the Pacific associates that level of danger with climate change, not China.  Australia’s dismal approach to climate change mitigation, and disapproval of Pacific climate activism, rankles. Granted, China is not itself a climate change paragon, but Australia’s claim to regional leadership has been harmed.  A progressive-realist approach would recognise that China is in the region to stay, because Pacific governments want it there. Hence, leading in the Pacific does not mean kicking China out, as efforts to achieve this would probably backfire.  Any global order premised on unequal, unjust distributions of wealth, power and status will be neither stable nor sustainable  Australia must take Pacific countries’ preferences and needs seriously. It needs to accommodate, even engage, China in areas that benefit the Pacific, and only compete where Australian security is clearly jeopardised, as with the aforementioned draft agreement. Australia could also empower Pacific sovereignty by supporting governments and civil society’s capacity to analyse debt sustainability and increase the transparency of Chinese-financed projects.  Australia also should support Pacific countries’ capacity to shape regional policy agendas. To continue to use the Pacific Islands Forum to drive through Australia’s security and trade goals only heightens regional resentments. Short-termism should be replaced with a long-term commitment to partnership.  A second plank of a progressive realist foreign policy in the Pacific would involve a shift in Australia’s climate change stance.  If Australia took climate action seriously, this alone would strengthen its leadership claims. This could be bolstered by allocating substantial financial resources to supporting climate adaptation, which should become the focus of Australia’s Pacific financing facility. This redistributive approach recognises the immediacy of the timelines that Pacific countries face in ensuring their own resilience, even survival, in a climate transformed future.  Progressive realism provides the means for a long-term vision focused on maximising Australian influence over a range of strategic issues. We do not claim to have all the answers, but Australia must have an urgent debate over its foreign policy agenda. The left must play its part.

Insisting that the victims of bombings are “crisis actors”, spreading falsehoods about chemical weapons, justifying the mass murder of civilians by claiming that anyone who resists is a “Nazi” (in Ukraine) or a “head-chopper” (in Syria): its disinformation tactics have been tested and honed.  This organised lying has more or less destroyed the US left, and severely damaged the European left. As the activist Terry Burke documented in 2019, effective leftwing opposition to Donald Trump collapsed amid furious internal disputes about Syria and Russian interference in US politics, triggered by prominent figures reciting Kremlin falsehoods. Some of them turned out to be paid by the Russian government.  Such lies are also familiar to Ukrainians. During the Holodomor (the famine in the 1930s exacerbated by Joseph Stalin’s policies), in which between 3 and 5 million people are believed to have died, the Kremlin line was that the peasants had plenty of food but were hiding it. In some cases, they were deliberately starving themselves to death. I guess you could call it method crisis acting.  The current Russian disinformation machine has been widely blamed for what we now see as an “epistemic crisis” – the collapse of a shared acceptance of the means by which truth is discerned.  We should contest and expose the Kremlin’s lying. But to suggest that the public assault on truth is new, or peculiarly Russian, is also disinformation. For generations, in countries such as the UK there was no epistemic crisis – but this was not because we shared a commitment to truth. It was because we shared a commitment to outrageous lies.  As I’ve mentioned the Holodomor, let’s take a look at another exacerbated famine: in Bengal in 1943-1944. About 3 million people died. As in Ukraine, natural and political events made people vulnerable to hunger. But here too, government policy transformed the crisis into a catastrophe. Research by the Indian economist Utsa Patnaik suggests the inflation that pushed food out of reach of the poor was deliberately engineered under a policy conceived by that hero of British liberalism, John Maynard Keynes. The colonial authorities used inflation, as Keynes remarked, to “reduce the consumption of the poor” in order to extract wealth to support the war effort. Until Patnaik’s research was published in 2018, we were unaware of the extent to which Bengal’s famine was constructed. Britain’s cover-up was more effective than Stalin’s.  The famines engineered by the viceroy of India, Lord Lytton, in the 1870s are even less well-known, though, according to Mike Davis’s book Late Victorian Holocausts, they killed between 12 and 29 million people. Only when Caroline Elkins’s book, Britain’s Gulag, was published in 2005 did we discover that the UK had run a system of concentration camps and “enclosed villages” in Kenya in the 1950s into which almost the entire Kikuyu population was driven. Many thousands were tortured and murdered or died of hunger and disease. Almost all the documents recording these great crimes were systematically burned or dumped at sea in weighted crates by the British government, and replaced with fake files. The record of British colonial atrocities in Malaya, Yemen, Aden, Cyprus and the Chagos Islands was similarly purged.  Just as the Kremlin requires a campaign of disinformation to justify its imperial aggression in Ukraine, the British empire also needed a system of comprehensive lies. Not only were our imperial crimes deleted from the record, but an entire ideology – racism – was constructed to justify the killing, looting and enslavement of other people.  At the end of his excellent BBC podcast series about QAnon, The Coming Storm, Gabriel Gatehouse lamented the loss of a “common frame of reference” and a “shared sense of reality”. I agree with him about the danger of conspiracy theories, but we should remember that when we last possessed a common frame of reference and a shared sense of reality, they were built on lies. Almost everyone in Britain believed that the empire was a force for good, and that we had a holy duty – the “white man’s burden” – to either crush or “civilise” those races we labelled “inferior” and “savage”. Almost everyone believed the lies of national heroism, the lies of the crown, the lies of the church and the lies of the social order.  But most of us have emerged from that era, haven’t we? We’re more sceptical, less trusting now. Most of us recognise nonsense when we see it. Really? So how do we account for the fact that almost everyone in public life subscribes to the same set of preposterous beliefs? Let’s set aside the wild conspiracy theories of the far right, even though they’re now starting to infect the mainstream right. Let’s focus on the “acceptable” range of political opinion.  Nearly everyone who appears in the media, across almost the entire political spectrum, seems to accept that economic growth can and should continue indefinitely on a finite planet. Almost all believe that we should take action to protect life on Earth only when it is cost-effective. Even then, we should avoid compromising the profits of legacy industries. They appear to believe that something they call “the economy” takes priority over our life support systems.  They further believe that the unhindered acquisition of enormous wealth by a few people is somehow acceptable. They believe that taxes sufficient to break the cycle of accumulation and redistribute extreme wealth are unthinkable. They believe that permitting a handful of offshore billionaires to own the media, set the political agenda and tell us where our best interests lie is fine. They believe that we should pledge unquestioning allegiance to a system we call capitalism even though they are unable to define it, let alone predict where it might be heading.  No terror or torture is required to persuade people to fall into line with these crazy beliefs. Somehow our system of organised lying has created an entire class of politicians, officials, media commentators, cultural leaders, academics and intellectuals who nod along with them. Reading accounts of 20th-century terror, it sometimes seems to me that there was more dissent among intellectuals confronting totalitarian regimes than there is in our age of freedom and choice.  We have a truth crisis all right. But it is much deeper and wider than we care to admit. Perhaps the biggest lie of all is that the crisis is confined to the Kremlin’s falsehoods and the far right’s conspiracy theories. On the contrary, it is systemic and almost universal.

Seated in second place with 25 points with a comfortable advantage on goal difference, a win, draw or loss by anything fewer than six goals would have been enough to get them over the line. Had lightning struck, the worst-case scenario was an intercontinental playoff with New Zealand in June.  Redemption for 2017’s failed World Cup qualification felt imminent, but focus on the task at hand never waned in camp. “We still have a job to do” was the refrain echoing from head coach Gregg Berhalter to key players Tyler Adams, Tim Weah and Deandre Yedlin throughout the run-up to Tuesday’s Concacaf qualifying finale. And despite the math that weighed heavily in their favor, Berhalter and co on Wednesday put to rest speculation the team would rotate players or be happy with a draw. The task was qualification, but the manner of qualification mattered. The players conveyed a desire to win, to make a point, to leave a mark, to do what every US team before them had failed to do: win a World Cup qualifying match away in Costa Rica.  As for the hosts, the atmosphere was celebratory and hopeful. The 35,062-seat bandbox was packed and cheering. After a remarkable run of five wins and one draw in their final six matches, Los Ticos had elbowed their way into qualifying contention. They entered Wednesday’s match poised to snag the fourth-place playoff spot and, no doubt looking forward strategically toward that match, they sat a number of key players, including Joel Campbell and Bryan Oviedo, to guard against potential yellow card accumulation that would sit them out of that one-off in June.  The United States out-possessed the Costa Ricans ever so slightly during a scoreless first half. They eclipsed them in free kick and corner accrual, winning seven corners but converting none. They looked threatening in places and did good work getting the ball forward, especially from the right side. They held Costa Rica well defensively and were setting the pace of the match.  The opening minutes of the second half saw the United States’ best chance on goal. It felt like the moment the Americans would take the lead, capitalizing on the momentum built in the first half and sending the US on their way to make history in qualifying. Miles Robinson was well positioned in front of net looking threatening, where he received a cross and sent it toward net with a header that felt assured to slot in were it not for an incredible save from Keylor Navas.

Moments later, Costa Rica won a corner on the opposite end of the pitch. Brandon Aguilera took the attempt, sending it to Juan Pablo Vargas who catapulted it past US goalkeeper Zack Steffen, putting Costa Rica ahead in the 51st. In a match that ultimately came down to capitalizing and defending on set pieces, the United States had taken seven corners by then and came away with nothing – and Costa Rica had just converted its third corner into a goal.  The momentum shift on the pitch and in the stands was immediate. Eight minutes later, Anthony Contreras snuck in behind Antonee Robinson to tap in Costa Rica’s second goal off another cross before a delirious crowd.  Still fighting, still hoping, Berhalter sent in three subs immediately. Jesus Ferreira, Giovanni Reyna and Shaq Moore entered, joining Luca de la Torre who had gone in at the half as substitutions. But the USA would never quite regain the momentum or control the pace of the match. They won a handful more corners, but again failed to make anything out of them. They pushed the ball forward and kept on the attack, but were slowed by fouls and tight defending.  The crowd roared behind the home team, sending the momentum their way. The Los Ticos looked goal-dangerous until the last whistle.  The match ended 2-0 in favor of the hosts. Despite the outcome, despite failure to grasp hold of history with their first ever qualifying win in Costa Rica, the United States completed the essential task before them, the one they set out to achieve eight months ago in El Salvador: officially punching their ticket to Qatar 2022.  Canada, who secured their first World Cup trip since 1986 with a win on Sunday, finished top of the group with 28 points after a 1-0 loss at Panama. Mexico won 2-0 against El Salvador to move ahead of the US into second place and clinch their eighth straight World Cup appearance.

That game raised an uncomfortable truth about football, ownership and the way our game is run.”  Back in the day proper football men didn’t talk much about politics and certainly not about uncomfortable truths. Probably, people in football should talk about those things a great deal more, if only because they seem so intent on gatecrashing the main stage. Uncomfortable truths: this is the game now.  Graeme Le Saux spent 11 years at Chelsea in two spells, departing the same summer Roman Abramovich arrived, 2003. He works as a Premier League analyst for NBC and also has a non-executive director role with Real Mallorca, a club owned by the US property billionaire Robert Sarver.  If this gives him a degree of inside track, a locus standi on the current shemozzle around football club ownership, then there are other elements, too. Le Saux has always been engaged and politically nonconformist. These things are relative. In pre-modern football any kind of politics, even the most centrist of Guardian-reading, museum-going engagement with the wider world, seemed pretty radical.  If that quality used to mark Le Saux as an outsider, there are certain advantages in being able to speak with a degree of awareness about the challenges the supercharged game faces, as well as in being prepared to go into the kind of difficult places that make you wish the former left-back was still hanging in there as a face on the Match of the Day sofa.  “Of course Eddie Howe doesn’t want to be asked questions about executions,” he says of that afternoon when Saudi PIF instrument met plaything of a sanctioned Putin associate. “It makes him feel very uncomfortable.  “That’s the dilemma. At what point do you put your principles ahead of who you work for? Everyone has to answer that themselves. If he [Howe] is happy fending off those questions with the answers he gave then people will judge him according to that.  “As a player I felt I had principles, that I tried to use my position to include how I felt about stuff. It’s not as easy as just saying this is abhorrent, is it? Or maybe it is.”  The issue closest to Le Saux’s heart is Chelsea’s ongoing sale, from the treatment of the club at the hands of a government in which he has “no trust whatsoever” to the shadow cast over the intervening 19 years and frustration at English football missing a chance to reset the way its governance works.  “There has been a lot of noise around the sale. People who have put in a bid have had a lot of publicity that I assume is coming from them,” he says. “But do any of us really know what the process is? Is this going to be based on the highest bidder or on the right bidder? Are any of these decisions being based on a set of principles or values?  “Football has a choice on the direction of travel. There is an opportunity to change the model now, where people value the sustainability of a football club over whoever bankrolls it. But we’re going to come out in the same place with the same uncertainties. It’s a massive wasted opportunity.”  For Le Saux, part of the frustration is seeing football being asked to solve problems that are equally present in the power structures around it. “Just look at the relationship between Russian money and politics, if that’s the focus of our attention at the moment. If we go back six weeks, Roman Abramovich owning Chelsea was not a problem for the British government, despite what they already knew. There is clearly an inconsistency around what value and standards we place around certain industries. And it seems football always has to carry the burden.  Graeme Le Saux in action for Chelsea in 1999. Photograph: Graham Whitby-Boot/ Sportsphoto/Sportsphoto Ltd.  “There is a huge lack of trust at the moment. There are real concerns around institutions that are meant to be there to support us. Look at the problems in politics and in things like policing. If there was trust in how our country is run you might not ask these questions. Whereas now we’re all asking whose self-interest is going to be served in this deal?”  With that in mind, does he really think people in football can be expected to take the lead on these moral issues? “Ultimately, it comes down to what sacrifices you’re prepared to make,” Le Saux says. “Will anyone say, ‘I’m not going to play for this club for this reason, it goes against my core principles’? I think some players would. I’m sure the players do care.  “If I was in the Chelsea dressing room the day of the Newcastle game I would have worn a Stop The War T-shirt in support of Ukraine. Everybody had the opportunity and still does to say this is the new era for Chelsea.  “But that is where leadership is important. The bigger question is should football, should the Premier League, should the Football Association put players in the position where they have to make those moral decisions? Should fans have to? We’re all being asked to enforce our own morality.  “That’s why we need leadership and governance to plot a course through those very difficult questions. These principles should be under lock and key in one of those buildings, not at the feet of a football player.”  There is sympathy also for those whose jobs are under threat. “The government felt the need to sanction oligarchs but I don’t think they have the first clue about the impact on fans and on everyone that works at the club, from players to the coaching staff to the backroom employees,” says Le Saux.  “People are very quick to stick the boot in when something goes wrong – that’s part of the ‘banter’ of football. So I’m not surprised some Chelsea fans feel confused by this. It’s not about them being the victim; there are people being shelled, this is not about football fans. But they have woken up from one day to the next with the club they have supported for however many years in complete turmoil.  Graeme Le Saux after a Real Mallorca victory in 2019. Photograph: Reuters/Alamy  “How do they get back that pride, that connection with the club? It’s a massive part of this takeover. We can’t let the situation drag on in this weird limbo. At the same time it would be a disaster if we rushed through a bid without considering the opportunities and the longer-term plan.”  The longer-term plan: this is always the tough bit. Le Saux is pretty radical on the idea of structural, even philosophical change. “The big change for me is trying to address the pure dominance of money. That creates so many other problems. It creates inflation. It creates the imbalance that has been clear for some time.  “Look at Chelsea. Roman invested £1.5bn of his own money for the club to be so dominant. You think, if that’s what is required then is that how we really want the game to exist? The amounts are just jaw-dropping.  “We have allowed every decision to be based on money. No one should be surprised at the talk of a super league because the big clubs always need more fuel in the top of the tank. Can we reset that? Rather than Chelsea going to the highest bidder do we try to add an idea of integrity into the mix? Once the valuation on the club is met can the government or the regulator say it’s time to look at sustainability and fan engagement and building on a different model?  “There has to be a willingness in football to see change, to show some restraint. Salary caps are difficult because then you say, well, money goes underground. But that shouldn’t stop you from trying to regulate and find a balance.  “I work with Mallorca and financial fair play has stopped us from investing, because even if the owners wanted to invest in reasonable things the salary cap is so small that we have to ensure that money goes on getting the first team to a competitive level. FFP punishes the smaller clubs and benefits the bigger clubs.”  For now, Le Saux will be glued to the denouement to the season, albeit with some reservations over what the next few months may bring for his former club. Thomas Tuchel has been the peg holding the playing side together. How long can he be expected to hang in there?  “Tuchel has been great for the Premier League, he’s fascinating when he talks about tactics, he has that high emotional intelligence,” says Le Saux. “But he will be as shocked and unsettled as everyone else. And people aren’t going to say: ‘Let’s give Chelsea some time and let them sort themselves out.’ They’re going to say: ‘Who can we get now because they’re all going to be at a discount?’  “One of the biggest issues facing Chelsea is cash flow. Can they get enough in to keep paying everyone? It just feels like an absolute mess.”

Emma Graham-Harrison reports from Kharkiv  In the past few days, Russia has said its war on Ukraine has entered a “new phase” and plans to refocus on the east of the country. At peace talks in Istanbul, Russia said it would significantly reduce its military activity in northern Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv.  If this announcement is to be believed, it would signal a new stage of this war. Guardian reporter Emma Graham-Harrison travelled to Kharkiv, one of the country’s most war-torn cities in eastern Ukraine, with reporter Isobel Koshiw to understand what this new chapter might mean for Ukrainians there. She tells Michael Safi about the Ukrainians there who are resisting the Russian attack in surprising ways.  But is the new plan Russia announced really what it seems? After the peace talks, the Ukrainian military released an intelligence report expressing its doubts about Russia’s intentions. The report stated “the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. On the Russian announcement, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said “Ukrainians are not naive people.”

For its government, it is also an opportunity to score some points in Brussels.  Poland has “never had such an excellent brand, all over the world”, its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, declared last week. It is “in the right position in international politics”, he said, no longer behind a “wall of unfair isolation”. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to visit the country on Friday.  Mired in a bitter seven-year standoff with the EU over democratic backsliding and the rule of law, the government in Warsaw – whose populist brand of national-conservatism has also strained relations with Washington – now hopes the fallout from Vladimir Putin’s war will finally oblige the bloc to cut it some slack.  In particular, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, whose popularity is on the rise again after sliding for 18 months, wants Brussels to unlock €36bn (£30bn) in pandemic recovery funds blocked over concerns about whether Warsaw can guarantee it will spend EU money properly because of its politicised judiciary.  But while the Polish government is clearly seeking to capitalise on the country’s newfound good-guy status – and may well win some short-term favour – Warsaw’s longer-term conflict with the EU is unlikely to disappear, analysts say.  “PiS may be saying: ‘Look, there’s a real dictator out there, waging a real war – that’s all that matters and that’s what we should all be concentrating on right now,’” said Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex.  “But at some stage there will be a negotiated peace, or the war will sink into one of attrition and fall out of the spotlight. More normal patterns will resume. And the underlying causes of Poland’s rule-of-law dispute with the EU are not going away.”  Scarred by centuries of Russian aggression and occupation culminating in nearly half a century of communist dictatorship, Poland has long warned the EU of the threat from Moscow, especially since the time of Putin’s 2014 invasion of Crimea.  The nationalist PiS-led government’s constant recent rowing with Brussels, its culture-war attacks on LGBTQ+ people and abortion rights and its bridge-building with anti-EU, pro-Putin figures such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen may have slightly muddied the picture.  But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was nonetheless a historic “we told you so” moment for Poland, said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS University in Warsaw. It meant Warsaw could try to position itself as “the capital that had been warning this would happen” for years.  As Putin’s aggression shifted the EU’s centre of gravity eastward, the crisis “creates an opportunity for Poland to stake a claim to being a regional leader”, Stanley said. “It’s determined to show itself as taking the lead in persuading a reluctant west to take tougher action; stiffening resolve in a very public way.”  Morawiecki’s visit to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the invasion was seen by many as instrumental in Germany’s about-turn on arms shipments, defence spending, and financial sanctions. The visit by Morawiecki and the PiS leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, this month to embattled Kyiv “on behalf of the EU”, alongside the Czech and Slovenian prime ministers, underscored the strategy.  Poland has also been tougher than any other EU member state on sanctions in calling for a total embargo on all trade with Russia. It also proposed a Nato peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and stepped up to become the main transit point for western shipments of arms, munitions and military equipment to Ukraine.  The country’s immense humanitarian effort – albeit widely acknowledged as more due to the extraordinary generosity and mobilisation of civil society than to central government – in taking in more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees is also being touted by some politicians as grounds for EU leniency.  A recent poll for Oko.press showed 66% of Poles wanted the government to accept EU rule of law rules and end its dispute with Brussels – including nearly one in three PiS voters. But 56% also said the funds should now be released without conditions, bolstering a potential PiS narrative that Poland should get the money with no strings attached because it has welcomed so many refugees.  “There’s a strategy to emotionally blackmail the EU into taking a softer line,” said Stanley. “An attempt to refashion the discourse, to say: ‘We’re trying to deal with real problems; you’re just hindering us with all this rule-of-law stuff.’”  Szczerbiak said PiS had long pursued a twin-track strategy towards the EU of accepting inevitable conflict over rule-of-law and culture-war issues, while at the same time insisting Poland was being a “positive, constructive EU member” on the subjects that really matter.  “In a sense, the war has actually reinforced that discourse,” he said. “It means Warsaw can say: ‘OK, so there’s a lot we disagree on. But on the really important stuff, look what good Europeans we are.’ It means there’s now huge pressure on both sides to de-escalate.”  Some in Brussels believe Poland, which has put the cost of welcoming refugees from Ukraine at €2.2bn this year alone, could ask for special compensation, perhaps similar to the deal the EU struck with Turkey after the 2015 refugee crisis.  But EU officials also say the Polish government now has a bigger opportunity to close long-festering disputes with Brussels over the rule of law which have led to €1m daily fines and the freezing of the country’s pandemic recovery fund.  Warsaw’s plan for the fund could be approved within weeks, EU officials say, if Poland moves ahead with a promise to abolish the disciplinary tribunal of the supreme court, a system of political control that violates EU law.  Danuta Hübner, an MEP for the centre-right opposition Civic Platform party and former EU commissioner, said she was proud of Polish civil society’s refugee effort but accused the government of being “entirely absent”.  She said Poland needed the recovery funds “as quickly as possible” but still had a long way to go to unlock them. Abuse of the rule of law was “ongoing”, she said, adding that the commission should approve the plan only if Poland’s supreme court was properly reformed.  Robert Biedroń, a centre-left opposition MEP, said it would be outrageous if the commission defied “the mainstream and the will of the citizens of the county”, as well as the European parliament, by not sticking to conditions to release the funds.  He said he would “fight very hard” for EU funds for refugee support, but warned against releasing other EU money without ensuring Warsaw rolls back recent changes to the court system that undermine judicial independence. “The rule of law cannot be another victim of this war,” he said. “How would we explain the difference between us and Putin if we don’t respect the rule of law?”  Ultimately, said Andrzej Bobińnski and Wojciech Szacki of the Polityka Insight thinktank, the war could be “a cathartic moment” for Poland’s political class – but it was still “too early to tell if this means a U-turn for Poland back toward the liberal west”.  Some PiS politicians may want peace with Brussels, they argued, others insist the war shows precisely how “the west was wrong, how it needs Poland, and how Poland now has the upper hand in security, humanitarian, and European issues”.  PiS would certainly not hesitate to exploit any EU reluctance to pay up, Stanley said – especially once the enormous future cost of housing, educating and employing 2 million refugees becomes a political reality.

During negotiations in Geneva for a Paris-style agreement on nature, which ended this week, the use of genetic data in a digital form – known as digital sequence information (DSI) – arose as a clear point of division, with African countries insisting any deal must include a financial mechanism to compensate them for discoveries using digital forms of their biodiversity.  With echoes of tensions in climate talks over the failure of developed countries to meet the $100bn-a-year climate finance target at Cop26 in Glasgow, a large group of developing countries, including Brazil, India and Gabon, also called on rich nations to pledge more than $100bn (£75bn) a year of biodiversity finance from public and private sources at the Cop15 summit in Kunming this year, reaching $700bn by 2030.  Q&A What is the Kunming biodiversity conference? Show At Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in October 2020 but after several delays it is hoped that a face-to-face meeting will happen in 2022. Why is it a big deal?  Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?  No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term threat, to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises. What might the Kunming agreement look like?  In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  The disagreement came after a slow fortnight of negotiations in Switzerland, which, despite progress in some areas, left the ambition of the overall agreement in the balance. Leading conservation organisations said talks had moved at a “snail’s pace” and further negotiations have been scheduled for the end of June in Nairobi to prepare for Cop15 in China.  From creating Covid vaccines to manufacturing drink sweeteners, the genetic sequences of plants, animals and other organisms in digital form have revolutionised biotechnology and life sciences research, leading to new HIV therapies, genetically modified crops and innovations in conservation.

It is hoped that similar techniques will lead to new cancer drugs and other innovations in a variety of sectors.  But during this week’s talks, countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean warned that DSI has become a loophole for pharmaceutical companies and others to avoid sharing profits deriving from their flora, fauna and other forms of life – what has become known as biopiracy.  Sharing the benefits from genetic resources is one of the three objectives of the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD), through which governments are negotiating a Paris-style agreement for nature known as the global biodiversity framework, with draft targets to protect 30% of land and sea, reduce agricultural pollution and environmentally harmful subsidies.  Pierre du Plessis, a Namibian negotiator speaking for Africa, said that without a deal on DSI he would not allow the adoption of the entire agreement, warning that Cop15 in Kunming could become a “Copenhagen moment” for biodiversity, in a reference to when 2009 climate talks in the Danish capital collapsed.  “From an African point of view, we will not accept the adoption of the global biodiversity framework [without agreement on DSI]. It’s just an outcome too horrible to contemplate but if that’s what we need to do then that’s what we will do,” Du Plessis said.  Africa has proposed a 1% biodiversity levy on the retail price of all products based on genetic resources and DSI, with proceeds going to biodiversity conservation around the world. The idea is likely to face significant opposition from the EU, Canada and other rich countries.

Photograph: Dolores Ochoa/AP  An agreement on the procedures to follow when asking to use genetic information, known as the Nagoya protocol, is already in place after concerns that companies were commercialising indigenous knowledge and genetic resources for nothing. But not all countries have ratified the agreement and they are allowed to make their own rules, which has meant DSI has become a grey area.  At the closing plenary session on Tuesday, countries signed off an agreement including further negotiations on DSI, which Du Plessis welcomed, but said there was a long way to go, amid fears that scientific and commercial research could get entangled in red tape if the issue is not resolved.  Leonardo de Athayde, head of Brazil’s negotiating team, said DSI was an important issue for his country that should be included in the final text.  “We’re open to considering different options as long as it generates money and provides an incentive also for sustainable use of biodiversity,” he said.  Other states warned that without an agreement in Kunming, access to biodiversity in their country for scientific and commercial research would face increased bureaucracy.  Dr Amber Hartman Scholz, a researcher from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ and a leading expert on DSI, said whatever was agreed in China must be simple while also maintaining free and open access for scientific research around the world. Currently, DSI is held on three main databases in Japan, Europe and the US.  “The changes that molecular biological data is going to make to our lives in the coming decades – cancer drugs, personalised medicine, everything where nature interacts with man – that’s all based upon sequence data. It’s going to blow our minds in the next 100 years,” she said.  “Sharing benefits from DSI is just, but paralysing science with red tape is not,” said Hartman Scholz. “We have to get this right.”  Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said DSI highlighted “some of the deepest ideological differences between CBD parties”.  “It is a scientifically and legally complex issue and is tightly connected to finance. With limited progress in Geneva, there are already too many bombs for Kunming to remove. DSI is certainly one of the thorniest that will detonate a chain of explosions if not managed carefully,” he said.

The Met Office said it was increasing heatwave temperature thresholds in eight counties before the summer. The change reflected “an undeniable warming trend” for the UK that had made the original thresholds obsolete.  For hot weather to be officially considered a heatwave, the temperature in a specific area has to reach a threshold set by the Met Office for three consecutive days. This varies by UK county.  Quick Guide How global heating is causing more extreme weather Show Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system. Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding. Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California. Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but human impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  In Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, the temperature now has to linger at 28C for three days or more to be officially classed as a heatwave, up from 27C previously.  In Lincolnshire, temperatures must reach 27C, an increase from 26C, and in East Riding of Yorkshire it has changed to 26C, from 25C.  Dr Mark McCarthy, who manages UK climate records at the Met Office, said statistics showed the UK was getting warmer. The rise was greatest in parts of central and eastern England, where temperatures in some locations had increased by more than 1C. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the rise was closer to 0.7C.  The Met Office said its definitions were always intended to be flexible and to adapt to a changing climate. The original heatwave thresholds were based on the climate between 1981 and 2010. The new thresholds are based on the climate from 1991-2020.  Climate change was also making heatwaves more likely, McCarthy said.  “A scientific study by the Met Office into the summer 2018 heatwave in the UK showed that it was 30 times more likely to occur now than in 1750 because of the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” he said.  “As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, heatwaves of similar intensity are projected to become even more frequent, perhaps occurring as regularly as every other year.”  The 2018 heatwave caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans, crop failures, and a number of wildfires in the UK. Nearly 700 more deaths than average were recorded during the heatwave’s 15-day peak.

Vigilance and responsibility,” the country’s far-right leader, Naftali Bennett, said in a video statement on Wednesday evening. “Whoever has a gun licence, this is the time to carry it.”  Bennett, who spoke from his home where he is in quarantine after testing positive for Covid, had earlier said the country was facing a “new wave of terror”.  The back-to-back attacks have left Israelis and Palestinians bracing for further violence.  The defence minister, Benny Gantz, announced he had ordered 1,000 soldiers to bolster police forces, and Israel’s military presence in the Palestinian territories it occupies has been reinforced.  The bloodshed comes at a dangerous time. Next month, a rare convergence of Ramadan for Muslims, Passover for Jews and Easter for Christians is expected to raise tensions, with people off work and in the streets. Israel tightly controls access to Jerusalem’s holy sites for all three religions, which has previously led to confrontations.  Those holidays also precede a series of delicate anniversaries in the coming weeks. Some, such as Israeli independence day and the Palestinian Nakba commemoration of their expulsion, are decades old. Others are fresher, such as the one-year anniversary of the 11-day May conflict that killed more than 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel.  In the aftermath of Tuesday’s shooting rampage in Bnei Brak on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, one car’s white leather seats had been stained with blood, as were the front tiles of a nearby grocery shop, near multipacks of Coca-Cola bottles and a crisp packet stand.  The victims were a diverse mix – two Jewish ultra-Orthodox residents, Yaakov Shalom, 36, and Avishai Yehezkel, 29; two unnamed Ukrainians living in Israel as construction workers; and Amir Khoury, 32, a Christian Arab police officer who had engaged in a firefight with the attacker.  Police identified the perpetrator as Diaa Armashah, 27, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank. He had arrived in Bnei Brak with an M-16 assault rifle and opened fire on cars, cyclists and balconies.  Amateur video footage showed a man wearing black walking into a street with a long gun as people ran away.  At one of the funerals on Wednesday, Ovadia Yehezkel said his brother, Avishai, had used his body to shield his two-year-old son in a stroller. “You cared for your son; you did not give up,” Ovadia said in a eulogy, according to the Times of Israel news outlet.  Israeli forces operating in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday arrested five Palestinians allegedly involved. The Palestinian Prisoner’s Club, a group that represents current and former Palestinian prisoners, said those arrested were Amarshah’s relatives.  Bnei Brak’s bloodshed brought the total death toll in Israel in recent days to 11, the highest number of people killed by militants in such a short period outside wartime in several years.  Last week, an attack in the southern city of Beersheba, in which four people were killed in a stabbing and car-ramming rampage, was carried out by an Arab citizen of Israel.  On Sunday, an Arab assailant, a resident of a town in the north of the country, shot and killed two police officers in Hadera, a city north of Tel Aviv, before he was gunned down by other officers.  Both those attacks were claimed by Islamic State, an organisation that is not known to have a large presence inside the country but which Israeli and Palestinian authorities fear could wield increased influence.  Amos Harel, a military and defence correspondent for Haaretz newspaper, said Tuesday’s attack – which he said may have been a “copycat” attack by a sympathiser inspired by last week’s attacks – was “Israel’s worst fear come true”.  “On three separate occasions, terrorists managed to reach the heart of cities inside Israel and carry out campaigns of slaughter unhindered,” he wrote. “None of the attacks were preceded by intelligence warnings. For now, the terrorists seem to be one step ahead of the security services, which still seem to be groping in the dark. Israelis’ sense of personal security has suffered a serious blow.”  He added: “In the coming days, we will likely see more stormy demonstrations, calls for vengeance and perhaps attacks on Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. Similar things happened last May during the Hamas-Israel war in the Gaza Strip.”  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, issued a condemnation of the Tuesday night attack. “The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation, while we are all striving for stability,” Abbas said in a statement.  On Wednesday, Jordan’s King Abdullah II also condemned “violence in all its forms” in a meeting with visiting the Israeli president Isaac Herzog.  Earlier this week, Israel hosted a summit of Arab foreign ministers from Morocco, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain in the Negev desert. Israel’s budding ties with former Arab foes, while continuing to control the lives of several million Palestinians living under occupation, have led to a sense of desperation and anger among Palestinians.

One UN official admitted he feared the Taliban’s increasingly repressive rule would lead to a donor backlash.  The new UN appeal, on top of the flash appeal for $600m in the immediate wake of the Taliban takeover in August, is hoping to raise the biggest sum ever for a single country at a pledging conference.  But the decision by the Taliban on 23 March to renege on a pledge to let girls above grade 6 return to education, leading to street protests, is likely to put many donors off.  The World Bank has put four projects in Afghanistan worth $600m from its reworked Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund on hold until the position is clarified. Plans to pay teachers’ salaries through the fund are being reviewed, at least in the schools where older children are banned.  The UN estimates that about 10 million children across Afghanistan urgently need humanitarian assistance to survive.  The UK announced on Wednesday it was providing £286m this financial year, the same as last year, promising none of the money would go to reward the Taliban.  The sum was criticised by the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said the UK traditionally would have offered £325m, or 10% of the target. The UK is co-hosting the pledging event along with Germany, Qatar and the UN. Preparations for the event have been relatively brief, and a Yemen pledging event fell short.  Western aid formed 75% of the Afghan government budget before the Taliban took over.  It had been hoped the UN’s pledging conference would take place against an optimistic backdrop of older children having just started the new school year for the first time since the Taliban seized power, making international recognition of the Taliban a realistic objective.  Repeated assurances that older girls would be able to attend had been given to western officials, and Unicef agencies, right up to the start of the new school year, by those Taliban leaders that favour normalisation. But western officials now say they think their interlocutors were trying to ease through the reform in a low-key way, establishing facts on the ground, without the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, being fully consulted.  Since then a raft of other repressive measures have been imposed over the transmission of western media, such as the BBC, as well as new requirements for men to wear beards if working in offices. Women have also been banned from travelling by air independently. Taliban determination to be able to direct or to tax humanitarian aid is also said to be rising.  Achim Steiner, the head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in Kabul this week warned further delays in starting classes not only harmed the girls’ futures, but risked Afghanistan being ignored.  “For us and the United Nations, this is a critical moment in which the world needs to understand Afghanistan,” he told reporters on Monday.  “But the leadership of Afghanistan must also recognise that the world can very easily turn to other crises.”  If there were any “technical constraints” in reopening the schools the UN would make it a top priority to resolve them, Steiner said.  “But if it were to signal a more fundamental reversal on this principle, it would indeed create I think a crisis in the way that both the international community and the country could relate to one another,” he said.  With the west’s influence hitting a roadblock, China looks to be jumping in. Yue Xiaoyong, China’s special envoy for Afghan affairs, will host a two-day meeting starting on Wednesday in Tunxi, in eastern China’s Anhui province, of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s six neighbouring countries.  The acting foreign minister of the Afghan interim government, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is due to attend, as well as the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, made a surprise visit to Kabul last week and stressed China “respects the religious beliefs and national customs of Afghanistan”, and “never interfered in Afghanistan’s internal affairs”.  The UN security council, through a resolution last year backed up by as many as seven US Treasury statements, has had some success in reassuring donors and aid agencies that it is possible to operate in the country without risk of US sanctions, but banks and finance houses remain nervous.  Diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, much more possible if the education for secondary-age girls had been allowed, now remains off the table, leaving the cloud of uncertainty about whether aid activity becomes sanctionable. The UN is still required to fund some of its activities by sending large suitcases of cash into Kabul.  A World Bank fund for Afghanistan has released £1.2bn for development work, and the Asian Development Bank has a $405m fund.

Days before what will be a closely-fought general election against a unified opposition bloc, Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz administration – which has previously trumpeted its hostility to those it considers illegal migrants – claimed it had accepted more refugees fleeing Ukraine than any other neighbouring country after taking Hungary’s population of 9.6 million into account.  Zoltan Kovacs, the government’s international spokesperson, said Hungary had welcomed more than 540,000 people escaping the conflict, a figure he said amounted to between five and six refugees for every 100 Hungarian inhabitants.  However, the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO dedicated to helping refugees, called the statistics “misleading” and said most of those arriving subsequently travelled on to other countries. The number of refugees in Hungary was much lower than the official figures, the committee insisted.  It also said the Hungarian government had failed to take adequate steps to inform those who had chosen to remain of their right to official protection, and added that Hungarian communication efforts paled beside neighbouring Poland and Slovakia, which has provided online forms to apply for protection.  Despite the massive exodus from Ukraine, as of 27 March, according to official figures, only 7,749 people had applied for temporary protected status in Hungary entitling them to social welfare support including housing, the right to work and access to education, as required by an EU decision on how those fleeing the Russian invasion should be treated across the bloc.  Márta Pardavi, the Helsinki committee’s co-chair, said the relatively low number of applicants showed many refugees were merely passing through Hungary, while others were having trouble obtaining information about their entitlements.  “How many people entered at the border does not mean anything about how many are staying longer than the time it takes to transit Hungary,” she said. “In reality, there are far less Ukrainian refugees staying in Hungary.  “In its quest for additional funds from the EU, the Hungarian government uses the most impressive number it can find. However, it has to provide for a far less number in reality since a high number of Ukrainian refugees move on to other countries.  “It’s as if you count the number of people who go into a clothes store and then you tell the company owner that this is the number of your customers – but there’s a big gap between the number who walk in and the people who actually buy things. Actually getting protected status is not made easy, you have to queue up at the immigration office and no one has received it yet.”  Orban – who has declared that “all those fleeing from Ukraine will find a friend in the Hungarian state” – wrote to the European Commission on 18 March requesting funding from its recovery and resilience facility to help deal with the refugee inflow, which at that point he put at 450,000.  No decision has been made on the application.  Orban’s government has been in prolonged dispute with the EU over the suspension of funding as punishment for infringements against EU rule of law procedures, with Brussels having already frozen €7bn (£5.9bn) in Covid relief funds for Hungary.  Speaking to the Guardian in his office near the Hungarian parliament, Kovacs said he did not know how many refugees were in the country. “Many of them have biometric passports, which means they have visa-free movement within the European Union,” he said. “We can only have a relationship with those who apply for refugee status or asylum.”  In addition to those seeking protected status, another 80,000 had applied for 30-day temporary residency permits, he said.  Asked to explain the gap between those figures and the much higher number of arrivals, he said: “Many of those who have come from Ukraine are coming with the knowledge that they have relatives, friends, all over Europe and they try to spend some time with them until the war is over.  “The Hungarian state is doing everything according to what we have agreed with the united European opinion.”  Pardavi said some of those still in Hungary were staying in hotels at their own expense. Many had not applied for EU protected status because they were not aware of it, while those who had made applications have to wait up to 45 days for the process to be completed. In the meantime, welfare is being provided by charities and NGOs, she said.  In the Czech Republic – which, unlike Hungary, already had a large prewar Ukrainian expatriate community but no border with Ukraine – authorities have issued more 242,000 temporary visas to refugees and estimate the total number inside the country at 300,000, far below the Hungarian entry figures. More than 240,000 have already registered for Czech state health insurance. The Czech Republic is also seeking European funding to help deal with the crisis.  Poland has had £30bn in EU pandemic recovery funding frozen in a long-running dispute over rule of law breaches. But the country’s differences with Brussels have begun to fade into the background as its humanitarian effort to help refugees and expressions of solidarity with Ukraine have earned it plaudits. Poland has so far received more than 2 million people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and the Polish government has said it will spend €2.2bn this year alone to support them. Warsaw is pressing for the pandemic funding to be released, plus other sources of EU compensation.

But are they really? Do you have a God-given right to believe that torture is good, or that the moon landings were faked? To the extent that opinions are not merely secret possessions but dispositions to act a certain way in society, they are everyone’s business. So, no, you don’t have an inalienable right to your dumb opinion.  Unfortunately, that was also the position of the Spanish Inquisition and witch-hunters, who dreamed up vicious ways of attempting to uncover inner impiety. So these days we generally separate opinions (or beliefs) from the expression of them. Expression can be regulated, in the case of incitement to hatred, for example, but opinion is sacrosanct. It’s a fundamental freedom, but one that is everywhere under attack.  Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.  So begins human rights lawyer Susie Alegre’s fascinating book, which sketches a brief history of legal freedoms from the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi onwards, and explains the conceptual struggles behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights announced in 1948. That text defends rights to freedom of both “thought” and “opinion”: some delegates understood “thought” to mean religious belief, while others considered it superfluous as an addition to “opinion”; it was the Soviets who insisted it remain, “out of respect for the heroes and martyrs of science”.  But if “opinion” was merely a private, internal affair, why did its freedom need protecting at all? This was, Alegre explains, at the behest of the British, who “insisted that ‘in totalitarian countries, opinions were definitely controlled by careful restriction of the sources of information’, stressing that interference could happen even before an opinion was formed”. The Brits, having had a Propaganda Bureau and then a Ministry of Information, as well as birthing a certain George Orwell, knew what they were talking about.  If propaganda undermines the right to freedom of opinion, however, then we are all in trouble. And this is one of the main arguments that Alegre pursues. The modern online environment, polluted as it is by fake news, violates our freedom to form reliable thoughts. On this view, the people who stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, in the apparently sincere belief that the presidential election had been stolen by Joe Biden, were victims; and so are the millions of ordinary Russians who believe what the state-controlled media is telling them about the so-called special operation in Ukraine.  When my daughter asked why she couldn’t have an Alexa, I told her it is because Alexa steals your dreams and sells them Susie Alegre  The online world, Alegre argues, harms our freedoms in many other ways, and is of a piece with the cruel history she sketches of phrenology, lobotomies and CIA mind-control experiments. It was recently reported that Nadine Dorries, the UK minister for culture wars, stormed into a meeting with Microsoft and demanded to know when they were going to get rid of “algorithms”: not really possible for a software company, since all computer programs are made of algorithms, but the story does reflect an increasing public suspicion of the ways machines are being used to manipulate us.  Researchers in facial-recognition AI systems, for example, claim to be able to read political affiliation from a photograph; social-media companies analyse posts for indicators of personality traits; fitness trackers are attempting to move into mood-tracking; and fancy new brain-scanning “lie detectors” have been used by prosecutors in Indian courts, arguably infringing the right to avoid self-incrimination. Even if the claims for such technologies are so far overblown, they all represent novel attempts to intrude into what used to be a private mental space.  Here Alegre adroitly cites Nineteen Eighty-Four and its discussion of the lesser-discussed sibling of thoughtcrime, which Orwell called “facecrime”: “It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in a public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide.”  From facecrime to Facebook, and Orwell’s “prolefeed” (“the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses”) to the Twitter feed, is a worryingly short distance. It’s amusing that liking a Facebook page called “Being Confused After Waking Up From Naps” is a strong predictor of male heterosexuality, but it’s grimmer to learn that a leaked Facebook document boasted it was able to target “moments when young people need a confidence boost” on behalf of advertisers. Any and all information we feed into the social-media maw, Alegre notes, “will be analysed to reveal psychological traits or fleeting states of mind that will, in turn, be used to manipulate our behaviour or to tell others how they should treat us”. This is particularly egregious in the realm of behaviour-tracking targeted at children.  Whenever you hear tech companies paying lip-service to “ethics”, Alegre warns, you should be suspicious. “You don’t need to be much of a cynic to see why ethical guidelines may be more palatable to big tech than actual regulation. Ethics are optional.” Legal remedies, then, are required. The headline remedy she suggests is quite thrillingly radical: an outright ban on “surveillance advertising” – the kind dependent on trackers and cookies, that beams out your personal data to hundreds of companies whenever you load a webpage. We never asked for it, and we don’t like it. Just make it illegal, along with other key parts of the digital panopticon, such as “emotion analysis” tech in public places, or Amazon’s voice-activated Alexa devices. “When my daughter asked why she couldn’t have an Alexa like her friends,” Alegre relates heroically, “I told her that it is because Alexa steals your dreams and sells them.”  We have all sleepwalked into this gloomy fairytale, and it’s time to wake up. There remain questions, though, about how far regulation can or should go, since it seems impossible to police all the manifold threats to our cognitive autonomy that Alegre identifies. Some, indeed, are hardly peculiar to the digital age at all. “If inferences can be drawn about your inner world based on your appearance,” she writes, “it does not matter what you actually think or feel. Your freedom to be who you are is curtailed by society’s judgment of you.” Maybe so, but this is lamentably inevitable if you want to live in society at all.  If it should be impermissible, meanwhile, for “governments, companies or people” to seek to “manipulate our opinions”, on the grounds that this violates our right to freedom of thought, one wonders what kind of persuasive speech would still be allowed in such a brave new world. Aren’t arguments of all kinds – political, scientific, artistic – attempts to manipulate the opinions of others? How do we sort the good kind of manipulation from the bad? A benevolent philosopher-king would no doubt figure this out for us, but in the regrettable absence of one it doesn’t seem likely that many people would want to leave it up to a legal authority, whether or not it’s called a Ministry of Truth.

As an opening scene for our stay at The Farm at Avebury, this set the tone – our children taking great delight each day in trying to “say hello” to the darting partridges as they zigzagged through the grounds.  This working farm is set within gently rolling green mounds at the foot of the mysterious Silbury Hill, and we have wellies at the ready during our short break here. They rear Hereford and Angus cattle, rugged sheep, and the newest residents: a litter of Oxford Sandy and Black piglets.  We are staying in one of six newly converted stables. They are clustered around a landscaped courtyard with bronzed planters and borders crafted out of Dutch corten steel, enveloping colourful bursts of cosmos, verbena and “Purrsian Blue” catmint. Eight thousand bulbs planted in and among these planters will see a riot of snowdrops, muscari and anemones giving way to daffodils, fritillaria and alliums. This courtyard becomes the focus of endless hours of play, as Seb, eight, and Jemima whiz around at breakneck speed on bicycles and scooters (provided by the farm) as we watch from the safety of the picture window inside Long Barrow – our retreat for the next few days.  Long Barrow. The Farm at Avebury in the heart of Wiltshire Photograph: PR  There is a well-thought-out welcome pack, including sourdough bread, butter, milk, eggs and juice, all sourced locally. The interior is compact but cosy, with a vaulted ceiling; there are two bedrooms, both with en suites, and one is situated on an open mezzanine floor accessed via a built-in wooden ladder. Original artwork sits alongside contemporary pieces, and the colour scheme is muted and calming, with flourishes of blush pink. For those in need of extra provisions there is the option to order from the farm, or there are shops and pubs aplenty in nearby Avebury.  This working farm is set within rolling green mounds at the foot of mysterious Silbury Hill  Shortly after we settle in, the children are whisked off by Jamie King from the outdoor adventure company Mud and Guts. King, who bills himself as the pied piper of the natural surroundings in Wiltshire, gets children to explore the nooks and crannies of local forests, farms and mounds. That night the conversation during dinner is animated. King has led Seb and Jemima around the estate and they have been building dens, lighting fires, whittling wood and learning about the geology of the local, ancient stones. Weeks later we are still finding bits of flint in coat pockets and bedroom drawers.  While the children are off embracing nature, we are treated to a yoga session with Maura Barber-Oosterhuis, who holds regular sessions in the barn – a beautiful, calming space available for hire, and for now our very own private sanctuary. As we stretch and bend and offer our salutations to the sun, our exhaustion at being full-time working parents begins to drift away.  The Farm at Avebury, or Galteemore Farm as it has been known since the 1890s, has been worked by the same family, the Hues, since 1922. Its newest custodians are Rob and Alice, both 38. They are the fourth generation to take it on and have reimagined it for the future of their three daughters.  The Farm at Avebury, in Wiltshire  Farming has undergone the biggest change in a generation, explains Rob, with the devastating impact of the pandemic, the removal of subsidies, the fallout from Brexit and the focus on climate crisis. Though the last is a positive and much-needed step, Rob says it has required farmers across the country to radically alter how they live and work in order to survive.  Hopefully the income we will lose from EU subsidies will be replaced by the income we now get from self-catering Rob Hues  Brexit means the UK has left the EU’s common agricultural policy, under which farmers received about £3.5bn a year in payments based on the amount of land they farmed. In future, there will be payments of “public money for public goods” – that is, farmers taking measures to restore nature, nurture the soil, improve air and water quality, and provide habitats for wildlife, in return for taxpayer-funded support under a system of Environmental Land Management schemes, or ELMs.  “So we had to do something to protect ourselves for the future, and hopefully the income that we will lose from subsidies will be replaced by the income we will now get from the self-catering business. It’s the same for most farmers: if we want to carry on farming, we also have to do something else,” Rob says.  Nazia Parveen and family at nearby Stonehenge. Photograph: Nazia Parveen  And with a quarter of a million tourists passing through historic Avebury – with its Unesco World Heritage stone circle site – every year, combined with a shortfall of accommodation in the area, it feels like Rob is hitting the right notes.  Wiltshire isn’t somewhere we had visited before, or even really considered (sincerest apologies to all “Moonrakers”), but it is the perfect getaway for a family with children, having so many fascinating sites in the vicinity to bring primary-school history lessons alive. There are visits to Stonehenge (a definite bucket list moment for me), but possibly the more interesting monument, and within walking distance of the farm, is the Avebury stone circle, a prehistoric wonder of epic proportions – and one where the children can actually pause, study and ask questions, without the tourist circus of its more famous cousin 30 minutes’ drive away.  Time on the farm in between the sightseeing was restorative. With what seems like the entire UK family holidaying population crammed into every square metre of Devon and Cornwall, give the farm, Avebury and Wiltshire a look instead.  A two-night stay costs £198 for a one-bedroom stable. The trip was provided by The Farm at Avebury

That shift was monumental and seemingly implausible, until it happened. But people soon adapted to saying “sorry, you’re on mute” on Zoom calls and wearing sweatpants all day.  This spring, workers are finally heading back to the office en masse and into another untested and ambitious experiment in work life: hybrid working.  “This is a brave new world – we’re doing something we’ve never done before, which is we’re going to go, en masse, hybrid,” said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford.  Many companies that are bringing their workers back to the office are doing so on this basis, meaning they are allowing employees to do a mix of in-person and virtual work during the week. Some workers will be expected to work a set number of days in the office; others will get to choose which days they want to come in.  The great experiment is already under way. During the week of 9 March, the average office occupancy rate across 10 large US metro areas was 40.5% – the highest percentage since December, according to Kastle Systems.  Companies that once told employees that they would be working from home indefinitely have set dates to return to the office. Microsoft was the first big tech company to announce that it wanted its employees back in the office, by the end of February. Other companies, including Google and Apple, soon followed suit. Twitter, which at the beginning of the pandemic told employees they could work from home “for ever”, said it would reopen its offices in mid-March.  But these companies are telling staff that the era of the five-day office week is over. Some of employees’ time can be spent working from home.  Whether this new structure of office work will last is unclear, largely because this is the first wide-scale adoption of hybrid work.  Bloom, who has studied remote work for nearly two decades, has been consulting with hundreds of companies and managers on their return to office plans. Managers, it seems, want their workers back in the office. A survey from Slack found that executives were three times more likely than non-executive employees to want to return to the office full-time.  Surveys show that people have liked working from home so much that many are willing to switch jobs to keep that option  Employees, on the other hand, want to keep working remotely – at least some of the work week. With today’s tight labor market, Bloom said, the worst thing a company can do is expect workers to come in five days a week. Multiple surveys have shown that workers have liked the perks of working from home so much that many are willing to switch jobs to keep that option.  “That is the fastest way to destroy your company,” Bloom said. “Hybrid work-from-home, it’s become completely a standard.”  Bloom points out that before the pandemic, many people were already doing some type of hybrid work.  “Most of us probably did some work on the weekend, some work in the evenings. So it isn’t actually such a radical shift to say ‘we’re going to formalize this’,” he said.  The best hybrid mix right now, according to Bloom, is the “boring and predictable” hybrid model of three days in the office and two days working from home. The number of days in this model are not random. Research has shown that people want to work from home on average 2.5 days a week, making the three-two model the closest compromise.  Research shows most people would like to work from home half the time. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images  The plans of companies like Citigroup, Apple and Google will allow most workers to follow this model. Other companies, such as Twitter, are leaving it up to employees to work out with their teams how often they will work in the office.  Some companies that have been testing hybrid models have noticed that employees seem to appreciate this flexibility.  Joanne Wright, vice-president of enterprise operations and services at IBM, said the company had been working on opening its 100 office locations scattered across the country for employees and teams to use as much as they want.  “We know that there’s going to be days when they’re going to work from home and continue to be productive, and there’s days where it makes sense for them to be with a team or clients, collaborating and innovating,” Wright said.  “We were flexible before the pandemic, and that’s what we’ve been trying to drive in this new world, is maybe we need to even think more flexibility than before.”  Management experts stress that return-to-office plans should work toward accommodating balance between employees’ work and non-work lives, and employers need to communicate to their employees that hybrid models are still experimental. Surveys and discussions with employees will be crucial in understanding how return-to-office plans are affecting their lives.  “We’ve never actually been in this place before,” said Heidi Brooks, a lecturer at the Yale School of Management. She said employers needed to be especially aware of how the nature of productivity has changed during the pandemic, when people built their work lives outside the office. “The question that’s now up is: can we transition back and hold on to what works … and all of the gains that were possible when people didn’t have to commute and transition [to the office]?”  Brooks emphasizes the importance of fairness in return-to-office plans and says executives must consider the pandemic’s “differential impacts”, particularly around race and gender. For example, women with young children have to figure out childcare to go into work.  Johnny C Taylor, president and chief executive of the Society for Human Resource Management, said that employers would need to see how return-to-office plans affect morale and a company’s culture, not just worker productivity.  “[A plan] may prove to be incredibly effective, but you may not be creating an environment where people enjoy their work and are engaged,” Taylor said.  Employers also have to be clear about how return-to-office plans balance the needs of employees and the company.  “We have to bring more balance into the discussion that this is good for you, but it also has to be good for us too,” Taylor said, adding that employers needed to be transparent about how they are still figuring out what will work best for the company.  “It is important for employers to be honest about the fact that we don’t really know how this is all going to work out.”

See how they flex forwards as well as back. Notice how responsive and grippy the skin is. The human thumb is not just a device for giving the thumbs-up sign or for picking up dropped keys. It is also one of the most efficient and sensitive tools in existence for determining the ripeness of fruit.  One of the hallmarks of being a hominid is having opposable thumbs: stronger, longer and more flexible than the thumbless hands of a spider monkey or the non-opposable thumbs of a marmoset. These opposable thumbs are a trait that humans share with our primate cousins such as chimpanzees. But it has only recently been discovered that our thumbs might have first evolved as a device for measuring whether or not fruit was ripe. In 2016, biologist Nathaniel Dominy studied the way chimpanzees pick figs. Dominy found that chimpanzees use their dexterous hands to give figs a quick squeeze to determine whether they are ripe or not – a technique that works four times quicker on average than the method used by monkeys (plucking figs at random, biting them to check for ripeness and spitting out the unripe ones).  Humans also have these incredible hands capable of identifying the ripest fruit from touch alone. But most of us don’t use them that way any more. If you want ripe fruit, you no longer need to rely on your own sense of touch. You can go into the nearest supermarket and buy a plastic tub of pre-peeled, pre-sliced mango or melon labelled “ripe and ready” or “ripe and sweet” and eat it with a fork.  One of the most striking things about eating in the modern world is that we do so much of it as if we were sense-blind. We still have the same basic physiognomy as our hunter-gatherer ancestors, yet much of the time, we switch off our senses when choosing what to eat. Our noses can distinguish fresh milk from sour milk, and yet we prefer to look at the use-by date rather than sniffing. Senses, wrote the late anthropologist Jack Goody, are “our windows on the world” – the main tools through which humans acquire information about our environments. Senses are instruments of survival as well as pleasure. But today, we have relinquished many of the functions of our own senses to the modern food industry – which suits that industry just fine. It suits us less well, judging by the current epidemic of diet-related ill health.  Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning  The pandemic revealed what a blind spot our culture has about our own senses, especially our sense of smell. Never before has the loss of a human sense happened so fast, in so many places at once, as the anosmia (smell loss) caused by Covid-19. But perhaps the most noticeable aspect of this mass anosmia is that we lost something that many of us had forgotten we even needed. A sense of smell has long been regarded as something trivial and even inessential to humans (as opposed to other animals, such as dogs, who live by their noses). Charles Darwin was among the scientists and philosophers to argue that a sense of smell was of “extremely slight service” to humans (compared with the senses of vision and hearing). A survey of 7,000 young people in 2011 found that most of them would be hypothetically prepared to give up their sense of smell if it meant that they could keep their laptop or phone.  In reality, it is not easy to live without a sense of smell. We know from survey data produced by the charity Fifth Sense that anosmia lessens enjoyment of food and drink for almost everyone, as well as increasing feelings of loneliness and depression and in some cases leading to the breakdown of relationships. The Fifth Sense survey of nearly 500 anosmia sufferers found that 92% reported enjoying food and drink less than they had when they still had a functioning sense of smell. More than half of the respondents said that they went to restaurants less often than before, and they also reported that cooking had become a source of stress and anxiety because they could no longer experience the joy of trying new recipes, and could not easily tell when something was burned. One Fifth Sense member reported that they missed both the “dangers and delight” of being able to discern the various odours of food. I felt bereft when I came down with Covid in September 2021 and discovered one morning that my usual cup of coffee had lost all its aroma. I sipped in disbelief, waiting for the perfume to return, but all I got was the jolt of caffeine and bitterness on my tongue.  Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./Alamy  From the data so far, it seems that the vast majority of those who lose their sense of smell owing to Covid-19 will achieve a full recovery within a few weeks. I was among this fortunate majority. One day, I zested a lemon and practically cried with gratitude when I noticed the brightness of citrus in the air. But a small percentage of those affected by post-Covid smell loss will never get it back. A 2020 paper analysing the self-reported experiences of long Covid sufferers on a Facebook group gave a sense of how the joy gets sucked out of food for those who can’t smell. Some said that they lost their appetite while others had the opposite reaction, desperately eating more in an attempt to compensate for the loss of pleasure. One person noted that “food satisfaction is lacking and I see myself eating more just to try to get that satisfied feeling … I am gaining weight due to a constant urge to satisfy what can never be satisfied”.  Given the sheer number of people around the world who have suffered from the virus, it seems likely that tens of thousands will be left living with permanent anosmia, or parosmia, a related condition in which those affected are tormented by horrible false smells such as burning rubber. Yet before 2020, very few people even knew the word anosmia, let alone realised it might be something significant for their wellbeing.  Our ignorance about anosmia is part of a wider loss of engagement with our own senses in relation to food. No human activity is more multi-sensory than eating, but to eat in the modern world is often to eat in a state of profound sensory disconnect. We order groceries on a computer, or takeaways on a phone, and they arrive wrapped in plastic, so that we can neither smell them nor see them before we take the first mouthful. Vegetables are sold prechopped and almost all salad is prewashed. Any hint of the soil the food grew in has been erased. We judge the goodness of food by the words on the packet rather than by our own senses. In the US and UK, more than half of all calories consumed are made up of ultra-processed foods whose ingredients are so heavily disguised that they are beyond the power of human senses to disentangle. Very likely, we then eat this meal in front of a screen, barely glancing down to see the colours or shapes of what we are consuming.  Our sensory disconnect from food is both cause and consequence of the fact that so many of us have poor diets. This starts early. Consider commercial baby food. Much of this is now sold as disposable pouches of pureed fruits and vegetables in which the colours and shapes of the original food are hidden. Parents like these pouches – which often boast that their contents are organic – because they are a convenient way to feed a baby or toddler while out of the home. But as a report from the First Steps Nutrition Trust highlighted in 2018, these pouches are not a good way for babies to get their first exposure to food. By sucking food directly from pouch to mouth (which seems to be how they are generally used, even if the manufacturers officially say that they recommend decanting the product into a bowl), children cannot tell what they are eating. Why does this matter? Dr Helen Crawley, a public health nutritionist, has noted that eating purees from a pouch does not help children to get accustomed to the tastes and textures of real food. The problem is that a pouch of sweet carrot gloop does not teach a person either to enjoy or to recognise real carrots.  I first became aware of the extent to which a sensory disconnect from fresh food has become normal when I started conducting taste education sessions with children in British schools a few years ago. I am one of the founders of an organisation called TastEd – short for taste education. TastEd – which is based on the Sapere method used in France, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands – involves bringing fresh vegetables and fruits into the classroom and getting children to use all of their senses to interact with them. The programme, which is now taught by nursery and primary teachers in more than 160 schools in England, consists of a range of free teaching materials designed to help children to get to know basic foodstuffs by touching, smelling, listening and looking at them, as well as eventually tasting.

Don’t children learn this stuff at home? But apparently they don’t, or at least nothing like as much as they did in the past. Some parents are forced to work such long hours that they hardly get the chance to share family meals with their children. Many others are on such squeezed incomes that fresh food can be more or less unaffordable. For families of all incomes in the west, there is an additional cultural problem, which is that it is not seen as normal for children to enjoy fresh vegetables. Whatever the reason, the average child now seems to have a very limited sensory literacy of food. In 2010, the TV show Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution showed American children in West Virginia who believed that tomatoes were potatoes and who said that an aubergine was a pear. At the time, I recall hearing people commenting that the children’s ignorance was symptomatic of living in West Virginia. In fact, you will now find children all over Britain with a similar lack of food knowledge.  A few summers ago, while I was first trialling the lessons alongside a reception class teacher in Cambridge, it was peach season and I bought some delicious flat peaches to share with a class of four- and five-year-olds. One boy leaned forwards and said: “I’ve never touched a peach before, but I’ve had peach-flavoured medicine.” This boy had never known the fuzzy sensation of peach skin on his hand or in his mouth, or the quiet squelching noise a peach makes when you bite into it. This wasn’t unusual. The following summer I brought peaches into another classroom, this time with year 4 classes. One nine-year-old girl stared blankly at the fruit and told me she was surprised real peaches didn’t look more like the peach emoji.  Since then, we’ve met 10-year-old children who have never tasted a carrot or a raw tomato, and who have no idea what it feels like to hold an onion or a potato. There are children who could name every football team in the Premier League in the correct order but don’t know that cherries come with stones inside, because they have never seen anyone eating one, never mind tried one for themselves. Teachers have told us about children who smelled a fresh mint leaf and the only thing it reminded them of was chewing gum and mint-scented shampoo.  Jason O’Rourke, the head teacher of Washingborough Academy in Lincolnshire and one of the founders of TastEd, has told me that when asked where food comes from, children at his school used to say “from the supermarket”. Now they say “from Mummy’s iPad”. The deep ignorance that children have about food is part of something much bigger: a global food system in which the chains of distribution are so long and impersonal that very few of us – adults or children – have any connection with the people who grew or reared what we eat.  The sensory disconnect of modern life didn’t happen all at once. We are living at the endpoint of many centuries of sensory disengagement from our food. Although the idea of the five senses is near-universal across human societies, each culture has its own ways of conceptualising those senses. The cultures in which sensory knowledge of food – particularly through smell – are most vivid are hunter-gatherer communities.  When most humans were hunter-gatherers, no one could afford to eat with their senses switched off. You needed to be able to sniff out the difference between a poisonous berry and a sweet one, and to listen alertly for the footsteps of wild game. For hunter-gatherers, senses are survival. This became less urgent with the adoption of farming in the neolithic period. Suddenly, not everyone in the community was responsible for foraging or hunting their own food, because we could rely on farmers to supply us with grain.  Anthropologists have found that as societies modernise, one of the common patterns is that the sense of smell becomes less important and the sense of sight becomes more so. Asifa Majid, a professor of psychology at the University of York and a leading expert on olfactory language, has said that smell used to be considered a “mute sense” compared with sight because English speakers have far fewer words for describing smells than they do for colours.  But Majid’s field work has shown that for certain hunter-gatherer communities, smells can be named as easily as colours. Among the nomadic Seri community in Mexico for example, speakers have different words to distinguish between the specific smell of sea lion, the smell of spoiled beans, the smell of burned beans, the smell of cooking immature green sea turtle and the smell of rancid honey. For the Seri, this rich smellscape is a crucial part of everyday life. By contrast, someone living in London or New York today might smell the burned beans just as potently as the Seri, but have no word for the particular way it smelled beyond “yuck”.  As Majid writes: “In English, a stink is a stink is a stink.” We sometimes make fun of wine writers for describing the perfume of different wines in such pretentious terms (“a bouquet of liquorice” or “topnotes of gooseberry”), but similes are often the only way we can describe smells with any precision in English because our odour vocabulary is so limited.  Long after the decline of hunter-gathering, however, selecting food continued to be deeply sensual. The historian Madeleine Ferrières has described the order in which a buyer would traditionally use his or her senses when buying food at a medieval food market in France. The first task was to smell, because it was common knowledge that “everything that stinks, kills”. Next came close looking, to confirm that the food really was as fresh as it seemed. The next sense was touch, taking the food in the hand to gauge its weight and assess its quality. Finally, a buyer might taste a little of the food to determine whether the produce really was fit to eat. In the French civil code, consumers had a right to touch and taste a sample of the food before they committed to buying it.  Photograph: Mira/Alamy  A sensory approach to food shopping continues to be normal to some degree wherever there are open-air food markets. Traditionally, to test whether a watermelon was ripe, Chinese consumers would tap on it. Ripe melons make a hollow sound. In the UK we used to do something similar with a variety of apples called Cox’s Orange Pippin. You would shake the apple, and if it was ripe the seeds would make a gentle rattling sound.  Now we have largely lost the sensory experience of handling food when we buy it. All over the world, open-air markets are being supplanted by supermarket shopping. The seductive promise of the supermarket is that it will do most of the job of hunting and gathering for you. All of the produce for sale in these vast cathedrals of commerce has already been vetted and packaged and labelled and then assembled under one roof by someone else for your convenience, so that you can focus your time and energy on other things.  I will never forget how ecstatic my mother was on her trips to the first big Sainsbury’s in our town in the early 1980s. This anonymous and well-stocked marketplace spared her – a working parent – the bother of traipsing between separate markets and shops such as grocers and bakers as she had previously done. One of the tradeoffs of this convenience, however, was that food shopping became something less sensory than it had been before. When I try to remember how the Sainsbury’s of my childhood smelled, my mind is a blank, whereas I can still vividly recall the fresh grassy smell of the greengrocers where my mother used to go before, and the stale blood odour of the butcher where we bought our joint for the Sunday roast, and the heavenly scent of the warm bags of freshly ground coffee from the tiny coffee shop in the covered market.  In the early 2000s, two French sociologists studied how the sensory experience of food shopping started to change in Vietnam with the arrival of supermarkets. They found that in traditional markets, Vietnamese shoppers tended to pay great attention to the sensory qualities of different foods. They looked carefully for tomatoes that were pinky-red in colour with intact stalks, suggesting that the tomatoes had not travelled far. When buying meat, they smelled it and touched it with a finger to check for freshness. With the rapid expansion of supermarkets in Vietnam, this kind of close sensory observation became impossible. “In supermarkets, I buy without looking,” said one respondent. A similar process has taken place in Hong Kong, where researchers found that older shoppers had a much wider food-smell vocabulary than younger people. Older people had words for the particular odour of salted fish, of old tofu and of stale peanuts, whereas younger shoppers tended to speak only of food that was “fragrant” and food that was “stinky”.  All of this is part of a bigger revolution in eating over the past 50 to 70 years. It is one element in a process that Prof Barry Popkin has called the “nutrition transition”, which has happened all over the world as countries undergo economic development, and has transformed how and what people eat almost everywhere. There has been a shift from meals to snacks; from savoury to sweet; from local, homemade dishes to the same homogenised, ultra-processed foods made by multinational food companies.  This nutrition transition has seen a fall in the rates of global hunger, but it has also ushered in a vast rise in the prevalence of diet-related diseases, ranging from type-2 diabetes to heart disease, depression, asthma and some forms of cancer. In recent years, the concept of “malnutrition” has changed to include obesity as well as absolute hunger. In middle-income countries such as Brazil, rising numbers of people are both under- and over-nourished at the same time – suffering from a surfeit of calories but a dearth of the crucial micronutrients and protein our bodies need to stay healthy.  The question is whether it is possible to retain the prosperity of the nutrition transition while moving towards a less destructive economy of food. The problem cannot be fixed without radical government intervention. Healthy food needs to be made the affordable, available and normal option. This reform is all the more urgent in the wake of the war in Ukraine – the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter – which will push the price of basic staples to unaffordable levels for many households. But while we wait for this structural reform to happen, what can we as individuals do to eat in happier and healthier ways?  One suggestion is that we start trusting our own senses more, and the slogans on food packets less. The food writer Michael Pollan once said: “If you’re concerned about your health, you should probably avoid food products that make health claims. Why? Because a health claim on a food product is a good indication that it’s not really food, and food is what you want to eat.”  When you really pay attention to what all five senses are telling you about food, you might automatically start to eat in a different and more pleasurable way. You might eat less, but appreciate what you are eating more. You reconnect with your own body and its relationship with food – at least, this has been my experience. I notice that when I am cooking, if I can breathe in all of the scents and sights of the cooking process, I feel nourished by them before I even sit down to eat.  The cookery writer Diana Henry has written frankly of how she released herself from a destructive cycle of yo-yo dieting, which she calls “the whole deprivation/rebellion, eating too little/overindulging rollercoaster”. In her 2014 book A Change of Appetite, Henry described how she was helped in this by adopting some of the principles of Japanese cuisine, which involve an intense appreciation of the sensory details in a meal.  Photograph: Popa Ioana/Alamy  Instead of asking how many calories a meal contains – calorie-counting is the very antithesis of sensory – a more fruitful and guilt-free approach to healthy eating is to notice and enjoy the balance of colours and textures and techniques in a meal while you are cooking and eating it. As Henry writes, “Eating is not just about sating appetite, but about appreciating, with all your senses, what is put before you.”  In some cases, making better use of the sense of smell can be a way to restore appetite when it has vanished. Many people living with dementia lose their interest in food and can become at risk of malnutrition. In 2013, Rodd, a British design firm, launched a new product called Ode aimed at helping dementia sufferers to eat better. The device releases waves of familiar food fragrances three times a day, in order to trigger positive food memories, and hence a desire to eat. The fragrances include comfort foods such as fruit pies, casseroles and curries.During a test phase, Rodd found that around 50% of the dementia sufferers who had been exposed to the food smells either stabilised their weight or gained weight.  There are signs that modern societies could yet transition towards a new and more engaged culture of the senses. One factor helping to make this change could be the anti-plastics movement. On 1 January this year, the French government banned supermarkets and other shops from selling 30 types of fruits and vegetables – including cucumbers – in plastic wrapping. The motive for the reform was ecological rather than sensory: the French environment minister said that there must be limits on the “outrageous” proliferation of single-use plastic.  Some have defended items such as the shrink-wrapped cucumber on the grounds that the plastic actually helps reduce food waste. Stephen Dubner, author of Freakonomics, has cited evidence from cucumber growers that just 1.5g of plastic wrap can extend a cucumber’s life in the fridge by as much as 14 days. But at the same time, the plastic wrap makes it harder for the consumer to use his or her own senses to judge the freshness of the cucumber inside. An unintended side-effect of the plastics ban in France will be to bring supermarket shoppers closer to raw ingredients as they buy them. They will once again have the chance to see the dimples on a naked lemon before they buy it, or to smell the pungency of a leek that is not cloistered in plastic. If this reform could be repeated in other countries (Spain is to follow suit in 2023), it would be a significant step towards using our senses more actively when we eat.  A second reason to be hopeful is the rise in home cooking that happened during Covid lockdowns. Consumer research suggests that across Europe and beyond in 2020, there was a rise in purchases of ingredients for cooking from scratch, such as flour. People in Spain, Italy and Greece reported enjoying experimenting with new recipes during the pandemic. Anyone who cooks regularly will by definition use their senses in an active way. To cook is to become attuned to the scent of garlic sizzling in a pan, or the sound of a mushroom squeaking as it cooks. You learn to feel the smoothness of properly kneaded dough in your hand, or to notice the way that lentils or rice swells when it is perfectly cooked.  A third source of hope is provided by sensory food education. Learning to use all five senses more actively when eating is a teachable skill. In Britain, the new National Food Strategy authored by Henry Dimbleby in 2021 called for sensory food education to be a basic part of every young child’s education for nursery and reception classes. The evidence suggests that even a short course of sensory food education can help to broaden a child’s food tastes. A study from Finland found that sensory-based food education of pre-school children increased their willingness to eat a range of foods including fruits, vegetables and berries.  This effect was noticed even among children who were classified by their parents as “picky eaters”. Anecdotally, we have seen the same positive effects with TastEd. A teacher at the University of Cambridge primary school reported in autumn 2021 that a child in her class who had previously been phobic of new foods, and had been receiving specialist help from a dietitian for two years, had suddenly felt able to try three new fruits during a TastEd lesson. It seemed there was something about using her senses so actively that made the process of eating become something lighter and more pleasurable.  Perhaps the greatest cause for hope that a new culture of the senses may yet emerge is that although we live and eat in a world vastly different from our hunter-gatherer ancestors, we are still the same sensory beings underneath. If you want to start eating differently, the power is, to a large extent, in your own hands – with those marvellous opposable thumbs – as well as in your nose. (I am talking here about people who have enough to eat. Sensory joy and hunger do not go together.) Those of us who are still lucky enough to have a sense of smell should try to use it to the full while we can. Keep small pots of herbs in the kitchen or the garden if you have one. When feeling low, pick a mint leaf, rub it on your hand and inhale deeply.  Try to know your food with your ears, nose and hands as well as with your eyes. Smell it, touch it and look at it before you taste it. Explore the complex world of joy that is spice. Notice the many differences between fake emoji peaches and real peaches. Learn to recognise the equally huge differences between ultra-processed bread and real bread. Start to relish a range of tastes that go beyond sweetness. Appreciate the bitterness of grapefruit or the sourness of rhubarb. Next time you eat a particularly delicious pizza, try to notice why it was so pleasing: was it the dough, the sauce, the cheese or all three? Feel the ridges on a stick of celery or the soft embroidery on a leaf of kale. A human who eats without engaging their senses of smell, sound and touch is like someone who observes the world through a pane of frosted glass. For as long as you still can, squeeze the figs and smell the coffee. Come to your senses.

Yet in this 95,000-student district, officials took mask compliance a step further than most.  Through a network of security cameras, officials harnessed artificial intelligence to identify students whose masks drooped below their noses.  “If they say a picture is worth a thousand words, if I send you a piece of video – it’s probably worth a million,” said Paul Hildreth, the district’s emergency operations coordinator. “You really can’t deny, ‘Oh yeah, that’s me, I took my mask off.’”  The school district in Fulton county had installed the surveillance network, by Motorola-owned Avigilon, years before the pandemic shuttered schools nationwide in 2020. Out of fear of mass school shootings, districts in recent years have increasingly deployed controversial surveillance networks like cameras with facial recognition and gun detection.  With the pandemic, security vendors switched directions and began marketing their wares as a solution to stop the latest threat. In Fulton county, the district used Avigilon’s “no face mask detection” technology to identify students with their faces exposed.  Remote learning during the pandemic ushered in a new era of digital student surveillance as schools turned to AI-powered services like remote proctoring and digital tools that sift through billions of students’ emails and classroom assignments in search of threats and mental health warning signs. Back on campus, districts have rolled out tools like badges that track students’ every move.  But one of the most significant developments has been in AI-enabled cameras. Twenty years ago, security cameras were present in 19% of schools, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Today, that number exceeds 80%. Powering those cameras with artificial intelligence makes automated surveillance possible, enabling things like temperature checks and the collection of other biometric data.  Districts across the country have said they had bought AI-powered cameras to fight the pandemic. But as pandemic-era protocols like mask mandates end, experts said the technology will remain. Some educators have stated plans to leverage pandemic-era surveillance tech for student discipline while others hope AI cameras will help them identify youth carrying guns.  The cameras have faced sharp resistance from civil rights advocates who question their effectiveness and argue they trample students’ privacy rights.  Noa Young, a 16-year-old high school junior in Fulton county, said she knew that cameras monitored her school but wasn’t aware of their hi-tech features like mask detection. She agreed with the district’s now-expired mask mandate but felt that educators should have been more transparent about the technology.  “I think it’s helpful for Covid stuff but it seems a little intrusive,” Young said in an interview. “I think it’s strange that we were not aware of that.”  Campus security associate Sandra Swint monitors security camera feeds from a school in Fulton county, Georgia. The district’s schools are equipped with high-tech security cameras from the company Avigilon. Photograph: Fulton County  Outside Fulton county, educators have used AI cameras to fight Covid on multiple fronts.  In Rockland regional school unit 13 in Maine, officials used federal pandemic relief money to procure a network of cameras with “face match” technology for contact tracing. Through advanced surveillance, the cameras, made by California-based security company Verkada, allow the 1,600-student district to identify students who came in close contact with classmates who tested positive for Covid-19.  At a district in suburban Houston, officials spent nearly $75,000 on AI-enabled cameras from Hikvision, a surveillance company owned in part by the Chinese government, and deployed thermal imaging and facial detection to identify students with elevated temperatures and those without masks.  The cameras can screen as many as 30 people at a time and are therefore “less intrusive” than slower processes, said Ty Morrow, the Brazosport independent school district’s head of security. The checkpoints have helped the district identify students who later tested positive for Covid-19, Morrow said, although a surveillance testing company has argued Hikvision’s claim of accurately scanning 30 people at once is not possible.  “That was just one more tool that we had in the toolbox to show parents that we were doing our due diligence to make sure that we weren’t allowing kids or staff with Covid into the facilities,” he said.  Yet it’s this mentality that worries consultant Kenneth Trump, the president of Cleveland-based National School Safety and Security Services. Security hardware for the sake of public perception, the industry expert said, is simply “smoke and mirrors”.  “It’s creating a facade,” he said. “Parents think that all the bells and whistles are going to keep their kids safer and that’s not necessarily the case. With cameras, in the vast majority of schools, nobody is monitoring them.”  When the Fulton county district upgraded its surveillance camera network in 2018, officials were wooed by Avigilon’s AI-powered “appearance search”, which allows security officials to sift through a mountain of video footage and identify students based on characteristics like their hairstyle or the color of their shirt. When the pandemic hit, the company’s mask detection became an attractive add-on, Hildreth said.  He said the district didn’t actively advertise the technology to students but they probably became aware of it quickly after students got called out for breaking the rules. He doesn’t know students’ opinions about the cameras – or seem to care.  “I wasn’t probably as much interested in their reaction as much as their compliance,” Hildreth said. “You don’t have to like something that’s good for you, but you still need to do it.”  A Fulton county district spokesperson said they were unaware of any instances where students were disciplined because the cameras caught them without masks.  Among the school security industry’s staunchest critics is Sneha Revanur, a 17-year-old high school student from San Jose, California, who founded the youth-led group Encode Justice to highlight the dangers of artificial intelligence on civil liberties.  Revanur said she was concerned by districts’ decisions to implement surveillance cameras as a public health strategy and that the technology in schools could result in harsher discipline for students, particularly youth of color.  Verkada offers a cautionary tale. Last year, the company suffered a massive data breach when a hack exposed the live feeds of 150,000 surveillance cameras, including those inside Tesla factories, jails and at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. The Newtown district, which suffered a mass school shooting in 2012, said the breach didn’t expose compromising information about students. The vulnerability hasn’t deterred some educators from contracting with the California-based company.  After a back-and-forth with the Verkada spokesperson, the company would not grant an interview or respond to a list of written questions.  Revanur called the Verkada hack at Sandy Hook elementary a “staggering indictment” of educators’ rush for “dragnet surveillance systems that treat everyone as a constant suspect” at the expense of student privacy. Constant monitoring, she argued, “creates this culture of fear and paranoia that truly isn’t the most proactive response to gun violence and safety concerns”.  In Fayette county, Georgia, the district spent about $500,000 to buy 70 Hikvision cameras with thermal imaging to detect students with fevers. But it ultimately backtracked and disabled them after community uproar over their efficacy and Hikvision’s ties to the Chinese government. In 2019, the US government imposed a trade blacklist on Hikvision, alleging the company was implicated in China’s “campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance” against Muslim ethnic minorities.  The school district declined to comment. In a statement, a Hikvision spokesperson said the company “takes all reports regarding human rights very seriously” and has engaged governments globally “to clarify misunderstandings about the company”. The company is “committed to upholding the right to privacy”, the spokesperson said.  Meanwhile, regional school unit 13’s decision to use Verkada security cameras as a contact tracing tool could run afoul of a 2021 law that bans the use of facial recognition in Maine schools. The district didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Michael Kebede, the ACLU of Maine’s policy counsel, cited recent studies on facial recognition’s flaws in identifying children and people of color and called on the district to reconsider its approach.  “We fundamentally disagree that using a tool of mass surveillance is a way to promote the health and safety of students,” Kobede said in a statement. “It is a civil liberties nightmare for everyone, and it perpetuates the surveillance of already marginalized communities.”  ‘We’ve got some false positives’  In Fulton county, school officials wound up disabling the face mask detection feature in cafeterias because it was triggered by people eating lunch. Other times, it identified students who pulled their masks down briefly to take a drink of water.  In suburban Houston, Morrow ran into similar hurdles. When white students wore light-colored masks, for example, the face detection sounded alarms. And if students rode bikes to school, the cameras flagged their elevated temperatures.  “We’ve got some false positives but it was not a failure of the technology,” Hildreth said. “We just had to take a look and adapt what we were looking at to match our needs.”  With those lessons learned, Hildreth said he hoped to soon equip Fulton county campuses with AI-enabled cameras that identify students who bring guns to school.  In a post-pandemic world, Albert Fox Cahn, founder of the non-profit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, worries the entire school security industry will take a similar approach.  “With the pandemic hopefully waning, we’ll see a lot of security vendors pivoting back to school shooting rhetoric as justification for the camera systems,” he said. Due to the potential for errors, Cahn called the embrace of AI surveillance in schools “really alarming”.

The fine was a relatively light sentence after French president Emmanuel Macron offered her consular 'protection' and said he would raise her case with Vladimir Putin.  Ovsyannikova was fined for a video statement she made before the protest, in which she said she was ashamed of having worked at Channel One and spreading 'Kremlin propaganda', not for breaking on to the Channel One set

Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Wednesday implemented the “early warning phase” of an existing gas emergency plan, where a crisis team from the economics ministry, the regulator and the private sector will monitor imports and storage.  Habeck told reporters Germany’s gas supplies were guaranteed for now but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that “every kilowatt hour counts”.

Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP  If supplies fall short, Germany’s network regulator can ration gas, with industry first in line for cuts and preferential treatment for private households, hospitals and other critical institutions.  Paying in Russia’s currency would undercut the effectiveness of western sanctions on the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and Germany, which depends on Russia for much of its natural gas, is under pressure not to accede to the demand.  Moscow is expected to make public its plans for rouble payments on Thursday, Reuters says, although it said it would not immediately demand that buyers pay for gas exports in the currency.  As analysts waited for more clarity on the situation and whether Russia would cut off supplies, figures showed that March was the most expensive month for power prices in European history, analysts at Rystad Energy said on Thursday, breaking the record set in December for the big five European markets (Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain).    Italy will end up with highest average prices, above €300 for the month of March.  UK, France and Spain are not far behind, all close to €300, and then a sizable gap down to Germany around €250 and the Nordics around €140.

A party shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that this failure or delay is the direct result of a Force Majeure Event, provided that the Affected Party has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or overcome that failure. If the Force Majeure Event prevents the Affected Party from materially complying with its obligations under this Agreement and it continues for more than 30 days, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice.  18.5.

Therefore, the parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement, GNM shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or other relief prohibiting any breach of this Agreement without giving an undertaking as to damages.

A day after Russia promised to scale down operations near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, an intensified bombardment could be heard in the suburbs of the capital, near the areas retaken by Ukrainian forces in recent days.  Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said that Ukrainian forces had full control of the town, but asked residents not to return to the town and revealed that bodies were still trapped under rubble

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko  Summary Ukraine prepares for fresh Russian attacks  Russian troops pull back from capital Kyiv  Economic impact of war felt, gas supplies in focus  LVIV, March 31 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces are preparing for new Russian attacks in the southeast region where Moscow's guns are now trained after its assault on the capital Kyiv was repelled, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.  Five weeks into an invasion that has blasted cities into wastelands and created more than 4 million refugees, U.S. and European officials said Russian president Vladimir Putin was misled by his generals about the dire performance of Russia's military. read more  Tough resistance by Ukrainian forces has prevented Russia from capturing any major city, including the capital Kyiv, which it assaulted with armoured columns from the northwest and east.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Moscow says it is now focusing on "liberating" the Donbas region - two southeastern provinces partly controlled by separatists Russia has backed since 2014.  In an early morning video address, Zelenskiy said Russian troop movements away from Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv were not a withdrawal but rather "the consequence of our defenders' work".  Ukraine was seeing "a build-up of Russian forces for new strikes on the Donbas and we are preparing for that," he said.  That includes Mariupol, once a city of 400,000 people, where most buildings have been damaged or destroyed in four weeks of constant Russian bombardment and siege. A convoy of Ukrainian buses set out for the port city on Thursday to try to reach trapped civilians, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.  The United Nations believes thousands of people have died there, many buried in unmarked graves.  The past week has seen a Ukrainian counter-offensive, recapturing destroyed suburbs of Kyiv and strategic towns and villages in the northeast and southwest. Russia declared on Monday that it was scaling back its offensive near the capital and the city of Chernihiv in the north, in what it called a trust-building gesture for peace talks.  PUTIN MISLED, U.S. SAYS  Russia says it launched a "special military operation" to disarm and "denazify" its neighbour, and that the mission is going to plan.  Western countries say the invasion was an unprovoked war of aggression, that Russia's true aim was to swiftly topple the government in Kyiv, and that its failure has been a strategic catastrophe, bringing economic ruin and diplomatic isolation.  U.S. officials have declassified intelligence which they said showed a rift between Putin and his advisors, who failed to warn him of the poor performance of his military or the economic impact of Western sanctions.  “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,” Kate Bedingfield, White House communications director, told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday.  “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisors are too afraid to tell him the truth.”  A senior European diplomat said the U.S. assessment was in line with European thinking. "Putin thought things were going better than they were. That's the problem with surrounding yourself with 'yes men.'" the diplomat said.  Military analysts have described Russia's announcement of a focus on the Donbas as an attempt to reframe its war goals to make it easier for Putin to claim a face-saving victory. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-backed separatist leader in the Donbas province that includes Mariupol, said on Wednesday offensive operations were intensifying.  All previous efforts to reach Ukrainian-held parts of Mariupol with aid or buses to evacuate civilians have failed. On Thursday, however, Ukraine said it was now sending a relief convoy through a humanitarian corridor with the backing of the Red Cross, which had secured agreement with the Russians.  In Russian-held parts of Mariupol people occasionally climb out of cellars to appear, ghostlike, among the ruins.  Pavel was placing a bowl and spoon as a tribute on a makeshift grave, in a patch of grass outside a wrecked apartment block, marked with a plain wooden cross.  "Our friend. March 16. Driving in a car. A bullet hit him in the throat. He was dead in five minutes," he said. "I was in the car. I brought him home."  Three older women sat bundled in coats at a picnic table outside the basement where they shelter. One was slicing a cabbage on some old newspaper.  "There's no food, no water, no gas," said Viktor, hovering over a makeshift wood stove on the basement steps nearby. "We cook what we find among neighbours. A bit of cabbage, a bit more of potatoes, we've found tomato paste, some beetroot."  Western sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for its invasion have largely isolated its economy from world trade, but Moscow is still the biggest supplier of oil and gas to Europe.  The United States is considering releasing up to 180 million barrels of oil over several months from its Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) to ease upward pressure on prices, two U.S. sources said. Oil prices fell more than $5 a barrel on Thursday on the news. read more  International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries were set to hold an emergency meeting on Friday at 1200 GMT to decide on a collective oil release, a spokesperson for New Zealand's energy minister said on Thursday.  Russia has demanded European payments for its gas be made in roubles by Friday, raising fears of energy shortages. Germany has warned of a possible emergency if Russia cuts supplies. read more  A German government spokesperson said Putin had told Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday that payments could still be made in euros to Gazprombank, a bank affiliated with the Russian gas export monopoly, which would convert the money to roubles.  However, the Russian business newspaper Kommersant said Gazprom was looking into shutting off supplies: "Gazprom ... is indeed working on an option of a complete stoppage of gas supplies to 'unfriendly countries' and is evaluating the consequences of such measures," it wrote. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Reuters bureaus Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko  MARIUPOL, Ukraine, March 30 (Reuters) - Amid the burnt-out frames of shelled buildings and bare branches of trees, only a children's playground set, now abandoned, lends colour to this neighbourhood in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.  The port city, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000, has been a strategic focus of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began five weeks ago, and has suffered near-constant bombardment.  Nearly 5,000 people have been killed, the mayor's office estimated on Monday, and about 170,000 people remain trapped amid ruins without food, heat, power or running water. Many more have fled. Reuters has been unable to verify the figures.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Everybody seems to know someone who has been killed.  "On March 16, our friend was driving a car, and a bullet got him right in the throat. Five minutes later he was gone," said a man who gave his first name only as Pavel, standing next to a freshly covered grave adorned with a simple wooden cross, near his garage.  The port city has become a mass grave as residents bury their neighbours and family members near the apartment buildings where they used to live.  Pavel said he was with his friend Igor in the car at the time and only managed to take him home before he died.  Mariupol has been targeted in an apparent attempt by Russia to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, and pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. It calls its actions a "special operation."  Safe evacuation corridors have functioned only sporadically at best. Instead, residents who have been unable to leave the city hide in the basements of buildings and prepare what food they can find in the open.  "We cook what we find among neighbours. A bit of cabbage, a bit more of potatoes, we've found tomato paste, some beetroot," said former steel worker Viktor. They cook using a rudimentary barbecue and sleep in a basement, which he termed their "peaceful oasis."  "We have nowhere to take a shower, we are drinking water from God knows where," said a woman named Lyudmila, who was in the basement with Viktor.

Here is a timeline of main events there. read more  Feb. 24 - Russia launches a full-scale invasion of Ukraine from three fronts and begins to advance towards Mariupol from parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed separatists, and from annexed Crimea in the south. Local authorities say 26 people are admitted to hospital after parts of the city are shelled.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  March 1 - Mayor Vadym Boichenko says the city has been under shelling for five days. The next day, Boichenko says Mariupol has been hit non-stop for 14 hours.  March 2 - Mariupol says it has lost power, and has no running water or gas supplies. Boichenko says Russian forces are blocking the exit of civilians and local authorities later pinpoint this day as the start of Russia's blockade. Russia reiterates that it does not target civilians.  March 5 - Russia and Ukraine agree a partial ceasefire to open a humanitarian corridor for several hours. The ceasefire collapses, with both sides blaming each other, and a safe corridor is not established for another week.  March 9 - City authorities say a Russian airstrike has hit a maternity hospital. They say three people are killed and later report the death of another pregnant woman. Russia says, without producing evidence, that the hospital had no patients. Ukraine says Russia's assertion is a lie.  March 13 - The city council says the last supplies of food and water are running out.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko/File Photo  March 14 - A humanitarian corridor is agreed with Russia and a convoy of evacuees, in at least 160 private cars, manages to leave Mariupol. By mid-afternoon on March 15, 2,000 cars have left.  March 16 - Local authorities say Russian bombs hit Mariupol’s Drama Theatre while hundreds were sheltering there. The mayor's office estimates on March 25 that the death toll was about 300. Russia denies bombing the theatre.  March 18 - Russia says its forces have entered the centre of Mariupol. Boichenko says fighting in the city is "really active."  March 19 - Ukraine accuses Russia of illegally deporting thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia under the guise of evacuation after Russian media reported that "evacuation buses" were carrying hundreds of civilians from Mariupol to Russia. On March 24, Mariupol authorities update the figure to 15,000.  March 21 - Moscow sets an ultimatum for Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to lay down their arms, saying they will be given safe passage out of the city. Ukraine rejects the proposal, saying there can be no question of surrender.  March 28 - The office of Boichenko, who has left the city, estimates that nearly 5,000 people have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the siege. It also estimates that 90% of the buildings have been damaged and 40% destroyed. About 290,000 people have left the city and about 170,000 are still trapped, it says.  March 29 - Britain's Ministry of Defence assesses Mariupol’s city centre to still be under Ukrainian control. Russia says at talks in Turkey that it will scale down military operations around the capital Kyiv and Chernihiv in northern Ukraine but makes no mention of Mariupol.  March 30 - A Ukrainian presidential adviser says street fighting is heavy in Mariupol and half the city is in the hands of Russian forces.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez  LONDON/ZURICH/NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Yevgeny Chichvarkin, a telecoms tycoon who fled Russia in 2008 and became a high-profile London restaurateur, has long been a vocal supporter of Ukraine.  Together with partner Tatiana Fokina, the multimillionaire says he has sent four truckloads of medical and protective equipment to Poland to help Ukrainians since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.  Chichvarkin, a burly man with a waxed moustache, said he drove the first load himself.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But the 48-year-old entrepreneur, a long-time critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he has just unexpectedly had one of his Swiss bank accounts frozen. He declined to say by which bank.  Chichvarkin is one of a growing number of Russians living abroad who are finding issues accessing their money, even when they are not the direct targets of Western sanctions.  Reuters interviews with nine Russians living overseas - as well as their wealth managers, lawyers, tax advisers, real estate and art brokers - suggest that Western sanctions meant to punish Putin's inner circle are also broadly ensnaring Russian passport holders.  Four Russians living overseas with dual citizenship described banks freezing their accounts or payments in London, Zurich and Paris. One wealthy émigré in London said he had switched to cash to make purchases and was keeping a low profile.  Two wealth advisors and a lawyer described applications for bank accounts by Russian clients being rejected. Banks said they were taking extra precautions with Russian money. And three brokers said some real estate and art deals had stalled.  A Canadian-American lawyer said his Russian clients were afraid to take international trips for fear of being stopped at customs as Western banks cast a wide blanket of suspicion on Russian money - even donations to charities. Dual passports no longer provide escape routes as they once did.  "I am dealing with Russians who can't get out of hotels, students who have no money because credit cards are valueless," said Bob Amsterdam, a founding partner of Washington- and London-based law firm Amsterdam & Partners.  "Banks ... are refusing Russians bank accounts: they are closing their doors to Russians on nationality," said Amsterdam, who is based in London. "Leading law firms in the City have closed their doors to Russians in terms of nationality."  'YOU NEED TO BE VERY QUIET'  Several lawyers representing wealthy Russians in Europe spoke about a pervasive climate of distrust. One tax and wealth planning expert, who asked not to be named due to a climate that she said penalized association with Russia, said that Russians were being scrutinized regardless of their place of residence or wealth.  "Currently, everything that is Russian is toxic, which means that everyone is trying to be extremely, extremely careful in terms of what to do with Russian clients," said the lawyer, a dual Russian and British citizen, who runs a law firm in Zurich.  Journalist Elena Servettaz, a dual citizen who has lived in France since 2005, said French bank Crédit Mutuel rejected a transfer of less than 1,000 euros to her account -- money sent to her from London to support Ukrainian refugee aid efforts.  When Servettaz called the bank, she was told the transaction had been flagged due to her Russian nationality. Servettaz received the money more than a week later.  "It's so unfair when you are part of the Russian opposition, you're helping Ukrainian refugees, and they're saying you're Russian so you can't have your money," Servettaz said.  Crédit Mutuel said that European banks were obliged to apply "the greatest prudence" in scrutinising transactions that could be affected by E.U. sanctions, and that additional checks required to ensure compliance could lead to delays, though it was doing its best to limit the effects on customers.  A Crédit Mutuel spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the situation relating to Servetta "was quickly resolved once the customer sent us the requested information."  Reuters reported this month that European Union regulators have told some banks to scrutinise transactions by all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents. read more  Some wealth managers in Europe have sought to distance themselves from economic and political fallout. Switzerland's Julius Baer (BAER.S) this month began blocking new business with Russian clients, two sources familiar with the operations said. UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said all Russian passport holders have effectively become semi-sanctioned. read more  Julius Baer said it was not accepting new Russian clients with a Russian domicile but continued to serve existing Russian clients "in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations or sanctions."  Russian writer Grigory Chkhartishvili, who lives in London and whose last name is Georgian, successfully transferred a sum of money through British bank Barclays to support his Ukrainian refugee assistance charity, True Russia.  But his wife, whose last name is Russian, was blocked by Barclays when attempting to send money to the same charity, he said. The bank requested a face-to-face interview with her.  "My sum was ten times bigger, but it was no problem," Chkhartishvili said. "It shows the atmosphere."  Chkhartishvili said his wife, who declined to be interviewed by Reuters and asked for her name not to be made public, had told him she was able to transfer the money the next day after she called the bank and explained that she was helping Ukrainian refugees.  Barclays did not respond to a request for comment.  A wealthy Russian oil and banking magnate, who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely about his financial situation, said he felt he had become "collateral damage" from Russia's invasion - which Moscow calls a "special operation".  Based in London for three decades, he said he still had businesses in Russia and was anxious about greater financial restrictions, despite not being on a sanctions list.  "I have some savings," he said, adding he was considering selling European assets. "You need to live out of cash ... You need to be very quiet."  'RUSSOPHOBIA'  In the basement of one of his newest ventures, The White Horse pub in London's upmarket Mayfair district, Chichvarkin says he is confident his lawyers will be able to unfreeze his Swiss bank account.  It is the only account of his that has been frozen, he said. He believes that is because it is the only one he opened with a Russian passport.  At the same time, Chichvarkin believes his and his partner's opposition to Putin and the war, as well as their vocal support for Ukraine, has helped protect their businesses from anti-Russian hostility by customers and the public, stirred by what Fokina calls "Putin's war".  Still, their Michelin-starred restaurant Hide - which they own alongside wine boutique Hedonism Wines, where a bottle can cost 124,000 pounds ($163,500) - received a one-star Google review about two weeks into the war, Fokina's assistant said.  The rare poor review, among 1,767 others that give the restaurant an average 4.5-star rating, said simply: "Russian owned". It has since been removed.  "You read about people cancelling Tchaikovsky concerts, people vandalising Russian food shops," said Fokina. "This is London 2022. How did we get here so quickly?"

REUTERS/Mike Blake  Summary Mulls release of up to 180 mln bbls of oil over several months  IEA calls for emergency meeting on Friday - Australia, New Zealand, Japan  Oil prices plunge after news  WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is considering releasing up to 180 million barrels of oil over several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), four U.S. sources said on Wednesday, as the White House tries to lower fuel prices.  The latest amount of U.S. oil release being considered, which is equivalent to about two days of global demand, would mark the third time the United States has tapped its strategic reserves in the past six months, and would be the largest release in the near 50-year history of the SPR. read more  The International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries are also set to meet on Friday at 1200 GMT to decide on a collective oil release, a spokesperson for New Zealand energy minister said in an email, aimed at calming global crude prices that scaled 14-year highs this month amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The amount of the potential collective release has not been decided," the spokesperson for minister Megan Woods added. "That meeting will set a total volume, and per country allocations will follow," she said. read more  While it was unclear if the U.S. SPR draw would be part of a wider global coordinated release, the news slammed oil markets, pushing prices on both sides of the Atlantic down more than $6 a barrel.  The IEA did not respond to a request for comment outside office hours. President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Thursday on his administration's actions, the White House said.  Oil prices have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and the United States and allies responded with hefty sanctions on Russia - the No.2 exporter of crude.  Russia is among the top three oil producers and accounts for about 14% of the world's total supply.  Sanctions and reluctance to purchase Russian oil could remove about 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil from the market starting in April, the IEA has said.  Russia exports 4 to 5 million bpd.  Supply concerns drove up benchmark Brent crude futures to about $139 a barrel this month, highest since 2008.  News of the potential oil release comes ahead of a meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, an oil producer group known as OPEC+. The United States, Britain and others have previously urged OPEC+ to quickly boost output.  However, OPEC+ is not expected to veer from its plan to keep boosting output gradually when it meets Thursday. read more  The U.S. SPR currently holds 568.3 million barrels, its lowest since May 2002, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  The United States is considered a net petroleum exporter by the IEA. But that status could change to net importer this year and then return to exporter again as output has been slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.  It was not immediately clear whether a 180 million barrel draw would consist of exchanges from the reserve that would have to be replaced by oil companies at a later date, outright sales, or a combination of the two.  The White House did not comment on the plan to release oil.  The oil release would increase supplies by 1 million barrels per day for six months and help market rebalance this year, but it does not resolve the structural supply deficit, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.  POLITICAL LIABILITY FOR BIDEN  The White House said Biden will deliver remarks at 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT) on "his administration's actions to reduce the impact of Putin's price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families."  It did not give additional details.  High gasoline prices are a political liability for Biden and his Democratic Party as they seek to retain control of Congress in November elections.  Given that the United States is taking a "muscular stance toward Moscow, promising more sanctions if Russia continues to wage war in Ukraine, we believe the SPR release is being used as a tool to blunt the impact of these foreign policy decisions for U.S. consumers," RBC Capital said in a note to clients.  U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last week that the United States and its allies in the IEA were discussing a further coordinated release from storage. read more  IEA member states agreed earlier in March to release over 60 million barrels of oil reserves, with 30 million barrels coming from the U.S. SPR.  The Biden administration is also considering temporarily removing curbs on summer sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends as a way to lower fuel costs for U.S. consumers, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. read more  Adding more ethanol to gasoline blends could potentially reduce prices at U.S. gas pumps because ethanol, which is made from corn, is currently cheaper than straight gasoline.

REUTERS/Richard Carson  LONDON/WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Top oil consuming nations may find that one of their main tools to fight high global oil prices – the release of strategic stockpiles - will prove inadequate to soothe markets starved of Russian supply since its invasion of Ukraine.  The 31-member International Energy Agency, representing industrialized nations but not Russia, presided over the fourth coordinated oil release in its history on March 1 of over 60 million barrels of crude – its largest yet.  The United States is considering yet another massive release - of up to 180 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over months - to stave off consumer energy inflation, according to sources. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But the agreements unveiled so far have failed to stop a dizzying climb in oil prices, underscoring the finite power of emergency reserves to address long-term supply problems like those stemming from Russia’s war on Ukraine, strong consumer demand, and capacity constraints in other producer nations to make up the shortfall.  "Historically, SPR releases have temporarily sent oil prices lower and are then followed by higher prices as the market prices in insufficient supply," said Josh Young, chief investment officer at Bison Interests. "It is likely that oil prices rise after an initial temporary pullback, and that the SPR may have to be refilled at even higher prices."  Several consumer countries - including the biggest, the United States - have imposed bans on Russian oil imports since the invasion which Moscow calls a "special operation," tightening global markets already hit by rebounding fuel demand and production limits by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The IEA expects 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil - equivalent to over a third of its exports - to be shut in as sanctions bite and buyers spurn purchases.  Repeated stockpile releases, meanwhile, will further thin the world’s supply cushion. "Each release is likely to have diminishing effect on the oil markets,” said John Paisie, president of Houston-based consultancy Stratas Advisors.  U.S. SPR crude stocks  President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Thursday on his administration's actions, the White House said.  That news pushed oil prices down more than 4% late Wednesday but was also met with skepticism by some analysts.  Washington had also pledged in November to release 50 million barrels of SPR oil in a coordinated move with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, a deal that also failed to stop oil’s climb above $100 a barrel.  State storage across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, most of whose members belong to IEA, hit 1.48 billion barrels late last year, down more than 100 million barrels from a 2017 high.  A Reuters analysis of IEA data shows government-controlled oil stocks among members states was at its lowest since 2005 even before the March 1 release.  U.S. SPR levels have dropped to their lowest since 2002, government data showed.  Reuters Graphics  IT’S NOT WORKING. DO IT AGAIN  Some analysts have called for governments to release even more oil from reserves, with bank JP Morgan suggesting the IEA could commit to release 50 million barrels per month or more for the rest of the year.  Neil Atkinson, an oil analyst and former IEA senior official, said only big releases will be enough to make a difference in a 100 million bpd global oil market.  "This time it will have to be, by comparison, a big bazooka," he said.  But longer-term, the key to rebalancing the market is increased commercial production, not stockpile drawdowns.  “Stocks of strategic oil have a limit and flows of commercial oil do not. Flows that stop are a bigger problem than strategic stocks can solve over time," said Kevin Book, energy policy analyst at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington.  Ramping up production can be slow, however.  A shale boom roughly doubled U.S. oil output since the 2000s, boosting the country to the world's top producer spot. But after oil output fell during the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts the United States will return to being a net importer in 2022 before returning to net exporter status in 2023.  Meanwhile, OPEC and ally producers including Russia, a group known as OPEC+ that cut output after demand slumped due to the pandemic, will likely stick to plans for a modest uptick in production in coming months, according to sources, as the group's kingpin Saudi Arabia continues to reject calls from consumer nations for quicker increases.  Stockpiles have helped with past limited disruptions. The previous release of 60 million barrels coordinated by the IEA amid the Libyan civil war in 2011, slashed prices $10 a barrel to around $105. A prior 60 million-barrel release in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina dropped the price around $3 on the week to $62 a barrel.  Global benchmark Brent futures fell by $4.36, or 3.84%, to $109.09 a barrel at 0103 GMT on news of the potential release, but remained up from just below $97 before the invasion.

REUTERS/Bing Guan  The U.S. oil release could be effective in reducing wild volatility and curtail sharp upward movements, but prices need a long-term solution, said Avtar Sandu, a commodities manager at Phillip Futures.  Oil settled up around 3% on Wednesday as peace talks stalled between Ukraine and Russia, which calls its actions a "special operation".  Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter and Western sanctions imposed as punishment for the invasion have disrupted flows from the country.  In early March the Biden administration said it would sell 30 million barrels from the strategic reserve as part of a global release of 60 million barrels to lower prices.  In November the United States announced a plan to release 50 million barrels from the SPR, mostly through exchanges where the buyer agrees to replace the oil later. read more  "If it turns out to be as much as that, it would be significant and so would certainly help to a certain extent to fill the shortfall, but not all of it," said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, referring to the 180 million barrels figure.  "Another key question is whether this volume would be part of a wider coordinated release. I guess we need to also see if this would be a straightforward release or an exchange."  The release comes after U.S. commercial oil inventories fell by 3.4 million barrels in the week to March 25, surpassing forecasts of a 1 million barrel drop. At the same time, implied demand for gasoline and distillates declined. read more  The slower demand came as U.S. production rose by 100,000 bpd to 11.7 million bpd after stagnating at 11.6 million bpd since early February.

The United States, the world's largest crude producer, is currently pumping out 11.7 million barrels a day, but that is not enough to meet world demand.  The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently stands at 568.3 million barrels. This release would be the largest-ever since the reserve was created in 1974.  It is unclear if other members of the International Energy Agency, which include 29 other nations such as France, Germany and Japan, will follow the United States.

The IEA, along with the United States, said it would release 60 million barrels earlier this month after the Russian invasion.  The United States also periodically releases oil on its own, sometimes through Congressionally legislated sales.  Washington has also released from its strategic reserve through exchange agreements, similar to loans, with private companies, often in the wake of local natural disasters. The companies have to repay by a certain date, with additional premium barrels as interest.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  A look at the day ahead in markets from Saikat Chatterjee.  Whether you are a macro-guru or an astute stock picker, this is a quarter that most investors would like to forget.  Most consensus trades coming into 2022 including long value stocks, yield curve steepeners and buying euros have been crushed. Not only world stocks have witnessed the most gut-wrenching volatility in years, the first three months of the year has fuelled the strongest commodities rally since World War I and the fastest rise in global interest rates in decades.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But as the dust settles on the first quarter, stock markets are slowly finding their feet. U.S. stocks (.SPX) are back to within 5% of the all-time high struck on January 4.  A global stock index will end the quarter down around 4%, its worst performance since the pandemic crash two years ago but well above the 14% year-to-date drop only two weeks ago.  Bond and currencies have fared worse. A Bank of America U.S. Treasuries index is on track for its worst quarterly performance in 25 years while the Japanese yen has declined a whopping 6% in the last three months, a speed of decline only rivaled by the British pound after the Brexit referendum vote. Volatility has soared across asset classes.  But taking the 30,000 feet view above the quarterly market performance, some longer term trends are emerging. Russia's invasion of Ukraine means global supply chains will remain under pressure for the forseeable future and global policymakers will struggle to control rampant inflation without choking growth.  For now, markets are taking the optimistic view. U.S. and European stock futures are higher and oil prices lower on signs the Biden administration is considering a massive release of crude oil from U.S. reserves to combat inflation. read more  However, a slide in Chinese stocks as output data reflect the damage of renewed lockdowns in technology and factory hubs weighed on Asian markets. Treasuries added to price gains, while a portion of the curve has pulled out of a brief inversion that raised concerns about an impending recession.

REUTERS/Matthew Childs  Summary  Summary Companies Cost of growing a cucumber to jump from 25p to 70p  High energy costs mean crops not planted  Pressures likely to push food prices higher  ROYDON, England, March 31 (Reuters) - In a small corner of south-east England, vast glasshouses stand empty, the soaring cost of energy preventing their owner from using heat to grow cucumbers for the British market.  Elsewhere in the country growers have also failed to plant peppers, aubergines and tomatoes after a surge in natural gas prices late last year was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making the crops economically unviable.  The hit to UK farms, which need gas to counter the country's inclement weather, is one of the myriad ways the energy crisis and invasion have hit food supplies around the world, with global grain production and edible oils also under threat.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In Britain it is likely to push food prices higher at a time of historic inflation, and threaten the availability of goods such as the quintessentially British cucumber sandwich served at the Wimbledon tennis tournament and big London hotels.  While last year it cost about 25 pence to produce a cucumber in Britain, that has now doubled and is set to hit 70 pence when higher energy prices fully kick in, trade body British Growers says.  Regular sized cucumbers were selling for as little as 43 pence at Britain's biggest supermarket chains on Tuesday.  "Gas prices being so sky high, it's a worrying time," grower Tony Montalbano told Reuters, while standing in an empty glasshouse at Roydon in the Lea Valley where for 54 years three generations of his family have farmed cucumbers.  "All the years of us working hard to get to where we are, and then one year it could just all finish," he said.  All 30,000 square metres of glasshouse at his Green Acre Salads business, which supplies supermarket groups including market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and Morrisons, are currently empty.  Montalbano, whose grandfather emigrated from Sicily in 1968 and started a nursery to provide local stores with fresh cucumbers, decided not to plant the first of the year's three cycles in January.  SOARING COSTS  Last year he paid 40-50 pence a therm for natural gas. Last week it was 2.25 pounds a therm, having briefly hit a record 8 pounds in the wake of Russia's invasion.  Fertiliser prices have tripled versus last year, while the cost of carbon dioxide - used both to aid growing and in packaging - and hard-to-attain labour have also shot up.  "We are now in an unprecedented situation where the cost increases have far outstripped a grower's ability to do anything about them," said Jack Ward, head of British Growers.  It means a massive contraction for the industry, threatening Britain's future food security, and further price rises for UK consumers already facing a bigger inflation hit than other countries in Europe following Brexit.  UK inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and is forecast to approach 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.  The National Farmers' Union says the UK is sleepwalking into a food security crisis. It warns that UK production of peppers could fall from 100 million last year to 50 million this year, with cucumbers down from 80 million to 35 million.  In winter, the UK has typically imported around 90% of crops like cucumbers and tomatoes, but has been nearly self-sufficient in the summer.  The Lea Valley Growers Association, whose members produce about three-quarters of Britain's cucumber and sweet pepper crop, said about 90% did not plant in January, while half have still not planted and will not plant if gas prices remain high.  "There's definitely going to be a lack of British produce in the supermarkets," association secretary Lee Stiles said. "Whether there's a lack of produce overall depends on where and how far away the retailers are prepared to source it from."  Growers in the Netherlands, one of Britain's key salad suppliers, face similar challenges and have reduced exports.  Spain and Morocco do not heat their glasshouses to a large extent, but delivery to the UK in chilled lorries adds time and cost.  Joe Shepherdson of the UK's Cucumber Growers Association said those growers that have planted are using less heat, but that reduces production and increases the risk of disease.  PRESSURE ON PRICES  Britain's biggest supermarket groups, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), acknowledge the pressures in the market but say they are confident about supply, stressing their long-term partnerships with growers.  How far the increase in production costs will translate to higher prices on the shelf depends largely on whether supermarkets opt to absorb the difference themselves, or pass it on to consumers.  Smaller retailers buying from the market may struggle.  "Any cut in production from suppliers would undoubtedly put further pressure on prices," said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at retail industry lobby group the British Retail Consortium.  Growers want help from the government. They have lobbied for tax and levies on gas to be removed, but finance minister Rishi Sunak did not mention it in his spring budget last week.  Despite the dismal backdrop and after much soul-searching, Montalbano will plant a crop next month, fearing the loss of future contracts if he does not. He may gamble on the British weather, and grow his plants "cold", with little or no heat.  "I feel like I have no choice, because if I don't, then I lose my place," he said, in a glasshouse that in a normal March would be packed with bushy green cucumber plants.  "Am I going to make anything out of it? I'll be quite happy to break even this year," he said.

REUTERS/Neil Hall  Summary GDP +1.3% q/q in Q4 vs preliminary +1.0%  Health drove growth as COVID cases mounted  Household incomes hit as inflation rose  Current account deficit narrows  LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew more quickly than previously thought in late 2021 but the increase was largely due to COVID-related activity in the health sector, which masked the inflation hit to household incomes and a gloomy picture for the private sector.  Gross domestic product in the world's fifth-biggest economy increased by 1.3% in the fourth quarter, when the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases mounted, official data showed on Thursday.  That was stronger than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.0% from the previous three-month period.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But the largest contributors to the increase came from health and social work including more visits to doctors, a large increase in coronavirus testing and tracing and an extension of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.  Paul Dales, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the upward revision to GDP was not as encouraging as it looked at first glance.  "A lot of it appears to be due to inventories while consumer spending was revised down," he said. "The latter suggests the squeeze on real incomes is starting to bite, although the fall in the saving rate is providing a cushion."  Households dipped into their lockdown savings to finance their spending. The saving ratio fell to 6.8% of disposable income from 7.5% in third second quarter, heading back towards its level of 6.0% immediately before the pandemic.  Last week, finance minister Rishi Sunak announced tax cuts to help soften the hit to consumers from surging energy prices which have risen further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. read more  While fourth-quartergrowth pick-up represented an acceleration from the economy's 0.9% expansion in the third quarter, it was well below its 5.6% expansion in the April-June period when it was rebounding from COVID-19 lockdowns.  HOUSEHOLDS HIT  Investors expect the recovery to slow in 2022 as inflation heads for almost 9% and households face the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s, according to forecasts by the government's fiscal watchdog.  Thursday's data showed household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.2% in the July-September period, revised down from an originally reported 0.5% increase, and it fell again by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.  The dip in the third quarter reflected the increased impact of inflation on household budgets and a downward revision of pension contributions, the Office for National Statistics said.  Household incomes as a share of all income in Britain's economy, which includes business and government income, fell to 72.2%, its lowest since records began in 1987.  Real household disposable spending in the fourth quarter rose by 0.5%, weaker than an original estimate of 1.2% growth.  Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed companies were also struggling.  White Britain's economic output at the end of 2021 was only 0.1% below where it was at the end of 2019, excluding government expenditure and investment it was 2.9% below its pre-pandemic level, he said.  Britain's balance of payments deficit in the fourth quarter narrowed to 7.3 billion pounds ($9.59 billion), helped by the first surplus since 2011 in the balance of British investment income abroad and foreign investment income in the country.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected a deficit of 17.6 billion pounds.  The ONS said the investment account surplus was driven by higher income from British assets in the oil sector abroad and a change in the schedule of dividend payments at home.  As a share of GDP, the overall current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% from 4.9% in the third quarter.

REUTERS//File Photo  LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Russia has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder and Moscow's threats to cut Europe's gas supply seems to be upping the ante further.  Would a default really make any difference at this stage though, and what would it entail?  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COUNTRY DEFAULTS?  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default.  Such an event would have been unthinkable before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a "special military operation", and subsequent sanctions that have frozen hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its reserves.  Russia is already locked out of the international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, but a default would mean it couldn't regain access until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.  Defaults in other countries such as Argentina have seen aggressive creditors go after physical assets such as a navy vessel and the country's presidential aircraft. Russia's state-owned energy giants own some of Europe's key gas infrastructure so it would raise plenty of questions.  It could also create a host of headaches if countries or companies that would normally trade with Russia have self-imposed rules that prohibit transacting with an entity in default.  If sanctions are removed at some point in the future Russia's reputation in financial markets would still be tarnished. That would depress Russia's credit ratings and push up the borrowing rates paid by the Russian government and companies.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?  By continuing to make its debt payments this month, Russia so far has swerved its first default of any kind since a 1998 financial crisis, and its first on the international market debt since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution when the new government refused to recognise Tsar-era borrowings.  This week Moscow has upped the stakes by offering to make a $2 billion bond payment due next week - its biggest of the year - in roubles rather than the intended dollars. read more  As long as Russia doesn't force anyone who doesn't want roubles to take them, it wouldn't usually count as a default, but it is walking a tightrope. That the main rating agencies have had to withdraw their Russia ratings, and therefore won't call a default whatever happens, complicates things.  THE NEXT TEST  Another $447 million international bond payment is due on Thursday , but even if Russia remains willing to pay complications are about to stack up.  Western sanctions ban transactions with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund, although the temporary general license 9A issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on March 2 makes an exception for the purposes of "the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity."  That license expires on May 25, however, after which Russia will have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.  Analysts say after next Monday's $2 billion payment, the next crucial test will come on May 27 - the first payment due after the current OFAC licence expires.  Russia could be forced to make the payment in roubles, and into bank accounts in Russia, which the finance ministry has said would be its fallback option.  That would constitute a default, however, as the legal terms of that bond state it must be paid back in dollars.  Russia has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo  Summary  Summary Companies Western countries brace for potential rise in cyber attacks  Terror clauses more narrowly defined than war  Policyholders may still be able to claim  "Silent cyber" in other policies may also lead to claims  Premiums doubled last year, more rises seen  LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - Insurers face potential multi-billion dollar claims for cyber attacks related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite policy wording designed to get them off the hook for war, industry sources say.  Following the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine and Western sanctions against Moscow, the U.S. government said last week it had seen "preparatory" Russian hacking activity aimed at numerous U.S. companies, though it said it had "no certainty" such an attack would occur. read more  Western financial regulators have already warned banks of the risks of cyber attacks though none have been confirmed so far. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  European and U.S. insurers, already facing mounting losses in the past year, have been driving up premiums due to the increased coverage cost and prevalence of so-called ransomware attacks.  If Russia carries out a large cyber attack which spills over into several countries, it could lead to claims totalling $20 billion or more, similar to insurance claims from a large U.S. hurricane, the industry sources said on condition of anonymity.  This comes as insurers also face losses related to the conflict in other business sectors such as aviation, which is seen as particularly exposed to the impact of what Russia calls a "special military operation" to disarm Ukraine. read more  Lloyd's of London, one of the world's biggest players in cyber and other commercial insurance policies, said last week that it faced "major" claims from the invasion. read more .  Cyber insurance - whose market ratings agency Fitch says totalled over $2.7 billion in 2020 in the United States alone - covers a business for the repair of hacked networks, business interruption losses and also cyber ransom payments.  Such policies do not cover war, or attacks by so-called "state-sponsored actors".  It is often hard, however, to identify the perpetrator of a cyber attack.  "Defining what is state-sponsored is quite challenging," Lloyd's of London chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters last week. "These policies get tested by new events and we need to work through the wording...and make sure our customers understand where they are covered and where they aren't."  AMBIGUITIES  Even if insurers can prove a cyber attack was a result of the conflict in Ukraine, war exclusions may not be enough to protect them.  Cyber insurers have become more aware of ambiguities in their insurance in recent years, but some are slower to adapt than others.  Policy wordings vary from insurer to insurer, and are open to interpretation, said Marcos Alvarez, head of insurance at ratings agency DBRS Morningstar.  This is expected to lead to disagreements between insurers and policyholders about whether or not there is coverage, similar to business interruption insurance cases which have gone to court across the world since the outbreak of COVID-19. read more  A particular grey area is over cyber terror attacks, which are generally covered by insurance.  Terror is typically more narrowly defined than war, but Westlaw, a Thomson Reuters company, said in a note last week that "cyber terrorism" is sometimes defined "quite broadly to include any attack against a computer system with the 'intent to cause harm' in furtherance of 'social, ideological, religious, economic or political objectives'".  Policyholders could end up being covered "quite expansively" by cyber or cyber terrorism policies, said Yosha DeLong, global head of cyber at insurer Mosaic.  "Any time there's ambiguous wording on a policy, it's to the client's advantage, not the insurer's."  There is also a risk from "silent cyber", in which businesses have other policies which do not specifically exclude cyber attacks, and may look to claim on those.  A New Jersey court ruled in January in favour of Merck & Co (MRK.N) over a $1.4 billion insurance claim for the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, which the White House blamed on Russia.  To reduce their overall risk, some cyber insurers are considering broad exclusions for Russia and Ukraine, said Meredith Schnur, U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader at broker Marsh.  CHANGING TACTICS  Military losses could lead to a different approach by Russia, including cyber attacks, analysts at Eurasia said.  Some Russian units suffering heavy losses had been forced to return home and to neighbouring Belarus, British military intelligence said this week, after Russia promised to scale down military operations around Kyiv. read more  Cyber attacks have taken place on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, government services, banks and telecoms, analytics firm CyberCube said in a report earlier this month.  Russian government institutions and businesses are also being targeted by cyber attackers, CyberCube said, adding that some attacks have spilled over into Belarus, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.  The invasion is also adding to pressure on cyber insurance premiums, with rates rising sharply due to ransomeware attacks where hackers encrypt victims' data and demand a ransom to release it.  Cyber security firm Coveware likened the 90%-plus profit margin from ransomware attacks last year to the gains Colombian cocaine cartels made in 1992. read more  Cyber insurance rates rose by 130% in the United States and by 92% in Britain in the fourth quarter, according to Marsh.  Industry sources see similar rate rises this year.  Rate rises already vary wildly, one consultant said, giving an example of a small business in Britain which had seen its annual cyber insurance premium leap to 450,000 pounds ($590,940.00) from 80,000 pounds.  "Everyone's prices have gone up, now they will go up even more," the consultant said.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Pool/File Photo  LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - The head of Britain's GCHQ spy service said on Wednesday that new intelligence showed some Russian soldiers in Ukraine had refused to carry out orders, sabotaged their own equipment and accidentally shot down one of their own aircraft.  Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States. read more  Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said President Vladimir Putin had "massively misjudged" the capabilities of Russia's once mighty armed forces while underestimating both the resistance of the Ukrainian people and the resolve of the West, which has punished Moscow with largely coordinated sanctions.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Putin has massively misjudged the situation," Fleming said in a speech in Canberra at the Australian National University, according to a transcript of his remarks. "We believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth."  Citing new intelligence, Fleming said there was evidence that Russian soldiers had low morale and were poorly equipped.  "We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft," Fleming said.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm GCHQ's analysis.  GCHQ, which gathers communications from around the world to identify and disrupt threats to Britain, has a close relationship with the U.S. National Security Agency and with the eavesdropping agencies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a consortium called "Five Eyes".  Russia's defence ministry says its armed forces are professional and carrying out their duty in Ukraine with considerable success. It says the West has spread lies about the operation in an attempt to bring down Russia.  The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60% for some of its precision-guided missiles, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters. read more  Putin was misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Western sanctions have been, U.S. and European officials said on Wednesday. read more The Kremlin made no immediate comment.  Putin says the "special military operation" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine.  Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense.  Russia says that the West has effectively declared economic war on Russia and so it will now turn eastwards, away from Europe and build a partnership with China.  "But there are risks to them both (and more for China) in being too closely aligned," Fleming said.  "Russia understands that long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation."

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. - RC2KCT9KNJS0  SYDNEY, March 31 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Australia's parliament on Thursday that Russia must be held accountable for past wrongs, warning that a failure to punish Moscow may encourage other countries to wage war against their neighbours.  Zelenskiy called for new and tougher sanctions to retaliate against Russia's invasion of Ukraine and suggested that years of failure to rein in the global power had emboldened Moscow.  "If we don't stop Russia now, if we don't hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to a similar war against their neighbours will decide that such things are possible for them as well," Zelenskiy said in the video address, according to an official translation.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Zelenskiy, seated at a desk wearing his trademark khaki t-shirt, did not specify which countries he feared would be inspired by Russia.  Australia and its Western allies have raised concerns about increasingly aggressive language by China regarding Taiwan, whose independence it disputes.  "The fate of the global security is decided now," Zelenskiy said. "No one can manage to win … no one can save any part of the world from radioactive (destruction) that were to come if nuclear weapons are used," he said.  Western countries say Moscow's invasion, the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two, was entirely unprovoked. Russia says it is carrying out a "special operation" to disarm and "denazify" its neighbour. read more  Australia has supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, while banning exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia. read more  It has sanctioned 443 individuals, including businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 33 entities, including most of Russia's banking sector and all entities responsible for the country's sovereign debt. read more  On Thursday, Australia said it was imposing an additional 35% tariff on imports from Russia and Belarus, which it said supported the invasion, and that it was increasing its military assistance to Ukraine by A$25 million to A$116 million ($86.70 million).  Zelenskiy invoked the worst clash between Australia and Russia in recent years, the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in 2014 by what investigators say was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 on board including 38 Australians. read more  "Has Russia paid compensation to the dead and families? No, they are still denying the fault of this tragedy," he said.  He also brought up the Russian invasion of Crimea that same year. "If the world had punished Russia in 2014 for what it did, there would not be any of this terror invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We have to correct such horrible mistakes and correct them now."  The Ukrainian leader did not spell out which additional sanctions he wanted imposed on Russia but said its leadership was using the threat of nuclear attack to limit the global response to its invasion.  "The country which is using the nuclear blackmailing should receive the sanctions which should show that such blackmailing is destructive for the blackmailer itself," he said.

Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of its southern neighbor has been halted on many fronts by stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces who have recaptured territory even as civilians are trapped in besieged cities.  “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,” Kate Bedingfield, White House communications director, told reporters during a press briefing.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisors are too afraid to tell him the truth,” she said.  The U.S. was putting forward this information now to show “this has been a strategic error for Russia,” she said.  The Kremlin made no immediate comment about the assertions after the end of the working day in Moscow, and the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Washington's decision to share its intelligence more publicly reflects a strategy it has pursued since before the war began. In this case, it could also complicate Putin's calculations, a second U.S. official said, adding, "It's potentially useful. Does it sow dissension in the ranks? It could make Putin reconsider whom he can trust."

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS/File Photo  One senior European diplomat said the U.S. assessment was in line with European thinking. "Putin thought things were going better than they were. That's the problem with surrounding yourself with 'yes men' or only sitting with them at the end of a very long table," the diplomat said.  Russian conscripts were told they were taking part in military exercises, but had to sign a document before the invasion that extended their duties, two European diplomats said.  "They were misled, badly trained and then arrived to find old Ukrainian women who looked like their grandmothers yelling at them to go home," one of the diplomats added.  There were no indications at the moment that the situation could foster a revolt among the Russian military, but the situation was "unpredictable" and Western powers "would hope that unhappy people would speak up," the senior European diplomat said.  Military analysts say Russia has reframed its war goals in Ukraine in a way that may make it easier for Putin to claim a face-saving victory despite a woeful campaign in which his army has suffered humiliating setbacks. read more  Russian forces bombarded the outskirts of the capital Kyiv and the besieged city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine on Wednesday, a day after Russia promised to scale down military operations in both cities in what the West dismissed as a ploy to regroup by invaders suffering heavy losses. read more  Russia says it is carrying out a "special operation" to disarm and "denazify" its neighbor.

Now recovering in the relative safety of a childrens' hospital in Zaporizhzhia, some 200 km (124 miles) away, she recounts the incident calmly, a bright green line on the side of her face and neck marking the area where doctors have treated her wounds.  "I saw darkness and there was a loud noise ringing in my ears," she said. "When I opened my eyes, I saw my mother holding me in her arms. She put me on the ground and started crying and asking for help."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  According to Yelena, Milena was wounded when Russian troops opened fire as the family passed through a checkpoint on the way to Zaporizhzhia, an industrial town that has become a key transit point for evacuees fleeing from Mariupol.  Busloads of evacuees arrive in the city before moving further west, joining an exodus where around a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people have had to leave their homes to seek refuge either in safer areas of the country or abroad.  Next to Milena, Sasha, an 11-year-old boy, also from Mariupol, sits with a large white bandage on his nose, the legacy of a rocket strike that hit as he was playing with friends. "I was very afraid, there was a lot of blood everywhere," he said.  Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, has become a symbol of suffering more than a month after Russia invaded its smaller neighbour in what the Kremlin calls its assault a "special operation" to disarm and "denazify" Ukraine.  According to city authorities in Mariupol, nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed since the Russian assault began.  1/5 Two 11-year-old kids, Milana and Sasha, who were wounded during the shelling of Mariupol, sit in a bed in the children's ward of the hospital, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, March 29, 2022. REUTERS/Marko Djurica Read More  Russia denies its forces target civilians but local authorities say at least 80% of the city has been destroyed and United Nations agencies have warned of "extremely dire" conditions in Mariupol and other cities.  Evacuees who make it into Zaporizhzhia, usually after an arduous and dangerous journey by car or bus, recount a ruined wasteland of rubble without power or heating, where people cook on open fires and drink rainwater or melted snow.  "Mariupol is gone, it's bombed out," said Katia Semeniuk, 77, sitting in a crowded supermarket that has been converted into a reception centre where the evacuees are offered food, warm clothing and assistance.  A noticeboard is covered in handwritten messages with appeals for help finding lost relatives or offers of help with travel. Volunteers help with administration and coordinate personal details of people with lost documents.  Semeniuk arrived in Zaporizhzhia after weeks spent moving from shelter to shelter in Mariupol, where she had taken refuge with her son after being bombed out of her own house in a village outside the town.  "There was a house, we had everything, and now there is nothing left," she said.  For many of those who have escaped, the future is uncertain as no one can tell how long the fighting will last.  But Milena, a keen gymnast, has some ideas. With their city in ruins, the family is heading for neighbouring Lithuania, far to the west.  "I have a dream that when we get to Lithuania, we will find a gym and I can train again," she said.

Picture taken March 27, 2022 REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis  LVIV, Ukraine, March 30 (Reuters) - On a warm March day that has all the signs of early spring, three burly men lift their shovels from a truck and begin covering a row of fresh graves with sand.  Stefan Ivanchuk, a 60-year-old groundskeeper at Lychakiv cemetery in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, is already sweating as he bends to his work among the graves, where blue and yellow ribbons, the colours of Ukraine, adorn simple wooden crosses.  It's not normally Ivanchuk's job to dig graves but since the start of the war with Russia all of the cemetery workers, even the security guard, have been asked to help out as more young Ukrainians die at the front and return home in coffins.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The hardest thing is to bury young men," Ivanchuk says as he leans against his shovel. The youngest soldier they buried here was just 20-years-old.  "It just hurts your soul," he says.  The 21 new graves sit in a special corner of the cemetery reserved for Ukraine's war heroes.  A worker wearing a dark sweater wipes the sweat from his face and walks back to the white truck to get more sand, which absorbs moisture and helps keep the earth flat.  After a year, workers will cover the ground and build tombstones like the dozens of rows of identical stone crosses that already mark the graves of soldiers who have died in the eight years since Russian forces annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists seized pockets of Ukraine’s eastern region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has since recognised the regions as independent states, though the rest of the world considers them part of Ukraine.  Until recently, Lychakiv cemetery was one of Lviv's major tourist attractions. Ivan Franko, a poet and national hero, is buried here, as are many notable Poles who lived in the city during the years it oscillated between Polish and Soviet control.  Tourists have now all but disappeared from the 18th Century cemetery. Lviv, which sits just 80 kilometres from the Polish border, has so far been spared the sort of devastating attacks seen in eastern Ukrainian cities since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. Mariupol and Kharkiv have been heavily shelled. Civilian casualties are thought to be in the thousands and the United Nations estimates some 3.9 million people have fled.  In Lviv, young women with tiny dogs on leashes sip cappuccino outdoors, while buskers perform cover songs on the busy promenade in front of the city's opera house.  The now twice weekly funerals of soldiers, which take place at the Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul in the centre of the city, are one of the few reminders of war.  On Sunday, mourners knelt on the cold marble floor as soldiers in camouflage carried two caskets into the hall of the garrison church. Standing under statues of winged angels and saints shrouded in blue and white sheets to protect them from bombs, a priest told the crowd of mourners their men were now with God.  "From heaven they will do everything possible to remain side by side with their brothers in arms, their families and kin," the priest said.  "Our love for them is not in the past, our love for them is ongoing."  The women sobbed and men carrying blue and yellow tulips looked down at their feet.  Later, at Lychakiv cemetery, workers lower yet another casket into the ground. The dirt makes a dull thudding sound every time it hits the wooden crown of the coffin.  Ivanchuk, the groundskeeper, explains that to dig each grave requires four workers. With four or five funerals taking place at one time the workers have had to abandon their normal duties.  "All the staff came to dig the graves, even security and the person who sells tickets (to the museum on the grounds)," he says.  Down the street from the cemetery, Liliya, 45, works as a manager of a warehouse that supplies simple caskets and flowers to the military for local soldiers' funerals. "It's so difficult to know that these are such young soldiers," she says, declining to give her last name. "I am scared every day but I continue to believe that we will win."  On March 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said around 1,300 Ukrainian military personnel had so far died in the conflict. Moscow, on the other hand, has said that 1,351 Russian soldiers have been killed in what Putin says is a "special military operation." Ukraine and the United States estimate Russian military casualties to be far higher than official announcements.  Ivanchuk, who previously worked as a truck driver in Germany, says his son has been driving off to cities across Ukraine to evacuate women and children to Lviv.  The city's population - originally 720,000 – has ballooned by nearly 200,000 since war broke out. The streets are packed with crowds of newly arrived Ukrainian families. The narrow roads of the historic city are jammed with cars carrying plates from Kyiv and Kharkiv.  "All anyone wants to say to foreign governments is to close the sky (over Ukraine), but I know they are afraid to join the war," Ivanchuk says. Ukraine has repeatedly called on Western allies to create a no-fly zone above the country to prevent further Russian aerial assaults.  In that moment an elderly woman walks by the graves and pauses in front of one of the newer crosses.  Ivanchuk picks up his shovel. Next week, workers will need to dig four new graves. Their truck now empty of sand, the crew throw in their gear and start up the engine.

The flare-up of violence in Afar this year came after fighting in the neighbouring regions of Tigray and Amhara had ground to a stalemate and as moves were gathering pace to get the government in Addis Ababa and Tigrayan rebels to agree to peace negotiations.  "There cannot be peace in Ethiopia while there is fighting in Afar," said Mussa Ibrahim, a clan leader in Erepti, one of six districts in Afar currently occupied by Tigrayan forces.  Tahir Darsa, 8, receives treatment after sustaining third degree burns caused by explosives. On Thursday, Ethiopia announced a unilateral ceasefire, the second to be called in a 16-month conflict that has displaced millions of people and plunged hundreds of thousands into famine conditions. But Afar police commissioner Ahmed Harif told Reuters on Monday that fighting was ongoing in two of the six districts occupied by Tigrayan fighters, and there was a "significant" buildup of Tigrayan forces along the border. Two humanitarian workers confirmed the fighting. Getachew Reda, a spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which is battling the government, denied there were clashes in those areas. He did not comment on accusations of a military buildup.  Mussa Ibrahim speaks to Reuters. The TPLF previously said it would observe the ceasefire if aid was speedily delivered. The last time the government declared a unilateral ceasefire in July, following months of battles that forced the military out of Tigray, the TPLF dismissed it as a "joke" and continued fighting, saying key conditions for peace had not been met. The TPLF and Afar forces dispute who started the most recent round of fighting in the northeastern region, which flared up in mid-January. The regional government estimates 300,000 people have had to abandon their homes. The TPLF says they were responding to attacks on Tigray by Afar forces and allies, while Afar officials say Tigrayan forces were the aggressors.  A severely malnourished child drinks from a bottle at a camp for internally displaced people. Among those who fled the violence was Ayisha Ali, whose home town of Berhale came under attack in early February. Speaking at a warehouse that serves as a rudimentary camp for the displaced in Afdera, some 130 km to the southeast of her home, she did not know what had happened to her seven children, after her family scattered amid the chaos. Twelve other relatives were killed when their huts were struck by explosions, she said. Among them were her sister, her sister's five children and a pregnant cousin. Ayisha blamed Tigrayan forces. "We couldn't even bury them; their bodies were in pieces," she told Reuters. "The heavy weapons were firing at us, and we ... ran away."  Ayisha Ali sits near her shelter at a makeshift camp for internally displaced people. Two neighbours, speaking at the camp, also described heavy fighting and civilian deaths. Reuters could not independently verify Ayisha's or her neighbours' accounts. Getachew, the TPLF spokesman, did not respond to questions about the killing of civilians in Berhale and elsewhere in Afar. The group has previously denied targeting civilians. TRADING BLAME Tigrayan forces first entered Afar and the adjacent region of Amhara in July. At the time, the TPLF said it was trying to break a stranglehold blocking aid convoys from entering the region and to force Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Amhara allies to withdraw from a contested area in western Tigray. A government offensive in December pushed Tigrayan forces back into their region.  Eysa Mohammed, 15, sits at home with her mother Asiya Mohammed, 40, after sustaining injuries to her right leg from explosives. This time around the warring parties dispute who initiated the violence, and the motives for it are less clear. Ayisha described Tigrayan fighters arriving in Berhale on Feb. 7, sparking fierce gun battles with local militiamen involving heavy weaponry. An internal United Nations security bulletin seen by Reuters said there was still fighting around the town on March 11-12.s.  Ali Asyalo, 14, receives treatment after losing his right leg from explosives. The TPLF accuses Afar forces of attacking the Tigray region along with fighters from Eritrea, Ethiopia's northern neighbour, which is also allied to Abiy's government. Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not respond to requests for comment on the TPLF accusations. In the early months of the war the country denied its forces were fighting in Tigray. Afar regional officials, security forces and allied militiamen point the finger at the TPLF for opening a new front in the conflict. "We don't know why they are invading us, why they are killing our women and children," said Mohammed Idris, head of Afar's northern administrative zone. "We keep defending ourselves, as this is our land."  A relative visits Teha Ahmed, 16, a civilian who was injured during fighting. Ethiopian government spokesman Legesse Tulu and military spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane did not respond to requests for comment about the fighting. Mohammed Hussein, head of the government's humanitarian aid office in Afar, said Tigrayan fighters returned to Afar in mid-January and now hold six out of the region's 32 counties. Getachew did not respond to questions about Tigrayan forces' incursion. The TPLF has accused Addis Ababa of stoking the conflict in Afar to justify blocking aid destined for Tigray, where more than 90% of the population needs food assistance. Ethiopia's government denies blocking aid and blames the fighting in Afar for cutting off the only route humanitarian convoys can take into Tigray.  Dawud Ali, 8, sleeps next to his uncle, Mohammed Ali, 40, after losing fingers from explosives. The disputes underline how complicated it will be to end a war that has threatened the unity of Africa's second-most populous nation. The TPLF, which dominated Ethiopia's government for nearly three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, accuses him of trying to centralise power at the expense of the country's ethnically based regions. Abiy's government says the TPLF is trying to take back control of the country. CIVILIANS KILLED After Ayisha was separated from her children, who are aged between five and 18, she fled.  Amina Mohammed, 60, poses for a photograph in a makeshift camp for internally displaced people. She said she and half a dozen other villagers walked eight days across the desert, begging passing herders for food and water. Two pregnant women who set off with them became too weak to continue. She does not know what happened to them. Ayisha's neighbour, Mohammed Mohamouda, said badly wounded people had been left behind in Berhale. "There were many dead bodies. There was blood and body parts," he said in an interview at the Afdera camp, where families lined up waiting for water. At least 749 civilians have died in fighting in Afar and Amhara since July last year, including extrajudicial killings by all sides involved in the conflict, the government-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said on March 11.  Filimon Gebremedhin, 18, a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front and prisoner of war, sits in a guarded hospital room. On a trip to Afar in late February, Reuters saw two refugee camps overflowing with desperate families. Malnutrition is also rising in the region, said the U.N. World Food Programme, and Afdera's camps are short of water, shelter and food. Still people flood in. Mohammed Hussein at the Afar aid office said the region was being overlooked by international aid groups. "We need food, emergency shelter, water," he said. "The international humanitarian community ... has very little awareness or understanding about the Afar situation."  A mother feeds her severely malnourished child at a camp for internally displaced people. The U.N.'s humanitarian arm OCHA said aid cannot reach some areas of the region due to fighting, and the whole effort is hampered by a lack of funds, supplies and partners. A fifth of health facilities across Afar are not functional, OCHA said in a Feb. 24 report, because they are inaccessible or have been looted or destroyed. Doctors at Dubti Referral Hospital, the region's biggest located around 150 km south of Afdera, told Reuters it was running out of drugs and space as wounded and malnourished patients arrive.  Story The hospital's chief executive officer Mohammed Yusuf said that around 300 people injured in the violence, including women and children, had arrived since January. Cases of children wounded by unexploded ordnance or landmines have jumped from none to around 25 cases per week for the past two months, according to Tamer Ibrahim, head nurse for the surgical unit. Reuters saw medical records for 22 of these cases. (Photo Editing: Gabrielle Fonseca Johnson;Text Editing: Katharine Houreld, Alexandra Zavis, Mike Collet-White; Layout: Kezia Levitas)

Roughly 21.7 million U.S. households use food stamps, which are mostly restricted payments to cold food items, non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants.  Target disclosed to Reuters last week that it will begin to accept payment online with food stamps, tentatively starting in late April, through a service offered by Shipt, its delivery arm.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Offering food-stamp payment for online orders could help Target fill a long-time gap in its e-commerce strategy and reach households that might otherwise purchase groceries at so-called "dollar store" chains, or at Walmart Inc (WMT.N).  Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) already accept purchases with food stamps on their websites since 2019 as part of a program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which distributes food stamps. Grocery delivery service Instacart also offers the option.  Still, even though Target has lost the early mover advantage, investors and industry watchers were positive on the move. Accepting food-stamp payments online could build customer loyalty and help it sell other products, said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds over $30 million in Target shares.  "Target is kind of taking the long view, saying you can use your food stamps now," he said. "But maybe at some point you won't depend on food stamps and you'll remember that Target was there for your various shopping needs."  "I wouldn't call it a game-changer, but I think it is important," Klink added.  Grocery is a big part of Target's operations. In 2020, it accounted for 20% of its overall sales of $92.4 billion, putting it in competition with the 10 largest U.S. grocers, including Kroger (KR.N) and Albertsons (ACI.N). The company this month said it was looking to expand grocery sales, especially through private label.  On March 1, Richard Gomez, Target's chief food and beverage officer, told investors Target is "going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries."  Target's house brand, Good & Gather, now offers nearly 2,500 food and beverage products. Target, for example, sells a 12-ounce can of Good & Gather evaporated milk for $0.99 on its website, compared to Nestle's Carnation condensed milk for $1.69.  "Target will put a leading national brand like Nestle on a display, but put the Target (private-label) item right next to it, to get the consumer to cross over," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm, adding that the move was "transformative."  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in October began providing about 42.8 million people with an additional $20 billion in food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than 3.2 million food-stamp households shopped online in January, doubling from a year before. To buy groceries online, food-stamp recipients generally must have an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card, similar to a debit card. However card holders can't use the benefits to pay for non-food items.  For Target, one question is whether food-stamp recipients will be willing to pay delivery fees. Shipt, which Target acquired in 2017, charges $7 per delivery but offers free same-day delivery to subscribers who pay $99 per year.  Instacart, which handles deliveries for BJ's Wholesale Club, Food Lion, Publix and Ahold Delhaize USA, among others, is waiving its $3.99 delivery fees for food stamp purchases made online until March 31.  Amazon has since offered additional discounts of up to 15%on select meat, produce, toiletries and paper products purchased at Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods by food stamp recipients using EBT cards.  EBT cards can not be used to pay for Amazon Prime subscription membership, tips or items sold by third-party sellers; however, Amazon offers membership discounts of $6.99 per month for customers who are on government programs including SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid. An Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month, or $139 per year.  Lower-income households are seeing their purchasing power erode as meat and bread prices, and heating and gas costs, rise. The price of groceries purchased online in the United States rose 7.6% on average in February, compared to a year earlier, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index.  The $50 billion or more that Americans spend annually on groceries purchased with food stamps represents just 5% of the $1 trillion spent on food-at-home yearly, said Bill Kirk, consumer analyst at MKM Partners.  Still, Target's new payment option underscores its ambition to boost market share in the area of groceries, a category where strong growth in volume sales is hard to come by and where inflation is particularly acute.

REUTERS/Annabelle Chih/File Photo  TAIPEI, March 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's defence ministry has set up a working group to study the tactics of the war in Ukraine, including how the country has been able to hold out against Russia, and has been discussing this with the United States, its minister said on Thursday.  Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has raised its alert level since the Russian invasion, wary of Beijing possibly making a similar move on the island, though it has reported no signs this is about to happen.  The possible impact of the war on China's military thinking on Taiwan, and how China could attack the island, has been widely debated in official circles in Taipei. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of parliament, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said they had had "contact" with foreign countries to talk about how the war was being fought, and had set up their own working group to study it.  Topics Taiwan is following include Russia's poor military performance and Ukraine's resistance, he said.  "It is not only discussed in exchange meetings between the United States and Taiwan, but also discussed with other countries that have regular contacts with Taiwan," Chiu added, without giving details.  Taiwan's team on Ukraine includes academics from the National Defence University, he said.  "However, we will not make remarks rashly, but through internal discussions which are important, to get results that are helpful for building armaments and preparing for war."  While Taiwanese officials have seen many parallels in the Ukraine war and their own situation, including having their own giant neighbour with territorial ambitions, they have also pointed to major differences.  Taiwan has talked, for example, of the "natural barrier" of the Taiwan Strait which would make China putting troops on the ground much more difficult than Russia just crossing over its land border with Ukraine.  Taiwan also has a large and well-equipped air force, and is developing its own formidable missile strike capability.  China has been stepping up its military pressure against Taiwan over the past two years or so.  Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims, and says only the island's people can decide their future.

"If we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave hits," Biden said in remarks at the White House to launch COVID.gov, a clearinghouse of information aimed at helping people manage the virus as they seek a return to normalcy.  On Tuesday, U.S. health officials authorized a second booster shot for Americans age 50 and older and those who are immunocompromised, two years after the start of the pandemic. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Biden, 79, received his fourth dose of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)/BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) vaccine.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  U.S. officials have said they do not expect another major surge, but noted COVID cases could rise from BA.2 or a subsequent variant, reflecting the administration's position that the country must learn to live with and adapt to some level of this coronavirus.  Biden has asked Congress for another tranche of funding to pay for current vaccinations and treatments, as well as to shore up the nation's preparedness for future outbreaks.  "We need to secure additional supply now," he said on Wednesday, warning free COVID vaccines may not be available this autumn without more funds, especially if a new vaccine is needed. "Congress, please act... immediately. The consequences of inaction are severe."  Biden, who had sought $22.5 billion, this month warned the U.S. government would run out of funding for supplies without more support. read more  Lawmakers lowered the amount before dropping it altogether from the most recent government funding bill, with congressional Democrats saying they will take up COVID funding separately.

Picture taken February 23, 2022. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage  PALMERDALE, Ala., March 30 (Reuters) - North of Birmingham, a gravel road bed slices through a series of steep ridges, part of a stalled effort to carve a 52-mile freeway around the rural fringes of Alabama's largest city.  Construction stopped five years ago on the road, dubbed the Birmingham Northern Beltline, after federal funding ran out. Critics have labeled the project a "dinosaur," a "zombie" and a "black hole". Barely a mile of it has been started, and Alabama officials haven't provided the billions it would take to finish it.  But the bulldozers could soon be moving again, thanks to U.S. taxpayers. At least $369 million in federal funding for the Beltline is headed Alabama's way from a massive infrastructure package approved by Congress in November. That $1 trillion deal - the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - allowed Democratic President Joe Biden to fulfill a campaign promise to fix the nation's crumbling bridges, roads and airports.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It's also a big win for Alabama's senior U.S. senator, Richard Shelby, a Republican who has worked for decades to carve out Washington dollars for the Beltline. Shelby voted "no" on Biden's infrastructure package, arguing that it should have included military projects. The Beltline will get its funding all the same.  Shelby declined to comment for this story.  Other Beltline supporters portray the federal support as money still owed to Alabama from Democratic President Lyndon Johnson's 1960s War on Poverty, which promised to help impoverished residents of the Appalachian mountains. At the southern end of that range lie the blue-collar exurbs and rural hamlets north of Birmingham.  "This is the continuation of a promise made," said Ron Kitchens, chief executive officer of the Birmingham Business Alliance, an economic development group.  Opponents of the Beltline, meanwhile, are incensed that a gusher of cash is set to revive a dormant project that even local planning officials once ranked as a middling priority. Environmentalists say the Beltline would encourage sprawl and threaten wild areas - the antithesis of Biden's green agenda.  "It's a true dinosaur of a pork barrel project," said Nelson Brooke of Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a local environmental group. "It's a perfect example of what shouldn't be happening with this new money."  Biden's administration is writing the check, but it has little say over Alabama's project, which is funded through a special account for highways in the region. Nancy Singer, a spokesperson for the Federal Highway Administration, said states that receive that money control those projects as long as they comply with federal rules.  PHANTOM FREEWAY  The Beltline isn't the only controversial aspect of Biden's infrastructure deal. Many Democrats groused that it favors freeways over transit, while some Republicans derided it as a wasteful grab bag of Democratic priorities.  Alabama's phantom freeway might never have made it past the blueprint stage if not for Shelby, a Birmingham native who has served in Congress since 1979. His name adorns government facilities across Alabama, a testament to his skill at steering federal dollars to a state where household income ranks 46th of the 50 U.S. states.  Starting around the turn of the century, Shelby and other members of Alabama's congressional delegation secured money for the Beltline through "earmarking," a budget process that ensured the highway got dedicated funding without having to compete with other projects.  But the real breakthrough came in 2003, when Shelby got the Beltline added to the Appalachian Development Highway System, a road network aimed at reducing isolation in the mountainous region stretching from northern Alabama to western New York. The system was largely complete at that point, so Shelby's move ensured Alabama would get a larger share of the dollars going to that network.  Then came a series of corruption scandals that spurred federal lawmakers to crack down on what many saw as wasteful spending nationwide. Congress banned earmarks in 2010. Two years later, it eliminated funding for the Appalachian highway system amid criticism by legislators such as Representative Jared Polis, a Democrat who now serves as governor of Colorado, who called the Beltline a "zombie highway" and the "Alabama Porkway."  With those two funding streams cut, the Beltline had to compete for money on its own merits. But the highway was not deemed particularly urgent by the Birmingham Metropolitan Planning Organization, a regional governmental body. In a 2010 report, it ranked the Beltline 36th out of 54 transportation proposals, concluding it would do little to ease traffic congestion.  Beltline proponents say the road could help the thinly populated northern exurbs draw the sorts of shopping malls and housing developments that have proliferated to the south of the city since the 1970s. But the Alabama Department of Transportation in 2012 estimated that, once completed, the Beltline would boost the population in nearby towns by just 1.5%.  Environmental groups in 2011 sued unsuccessfully to stop the project, saying the Beltline would harm wildlife like the vermilion darter fish, which is found nowhere else in the world. The highway would cross 125 streams and require construction teams to level more than 4,000 acres (1,619 hectares) of forest.  But business groups and dozens of local politicians continued to advocate for the road. By the time it broke ground in 2014, Federal Highway Administration figures indicated that, at a cost of $5.4 billion, it would be the priciest highway project in the country on a per-mile basis, though subsequent estimates have been lower. State officials estimated at the time it would take 40 years to complete.  Two years later, construction ground to a halt when federal money ran out. At that point, $162 million had been spent to produce a partially built, 1.3-mile (2 km) stretch of roadway.  Most U.S. highways are built with a mix of federal and state money. But Alabama chose not to tap state accounts for the Beltline, instead focusing on maintaining existing roads and expanding capacity elsewhere. No work has been done since.  "People are tired of dribbling money into a black hole," said Sarah Stokes, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which opposes the project.  On a recent weekday afternoon, signs of decay were evident at the construction site near Palmerdale, a hamlet of 5,400 residents 17 miles (27 kilometers) northeast of Birmingham. Rainstorms had etched gullies into the gravel roadbed, and a 20-foot-tall (6 meters) chinaberry tree sprouted from a concrete retaining wall at the top of a ridge. Tire tracks, trash and a bullet-riddled tin can littered the site.  BACK ON TRACK  But patience - and seniority - pay off in Washington. Shelby got funding renewed for the Appalachian highway network in 2019, when he headed the powerful Senate committee that handles spending.  Then came the bipartisan infrastructure package. Lawmakers from Appalachian states, led by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, inserted $1.25 billion for the highway network into the deal. Alabama is due to get $369 million, the largest share.  Much more will be needed. The Appalachian Regional Commission, a government body, estimated last year that it would cost $3.1 billion to finish the Beltline, and the state said in 2019 that it would take until 2045 to complete just one-third of the road. Experts say such estimates can fluctuate widely due to changing labor costs, interest rates and other factors.  As before, Alabama does not plan to put its own money into the project. Budget experts say that is telling.  "It's not that critical of a project," said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. "Otherwise the state and local interests would have found a way to fund this."  Birmingham-area officials say they are negotiating for the state and local governments to chip in. Stan Hogeland, mayor of Gardendale, a city of 16,000 residents along the Beltline's path, believes the road could speed commute times and attract manufacturers serving the state's auto industry.  "I hope it hurries up and gets through," Hogeland said.  Others see it as yet another highway designed to steer investment away from Black-majority cities such as Birmingham.  Anna Brown, an activist who sits on an advisory board for the planning commission, said it would be better to send the money back to Washington.  "Everything free ain't always good for you," Brown said of the federal funds. "Just because it's free doesn't mean it's going to be beneficial."

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri  OAKLAND, Calif., March 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith wrote to Ukraine's leader this month with a clear message: despite Kyiv's calls for it to sever all ties with Russia, the U.S. software behemoth would continue doing business in the country with non-sanctioned clients, including schools and hospitals.  "Depriving these institutions of software updates and services could put at risk the health and safety of innocent civilians, including children and the elderly," Smith said in the previously unreported March 14 letter, seen by Reuters.  Smith told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Microsoft was "mindful of the moral responsibility" to protect civilians. However, he said the company was discussing with U.S., British and EU governments whether "to halt any ongoing services and support" in Russia and would move "in lockstep with their sanctions and other economic goals."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Asked about the exchange, spokespeople for both Microsoft and Ukraine said a constructive dialogue was underway about actions to support the country.  The decision by some leading Western business technology makers - including Microsoft, German software multinational SAP SE (SAPG.DE) and U.S. giant International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) - to maintain operations or staff in Russia despite Ukraine's appeals have angered their workers in several countries.  Small groups of employees at Microsoft, SAP and IBM have called for management to withdraw fully from Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, according to comments seen by Reuters on internal discussion forums and interviews with 18 workers familiar with the companies, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  The employees – echoing Ukrainian officials – have urged the companies to go beyond ending new sales and dropping sanctioned clients in order to increase economic pressure on Moscow. They want their companies to suspend every deal in Russia, including for software clients may use to track sales, supply chains and workforces.  Asked about the internal criticism, IBM said it has ceased working with Russian companies anywhere in the world - though it has stopped short of layoffs or suspending support of foreign businesses in Russia.  SAP told Reuters it was complying with government actions and even going beyond them, and it would "welcome new sanctions currently under discussion."  SAP responded to Ukraine's requests to cut all ties in Russia with a previously undisclosed letter this month to President Zelenskiy – reviewed in part by Reuters – saying that it was supporting essential Russian services, including "hospitals, civilian infrastructure and food supply chains."  The three companies have not ruled out further pullback. But for now, their employees in Russia are getting paid and accessing workplace tools, colleagues said. Local phone numbers are active for all three, Reuters found.  Questioned about the demands on Western tech businesses from their own workers and the Ukrainian government to quit Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said that "some companies are leaving, others are staying. New ones will come in their place."  The spokesperson noted that companies had legal obligations to employees that must be fulfilled, such as paying wages.  Russian prosecutors have warned some Western businesses that their staff could face arrests if production of essential goods was stopped, according to media reports. read more The Wall Street Journal named IBM among those warned.  The Kremlin spokesperson denied the reports about pressure on companies from prosecutors: "The part about arrests is a lie."  UKRAINIAN LOBBYING  Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, one of the leading campaigners for a digital blockade, said Russia was already feeling the impact as some technology companies exit, such as developers of digital payment and web development tools. But he is pushing for a complete departure.  "We will keep trying until those companies have made the decision to leave Russia," he said.  Fedorov's team told Reuters last week that a "huge number" of Russian organizations have contracts for SAP's software, including major banking and energy companies. Reuters could not independently confirm SAP's customers in Russia, and SAP said it was in full compliance with sanctions.  Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media did not answer requests for comment on the impact of departures by Western technology companies, nor the extent of SAP's footprint in the country.  Mirroring the Ukrainian government's message, SAP's five salespeople for Ukraine told regional managers on a call March 18 that the company must end support for remaining Russian clients, according to a person familiar with the discussion.  Fedorov said on Friday in a tweet, citing a conversation with SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein, that the company would "gradually stop supporting" products in Russia. A day earlier, SAP had said it was shutting its Russian cloud business, which two sources described as a small operation.  In a March 23 letter sent to customers in Russia, reviewed by Reuters, SAP asked cloud clients to advise whether their data in the Russian cloud should be deleted, handed back to them or moved outside the country.  SAP confirmed the content of the letter, and said that Fedorov and Klein spoke. It declined to comment further.  At IBM, hundreds of workers criticized the company's response to Russia's invasion, three people with knowledge of internal messages said.  CEO Arvind Krishna on a March 2 call with employees had taken no sides on the war, one of the sources said. In a now-public message to workers the previous day, IBM had referred to what it described as the "deteriorating situation involving Ukraine and Russia."  One comment on an internal discussion forum, seen by Reuters, called on the CEO to read a book on IBM's work during the Holocaust describing how the company designed punch-card machines that Nazi Germany used to track Jewish people: "Think carefully and do the right thing - pull IBM and IBMer's in Russia out of Russia," the employee wrote.  IBM declined to comment on the remark.  Responding to the outcry, Krishna announced in a March 3 post a suspension of sales in Russia and condemned "the Russian war in Ukraine." On March 7, he went further, saying that IBM had suspended "all business" in Russia – without elaborating.  An IBM spokesperson told Reuters March 24 that the business suspension meant the company is no longer providing "goods, parts, software, services, consulting and technology" anywhere in the world to Russian clients.  Several Microsoft workers on internal chat tools have also demanded the company exit Russia altogether, with some even telling senior management they would quit otherwise, an employee said. Microsoft declined to comment.  DOUBTS  Some workers told Reuters they have not joined the calls for full exits due to doubts over harming civilians and how strong an impact the companies' withdrawal from Russia would have.  For instance, the United States on Feb. 24 sanctioned Russian Railways, a state-owned company operating passenger and freight trains. IBM that day placed the company on its “Denied Parties List” and stopped tech support, according to an IBM letter to Ukrainian minister Fedorov dated March 5, seen by Reuters.  Denied parties cannot access official replacement discs, adapters and memory for mainframes that a former IBM salesperson said need swapping every two years.  But a person familiar with operations at Russian Railways said it can run for years without aid.  Russian Railways did not respond to requests for comment. IBM declined to comment.  SAP also told Reuters that because some clients have its software installed on their machines they can keep using it regardless of the company's decision not to provide support.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke  KELHEIM, Germany, March 31 (Reuters) - Germany's Mittelstand, the small and mid-sized companies that power Europe's largest economy, was already battling its biggest crisis in a decade trying to absorb rocketing energy bills.  Then the government warned it might have to turn off the gas.  A standoff with top supplier Russia over its demand to be paid in roubles - part of a wider economic tit-for-tat sparked by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine - prompted Berlin to activate emergency plans on Wednesday that could eventually lead to gas rationing if Russia disrupts or halts supplies. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Heavy industry, which accounts for a quarter of German gas demand, would be hit first, threatening jobs and the country's economic recovery from two years of pandemic.  "If we don't get gas we'll have to switch off," Craig Barker, the managing director of Kelheim Fibres, whose fibres are used in everything from tea bags to tampons, told Reuters.  Kelheim exemplifies the Mittelstand - private, family run companies that span industrial sectors, employ nearly two out of three workers, and account for a third of corporate turnover.  Its gas bill is set to increase more than five-fold this year to 100 million euros ($110 million) - equivalent to more than half of its annual sales - as the conflict in Ukraine exacerbates an already tight energy market.  With no easy alternative sources of energy, and struggling to pass on costs to customers like Kimberly-Clark (KMB.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N), the crisis is putting the company's future in doubt.  "The current situation is threatening our very existence," said Wolfgang Ott, an executive at the 86-year-old firm which has 600 staff at its factory in the Bavarian town of Kelheim.  Kelheim has already applied to authorities to be treated as a systemically relevant firm, which would help it access supplies should gas rationing kick in. Its fibres are needed in several hygiene products.  RUNNING ON GAS  Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Germany's heavy reliance on Russian gas - Russia accounted for 55% of Germany's gas imports in 2021.  Alternative supplies won't come cheap or fast. Berlin has warned it could take until mid-2024 until Germany can live without Russian gas. read more  That leaves companies, and the wider economy, exposed.  "Rising electricity and gas prices threaten to crush the economy," said Siegfried Russwurm, president of Germany's BDI industry association and chairman of Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE), which has warned it might have to introduce shorter working hours as soon as next week.  This, he said, raised the risk of companies considering moving production abroad to save costs.  Germany's engineering and chemicals associations, the country's second- and third-largest industry groups, have halved or scrapped their growth outlooks for this year in response to higher costs and supply chain issues.  German soda and natron maker Ciech Soda Deutschland, a unit of Poland's Ciech SA (CIEP.WA) which supplies glassworks as well as the pharma and automotive industries, is another stalwart of the Mittelstand suffering.  With additional gas costs of 22 million euros per month, it is bleeding money and may be forced to stop production, the economy minister of Saxony-Anhalt, the German state where Ciech Soda is based, warned in a recent letter seen by Reuters.  That would hurt nearby businesses that rely on its products, minister Sven Schulze wrote in the letter to German economy minister Robert Habeck, pleading for an emergency meeting to discuss the matter.  Ciech Soda Deutschland and the economy ministry declined to comment.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe  PARIS, March 30 (Reuters) - The French will head to the polls in April for a presidential election that will determine who will run the European Union's second-largest economy, and its only member with a permanent UN security council seat, as war rages on the bloc's doorstep.  * WHO WILL WIN?  The incumbent, President Emmanuel Macron, is the favourite in opinion polls. But the projected margin is narrower than when he was elected in 2017 and he is facing stiff competition from the right.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Even if he succeeds, Macron will need his centrist La Republique en Marche (LaRem) party - which has failed in all recent local elections - and its allies to win a parliamentary election in June if he is to have a strong platform to implement his policies.  * WHAT TO WATCH FOR:  - The race between Valerie Pecresse of the conservative Les Republicains, the far-right's Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour and the far-left's Jean-Luc Melenchon to be Macron's challenger in the likely second-round run-off.  - Will Macron trip up and lose his lead? In 2017, the early favourites lost the election to then-outsider Macron.  - Voter uncertainty. Opinion polls show many are unsure who they will vote for, and turnout could be much lower than usual, adding more uncertainty.  * WHAT WILL THE ELECTION BE FOUGHT OVER?  - The election campaign started amid a war in Ukraine. Polls show that could impact the vote's outcome, with initial surveys indicating a boost for Macron. read more  - Immigration and security issues had long been at the forefront of the political debate, but opinion polls show purchasing power as one of voters' top concerns, amid a huge increase in energy prices and growing inflation.  - Economic recovery, and whether it holds. Opinion polls show voters are unhappy with Macron's economic policy, but unemployment is at its lowest in years and those surveyed don't think any of his opponents would do better.  - How Macron handled the pandemic could also play a role, at a time when restrictions have been largely lifted but the number of COVID-19 cases is growing again.  * WHY DOES IT MATTER?  - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through Europe and beyond. The winner of France's election will have to deal with the fallout.  - Now that Britain has left the European Union, France is the bloc's main military power. It's also the undisputed second biggest economy in the EU, and Angela Merkel's exit as German chancellor has given Macron a more prominent role in Europe.  - The next president will face soaring public deficits to tackle the impact of the pandemic, a pension system many say needs reforming, and moves to re-industrialise France.  - The political landscape is still feeling the shockwaves from Macron's 2017 election, and the reconstruction of both the right and the left will very much depend on how the presidential and parliamentary elections pan out.  * KEY DATES  April 10 - Presidential election first round  April 24 - Second round held between the top two candidates.  May 13 - The latest day the new president takes office.  June 12 and 19 - Parliamentary election.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch  BERLIN, March 30 (Reuters) - German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, preliminary data showed on Wednesday.  Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 7.6% on the year, a steep increase from 5.5% in February, the Federal Statistics Office said.  The national consumer price index (CPI) rose 7.3% year-on-year after recording an inflation rate of 5.1% in February, as companies and service providers passed on the massive rise in energy prices to customers.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the CPI rate to rise to 6.3% and the HICP figure to grow to 6.7%.  "Welcome back to the 1970s! At least as far as food, goods and energy prices are concerned," said Jens-Oliver Niklasch at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.  "The European Central Bank has no choice but to start tightening now," said KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib in a view echoed by other experts, including Thomas Gitzel at VP Bank Group.  "If currency regulators stay relaxed, there is a risk that their later reaction will have to be all the more drastic. The U.S. Federal Reserve had this painful experience in the early 1980s," Gitzel said.  A similarly high inflation rate in Germany was last recorded in autumn 1981, when oil prices had jumped as a consequence of the first Iran–Iraq War, the statistics office said.  Economists said the inflation problem was not unique to Germany. Spain, for example, reported an inflation rate of just under 10% for March earlier on Wednesday.  "The ECB's mantra that inflation rates would be back to the ECB's target level of 2% from next year no longer works," Gitzel said. "For the first time since it was founded, the ECB is in danger of losing its credibility."  Preliminary inflation data from the German states of Saxony, North-Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg had suggested annual consumer price inflation (CPI) in a range between 7% and 8%, coming to an average of 7.54%.

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports  March 30 (Reuters) - Poland's Iga Swiatek continued her terrific run with a 6-3 6-3 win over Petra Kvitova on Wednesday to reach the Miami Open semi-finals, while Norway's Casper Ruud upset men's second seed Alexander Zverev in their quarter-final clash.  Swiatek, who came to Miami full of confidence after claiming back-to-back titles at Doha and Indian Wells, pressured twice Wimbledon champion Kvitova's serve throughout the 77-minute match and never faced a break point.  The Polish second seed, who will take over the world number one ranking next week, has now won 15 consecutive matches dating back to Qatar and will next face 16th seed Jessica Pegula.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I want to use the confidence that I built since the beginning of Doha," said Swiatek.  "I'm on a roll and I want to use that. Having that kind of streak got pretty tricky, but I'm pretty glad that I could play well, that I'm healthy, and that I can compete against players like Petra. She's a legend."  Pegula advanced after Spanish fifth seed Paula Badosa retired with a viral illness while trailing 4-1.  "Been struggling with illness since the last match the other day," Badosa wrote on Twitter. "Tried everything to recover but wasn't enough. I'll take some days to recover well and prepare for clay court season."  For Pegula, it marked the second consecutive abrupt ending to a match as unseeded Ukrainian Anhelina Kalinin retired while down 6-0 in their fourth-round clash.  Norwegian sixth seed Ruud secured the biggest win of his career with a 6-3 1-6 6-3 triumph over world number four Zverev.  After Zverev levelled the match, it was Ruud who was the aggressor in the decider as he frequently approached the net with great success, held tough during baseline rallies and limited his unforced errors.  Ruud had failed to win a set in two previous meetings against Zverev.  "I feel a little bit good. I mean, it's obviously an exciting night and the biggest win of my career so far," Ruud told reporters.  "This is now the fourth time I'm reaching a semi-final in a Masters 1000 event and ... the first time on hard court so that means it's a little bit extra special for me."  Ruud lost the three Masters semi-finals he previously played in Rome, Monte Carlo and Madrid -- all claycourt tournaments.  "Let's see if I can take what I have learned from the three previous semi-finals where unfortunately I lost all of them and see if I can turn it around and make the fourth time the lucky charm," he added.  Up next for Ruud will be Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, whose dream run in his ATP Masters 1000 debut continued after Italian ninth seed Jannik Sinner was forced to retire from their match with foot blisters.  Cerundolo, who is ranked 103rd, was leading 4-1 when Sinner decided to call the match and becomes the lowest-ranked men's singles semi-finalist in the tournament's history.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/  Summary G7 sharing information, working together on digital regulation  BOJ starts 2nd-phase experiment on digital yen from April  Global CBDC drive could cause big change to settlement system  TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - G7 policymakers must speed up creation of a common framework to regulate digital currencies, as the Ukraine war heightens the need to avoid them being used as a loophole against sanctions, a senior Bank of Japan official said.  Cryptoassets and stablecoins have come under the regulatory spotlight amid concerns they could be used to evade financial sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.  Such digital currencies could upend the global settlement system as they make it easier to circumvent conventional payment means using the U.S. dollar, euro and yen, said Kazushige Kamiyama, the head of the BOJ's payment and settlement systems department.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "By using stablecoins, it's not very difficult to create an individual global settlement system," Kamiyama told Reuters in an interview.  Policymakers of the Group of Seven advanced economies must act quickly in laying out a common understanding on how to update current rules, which do not sufficiently take into account the growing presence of digital currencies, he said.  "G7 nations are now working together on this front, while sharing information on current developments," said Kamiyama, who is involved in G7 discussions on digital currencies.  U.S. allies including Japan imposed sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, including the removal of many Russian banks from the global payments system SWIFT.  But regulating cryptoassets and stablecoins isn't easy, as holders can transfer funds across borders far more easily than through legal tender.  The need to balance privacy and money-laundering concerns will also affect debate on the design of a digital yen, said Kamiyama, whose department is charged with the BOJ's experiments on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The BOJ will begin the second phase of experiments from April, which will last about a year and check features such as whether to set a limit on the sum each entity can hold, he said.  While BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said a decision on whether to issue CBDC may come by 2026, Kamiyama said the timing will depend partly on how quickly other central banks move.  "Given how so many advanced nation central banks are moving collectively, dramatically and simultaneously on CBDC, it could cause big changes in the settlement system in the future," he said. "Japan needs to make sure it's not left behind."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada; Editing by Lincoln Feast.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes  TURIN, March 31 (Reuters) - A Stellantis (STLA.MI) van plant in Russia will have to close shortly as it is running out of parts, the company's chief executive Carlos Tavares said on Thursday.  The company has previously said it had suspended all exports and imports of vehicles with Russia, where it operates a van-making plant in the city of Kaluga, in partnership with Mitsubishi (8058.T).  Production in Kaluga remains for the local market at the moment, following last month's Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Speaking at a news conference, Tavares did not say whether the company was considering a writedown of the value of Kaluga or feared it could be seized by Moscow if operations halted.  Addressing a supply crisis that has hurt the car industry, Tavares said Stellantis expected to be able to source computer chips from Europe and the United States within 3-4 years.  "We will have to find another way to adapt the supply chain, we have several initiatives to create local sourcing of semiconductors," added Tavares, the head of a company whose brands include Fiat and Peugeot.  Tavares said carmakers needed to cut the costs of electric vehicles over the next 4-5 years and called on governments to help with the effort.

REUTERS/Mike Blake  WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - Hackers who crippled tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and across Europe are still trying to hobble U.S. telecommunications company Viasat as it works to bring its users back online, a company official told Reuters.  Viasat Inc (VSAT.O) has been working to recover after a cyberattack remotely disabled satellite modems just as Russian forces pushed into Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 24. The official said a parallel attack was launched at almost exactly the same time and used "high volumes of focused, malicious traffic" to try and overwhelm Viasat's network and was still ongoing.  "We're still witnessing some deliberate attempts," the official said Tuesday. He said that Viasat was so far resisting the hackers with defensive measures but that "we've been seeing repeated attempts by this attacker to alter that pattern to test those new mitigations and defenses."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The official - who spoke on the condition that he not be identified - briefed Reuters ahead of a report being published early Wednesday which outlines how the hackers systematically sabotaged satellite modems across Europe - and in Ukraine in particular - on the morning of Russia's invasion.  The exact effect of the outage on Ukraine still is not clear, but the disruptive hack triggered "a really huge loss in communications" at the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora told reporters during a briefing on March 15. read more  Few other details have been released since. On Friday, the Washington Post said that U.S. analysts believed that the hackers were working for Russia's military intelligence agency.  The report did not identify the hackers and the Viasat official said the company would not be commenting on who might be responsible.  The Russian Embassy in Washington has not responded to repeated attempts to seek comment about the hack.  Viasat's report said that the intruders took advantage of a misconfigured virtual private networking device to gain remote access to the management network for the company's KA-SAT satellite, which is run by an Italy-based company called Skylogic and serves customers across Europe.  Skylogic did not immediately return a message late Tuesday.  The report said that it was from inside the network that the hackers sent rogue commands to tens of thousands of modems all at once, overwriting key chunks of data in the device's memory and rendering them inoperable.  The report said the disruptive hack began about 6:15 a.m. Ukraine time on Feb. 24 and would eventually cripple a majority of Viasat's modems in Ukraine. The parallel attack using malicious traffic began about an hour earlier.  The company declined to provide a global figure of stricken devices but the report said that nearly 30,000 fresh modems had already been shipped to distributors to bring customers back online.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo  LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - China’s economy was losing momentum in the first quarter, even before the full impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on commodity prices and global supply chains was felt.  The country’s central bank warned about the “triple pressures from shrinking demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations” in its quarterly review of monetary policy published on March 30.  Policymakers blamed the increasingly severe and uncertain environment on the continuing epidemic overseas, escalating geopolitical conflicts, and the increasing frequency of domestic coronavirus outbreaks.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In the first quarter, the bank’s regular survey of 5,000 enterprises nationwide found both domestic and export orders shrinking at the fastest rates since epidemic’s first wave two years ago and before that early 2016.  The domestic orders index fell to 41.4, while export orders fell to 40.9, both well below the 50-point threshold that divides expanding activity from a contraction.  (Chartbook: https://tmsnrt.rs/3qMOs6D)  In response, the central bank has pledged to boost confidence, provide stronger support to the real economy and stabilise major economic aggregates, underscoring the depth of the slowdown.  But China’s business cycle downturn has taken a little of the heat out of commodity markets being severely disrupted by the conflict in Ukraine.  If China’s manufacturers and service-sector businesses were not struggling, it is likely oil and other commodity prices would have soared very much higher already.  Escalating prices for raw materials, supply chain problems caused by Russia’s invasion and the sanctions imposed in response, and heightened business and household uncertainty now threaten to make the downturn worse.  For commodity markets, the critical question is whether the slowdown will be prolonged and sap consumption growth through the rest of the year, injecting some slack into the system.  Or whether a fresh cyclical upturn in the world’s largest commodity importer will tighten markets even further later in 2022 and into 2023, intensifying inflationary pressures.  - John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  ORLANDO, Fla., March 30 (Reuters) - The first quarter was a scary ride for most investors but those who stuck to a conventional '60-40' portfolio of stocks and bonds escaped relatively unscathed.  Having endured an energy price shock after Russia invaded Ukraine, rising interest rates and U.S. bond market plunge, and wild divergent swings in stocks and commodities, investors will be glad to see the back of the first quarter.  But the benchmark, long-term '60-40' equity/fixed income investment portfolio held up reasonably well. That's because most of the pain came on the smaller bond side of the portfolio, and because the remarkable rebound on the larger stocks side late in the quarter significantly reduced overall losses.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  According to Barry Gilbert at LPL Financial in Boston, a simple portfolio weighted 60% the S&P 500 and 40% the Bloomberg aggregate U.S. bond index lost around 4% in the January-March period.  That was 'only' the 19th worst performance out of 185 quarters going back to 1976, when the aggregate bond index was launched. There have been 47 'down' quarters in total, the worst of all in late 2008 when losses topped 11%.  The average decline of these 'down' quarters is around 4%, roughly where the portfolio will close the current quarter.  "The first quarter was a big shock for investors. But if you're looking at 60-40, it's not good, but it's not horrible," Gilbert said. "We've been a little bit spoiled by the long bull market in bonds and sometimes people forget that bonds have risk too."  Gilbert notes that the aggregate index comprising Treasuries, investment grade corporate and mortgage-backed bonds is down around 6%, on track for the third worst quarter since 1976. S&P 500 total returns are down around 2.5%  Other cuts of the U.S. bond market show the first quarter was equally bleak historically. The Bank of America Treasuries index lost 6% and the corporate bond index lost 9%, both the worst in at least 25 years.  Chart  Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Natixis, notes that an index of the two-year Treasury note as measured by its weekly total return compared with a year earlier had its biggest fall ever, even worse than the bond market routs of the early 1980s and 1994.  Yields have shot up enough, and it may be time to buy.  "A person of courage would get long the long end. The market is pricing in a lot of Fed tightening, probably too much. The slope of the curve gives me confidence that the front end will rally at some point. Perhaps sooner rather than later," he said.  Natixis  SHAFTS OF LIGHT  If the 60-40 investor is feeling any relief right now it is thanks to the rebound in stocks. As recently as March 15 the S&P 500 was down 14% year-to-date and on March 14 the Nasdaq (.IXIC) confirmed a bear market, down 20% from its November peak.  The S&P 500 is back to within 5% of the all-time high it struck on January 4.  It was a similar picture globally. The MSCI World will end the quarter down around 4%, its worst performance since the pandemic crash two years ago. But it was also down 14% two weeks ago, and of the 47 negative quarters since the late 1980s, there have been 21 larger declines.  Valuations have come down and are closer to - although still above - long-term averages, and history suggests that stocks typically rebound after the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falls below the two-year yield, as briefly occurred on Tuesday.  Recession risks are undoubtedly rising and inverted curves across the rates and bond markets confirm that. But imminent contraction is not in the cards, giving investors scope to push equities higher.  "Overall we find too much negativity rather than too much complacency in markets, and stay with a pro risk stance in our model portfolio," JP Morgan strategists wrote on Wednesday.  Analysts at UBS note that since 1965 the S&P 500 has returned an average of 8% in the 12 months following an inversion of the 2s/10s part of the U.S. yield curve.  Strategists at Truist IAG calculate that the average return is 11%, based on the previous seven inversions going back to 1978.

In recent days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, dubbed a "special operation" by Moscow, the town's churches have been packed with locals wracked by feelings of despair and powerlessness, praying for friends and families back in Ukraine.  Meroslawa Krevei, a museum curator of Ukrainian descent, walks along the entrance of the Sagrado Coracao de Jesus Catechist Institute. Civil servant Oksana Jadvizak, 35, first visited Ukraine in 2008 on a scholarship. She was still there in 2014, during the Maidan uprising that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich, now exiled in Russia. One of her professors died in those clashes, and Jadvizak said she was horrified by the recent escalation with Russia that has left Ukraine a smoldering pile of rubble. "It's so impactful to see the tanks of war and planes flying over, and hearing my friends saying they are going to battle," she said in front of a Byzantine church, wearing the Ukrainian soccer jersey, and a yellow-and-blue flag draped around her shoulders. With the sound of a choir rising behind her, Jadvizak had come out to show solidarity with those in Ukraine.  Ukrainian descendants and members of the "Cossack brotherhood" pray the rosary inside the Sao Josafat church. "We're going to pray so that everything ends well," said Jadvizak, who is of fourth generation Ukrainian descent, and counts Portuguese as her second language. Some in the town drew parallels between their own families' exit from Ukraine, and that of the millions of refugees fleeing in the wake of Russia's invasion. Nadia Rurak Techy, 66, a shopkeeper whose parents came to Brazil after living through the "terror" of World War Two, said she feared Ukrainian culture would be erased.  Nadia Rurak Techy holds a photo of her parents. "I'm distraught," she said, breaking into tears at her clothes shop. "Ukraine doesn't deserve this ... Our homeland has to be free. It needs to remain beautiful, as it always was." ECONOMIC MIGRANTS Ukrainian migrants, many from the western Galicia region that includes the city of Lviv, began arriving in Prudentopolis in 1896, according to Anderson Prado, a historian from the Federal University of Parana who has studied the town's roots. He said Ukrainians were fleeing extreme poverty, just a few decades after Tsarist Russia outlawed serfdom.  The Prudentopolis city known as "Little Ukraine”. They found a welcome home in the vast, fertile south of Brazil. The country, which had recently abolished slavery, was desperate for workers to develop its farmland, and actively recruited Europeans through publicity campaigns. The first roughly 1,500 Ukrainian families that arrived worked in agriculture and sawmills, industries that remain major employers to this day, Prado said.  The Nossa Senhora do Patrocinio church. The people of Prudentopolis, named after former Brazilian President Prudente de Morais, have retained surprisingly close ties with Ukraine, Prado said. Over three-quarters of the town's 52,000 people speak some Ukrainian, its official second language. "The descendants who live in Prudentopolis have a fundamental connection with Ukraine," he said. "They are very close to their relatives who stayed there, and the vast majority dream of returning or visiting the land of their origins."  Filomena Procek, 67, an art teacher of Ukrainian descent, watches the news about Ukraine accompanied by family friend, Maria Luiza Burcovski, 17. Dental surgeon Rodrigo Michalovski, 31, agreed. He is part of a decades-old group in the town known as the "Cossack Brotherhood." The club seeks to maintain ties with Ukrainian culture through dances and historical presentations. Almost all members are Catholic and dress up in traditional clothes, keeping their hair and beards in the classic Cossack style. "We learn to love Ukraine from childhood ... and we carry that love for our entire lives," Michalovski said. "Every bit of sad news about the war is a stab in my chest, in my heart. We will only have peace again when the fire in Ukraine stops, when I know that our people are safe."  Rodrigo Michalovski dresses in the typical attire of the "Cossack brotherhood”. With few means to help those in Ukraine, Jadvizak, the civil servant, said she was offering whatever support she could. "Today I sent a message to my friends saying that if they needed, my house is open," she said. "I think everyone here in Prudentopolis, where 70% of the population is of Ukrainian descent, is willing to shelter people." Thiago Zakalugne, 36, a mechanic and fellow member of the "Cossack Brotherhood," echoed the views of many in Prudentopolis, who were at a loss for ways to help. Like them, he was also putting his faith in the divine.  Helena Kachuski, 80, a Ukrainian descendant, and her husband Jose Petel, 81, watch the news on television at home.  Story "Each bomb that falls over there, each drop of Ukrainian blood spilled is a piece of our heart that breaks," he said. "If I could, I would certainly go, to try to help somehow ... but our way of helping from here right now is with prayer."

Transitioning is not illegal in Ghana, but it will become so if a new law is passed, intended to tighten already strict anti-LGBT+ regulations which render same-sex relations illegal.  Homophobia is pervasive in the West African country and trans people are generally considered to be gay.  Fiatsi holds two photographs showing her gender transition journey. Fiatsi first exhibited the photographs, dubbed "Rituals of Becoming", in 2017. Supportive audiences flocked to see the show in Ghanaian galleries. Her work reflects how LGBT+ people in Ghana have navigated legal and social constraints to carve out a space to express their identities. But Fiatsi fears that even that limited space could now be closing with the new bill, which if it passes would see her risk prosecution every time she puts on a dress.  Fiatsi holds up a gown. "To say I'm afraid is an understatement, but I am what I am," said Fiatsi, who runs an artist residence in Kumasi, Ghana's second city. "It feels like waiting to be slaughtered," she said. Ghana is one of more than 30 African countries that outlaw same-sex relations. Guilty verdicts carry up to three-year prison sentences.  Fiatsi meets with Richmond Anokye, 22, a member of the LGBTQ+ community. A group of lawmakers from Ghana's opposition introduced a what they called "Family Values Bill" in November, which would impose jail terms of up to 10 years for advocacy of LGBT+ causes and between three and five years for those who "hold out" as lesbian, gay, non-binary, transgender and transsexual, or who undergo or perform surgical procedures for gender reassignment. The bill, which has broad backing among lawmakers but has yet to be voted on, also includes a provision that would force some to undergo conversion therapy. Amnesty International said this could violate Ghana's anti-torture laws.  Artwork is seen on a compound belonging to Fiatsi. No politician has come out publicly against it. President Nana Akufo-Addo urged civil debate and tolerance when the bill was introduced but did not take a stance on its content. Opponents say its passage would be a major setback for a country whose reputation as a friendly and stable democracy attracts tourists and investors. Its backers say LGBT+ activities threaten the concept of family which is central to the structure of all Ghana's ethnic groups. No voting date has been set.  Fiatsi works inside her office as her studio assistant, Martin Toloku and brother, Wonder Fiatsi, prepare lunch. "I call it the 'Anti-Human' bill," said Fiatsi, who is a former Christian pastor. "It takes away from our family values of being a tolerant country, and being hospitable and loving." "WE ARE ALL THE SAME" There have been no national opinion polls on the bill. Advocates say LGBT+ people are often subject to physical abuse and blackmail in Ghana, and those who come out or are outed are frequently ostracised by friends and family. "There are some of my siblings and cousins who, for over five years, we never spoke, even though I love and miss them so much," said Fiatsi. "Most of them think I'm just a demon."  Fiatsi visits local beautician, Lydia Kissiwaa, 33, to get her hair styled. So do many of her former colleagues. Christian leaders have been among the most outspoken champions of the bill. When public hearings began in November, Abraham Ofori-Kuragu, a spokesperson for the influential Pentecostal-Charismatic council, said he had never seen a law "so bold in its presentation of the Ghanaian agenda." More than 70% of Ghana's 30 million people are Christian, and billboards with the faces of popular preachers adorn most street corners in the capital Accra. Some faith leaders condemn advocacy for LGBT+ rights as a Western imposition. No longer welcome at the churches where she used to preach, Fiatsi channels her evangelism into art and activism.  A portrait Fiatsi is displayed on a wall inside her home and studio. Her studio compound, where she hosts LGBT-friendly artist residency programmes, is filled with sculptures carved from tree trunks or shaped from old electronics. Murals and affirmations like "We Are All The Same" line the walls. She has a global network of allies but she insists she will stay in Ghana out of solidarity with those unable to leave. Even as the perils of life as a trans woman rise, Fiatsi takes comfort in small acts of humanity. Shortly after the bill was introduced, she travelled for a funeral to her family's village, her first time back in 20 years.  Fiatsi and her brother, Prince Fiatsi, 47, greet people as they arrive at their family's village for the funeral of a their grandmother. She stood nervously in her dress and heels. Some people exchanged pleasantries, while others darted their eyes and quietly sniggered. Before too long, the awkwardness gave way to familial warmth. A relative patted her back. Another asked how life was going. When someone made a snide comment, Fiatsi playfully stuck her tongue out before continuing her conversation.  Fiatsi talks with family members during the first visit back to her family's village in twenty years.  Story "There are many more of us that will be born, even far after I'm gone," she said. "What I do today is not for me, or even for those living today. It's for the future generation."

At the Los Angeles International Airport, Nicole, now 7, greeted her mother with a single red rose. Michelle, nearly a teenager, hung back with a bouquet of roses and sunflowers. When Hernandez turned towards her, Michelle rushed into her embrace, sobbing.  "I was far away but always thinking of you," Hernandez whispered to her daughters.  Hernandez is seen at her home in Honduras. The trio had crossed into the United States in search of asylum. Once apprehended, Hernandez said, she was given an impossible choice: Leave the country, either with the girls or without them. Rattled by recent threats to Michelle from Honduran gangs, Hernandez decided the girls would be safer in the United States, she said. The sisters were sent to a children's shelter in California and eventually released to live with their brother Maynor, now 34, who earns a living selling oranges in Los Angeles. Hernandez was deported, one of thousands of parents separated from their children under then-President Donald Trump's controversial "zero tolerance" policy to deter illegal immigration. Reuters, which has followed the family since 2020, is referring to the girls by their middle names to protect their privacy.  Hernandez talks on a video call with her youngest daughter Nicole. Over the years, Hernandez tried to bridge the 2,800 mile (4,500 km) gap between them with near daily video calls, studying their faces on a smartphone screen and listening to their stories. Nicole reported losing a tooth; Michelle confessed her crushes. On her first night in the United States, Hernandez shared a bed with her daughters, gazing at them as they slept and marveling at how much they had grown. "So many years without seeing them," she said to Reuters this month, her voice shaky from crying. "They are so big now."  Video 'A HUMAN TRAGEDY’ The Trump administration contended that allowing families to be released together in the United States while they applied for asylum only encouraged illegal immigration. In response, the administration sought to prosecute and deport parents like Hernandez and place their children in U.S. custody as "unaccompanied minors." But traumatic family separations, which began in 2017 before any official announcement, were captured in the media worldwide and caused international outcry. Trump, a Republican, reversed course with an executive order ending the practice in June 2018. Jeff Sessions, an attorney general under Trump and the force behind "zero tolerance," defended the strategy in an interview with Reuters last March, saying a person crossing the border illegally with a child "shouldn't be given immunity." However, he expressed regret for the separations.  Hernandez arrives to work at a banana plantation accompanied by her grandson Aron. As of Jan. 25, the Biden task force had reunited 126 kids with their parents or legal guardians. About 377 more - from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil, and Venezuela - have reunifications in progress, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Setting up a process to bring back parents who were deported to countries across Latin America took months, in part because of the Trump administration's incomplete and shoddy record-keeping, the task force said. A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. To aid the task force, the Biden administration created the websites Together.gov and Juntos.gov, where families can register for reunification.  Hernandez helps her grandson Aron to dress. The administration is “dedicated to finding every family and ensuring families have long-term stability in the United States," said Michelle Brane, the head of the task force in a statement. Still, some families have been left frustrated, even distraught, at the slow pace of reunifications, according to migrant advocates. "We are talking about people who haven't seen their kids in three or four years," said Hernandez's lawyer Carol Anne Donohoe, who manages the Family Reunification Project at the non-profit immigrant advocacy group based at the U.S.-Mexico border Al Otro Lado. ”Why are you making them jump through these hoops?," she said. "Any question you ask these parents is extremely traumatizing, because they are panicking and thinking 'Oh no, I am not going to get back.'"  Local residents walk around an industrial area of Northwest Honduras. TIPS FROM TAXI DRIVERS It fell to Honduran attorney Dora Melara to search for Hernandez. Melara was enlisted in early 2020 by the New York-based advocacy organization Justice in Motion, as part of the lawsuit against the U.S. government brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. Melara had only an incomplete name and location for Hernandez from a U.S. government list of parents and guardians who had been separated from their children at the border. She had no contact information for Hernandez's daughters. The Honduran lawyer took three trips over weeks to a gang-ridden town in northern Honduras near the city of San Pedro Sula. She traveled only during the day to be safe.  Hernandez arrives home with her shopping. Thanks in part to tips from local taxi drivers, she found Hernandez in March 2020. By the time she showed up on Hernandez's doorstep, manila folder in hand, the Honduran mother was so desperate to see her daughters that she was contemplating another attempt at crossing the border, this time with a migrant caravan. When Hernandez found out she could apply to rejoin her girls after Biden took office, she was overjoyed. But what followed was months of delay. "I gave all the information I could, but then time just passed and I didn't get any messages. I felt like I was never going to see my daughters again," Hernandez said.  Aron lies in a hammock at home in Honduras. Complicating her case was her petition to travel with her now 4-year-old grandson, Aron, who was in her care and would need his own passport and other permissions to leave Honduras. By October 2021, she had filed applications for "humanitarian parole" for herself and her grandson to enter the United States, her lawyers said. Approval came weeks later, in December. Then Aron came down with dengue fever, pushing back their travel date past Christmas. Finally, in early January, Hernandez was told to pack her bags, take a COVID-19 test and head for the local airport with Aron.  Hernandez and her grandson Aron wait at Houston International airport before travelling to Los Angeles. A NEW START After the two travellers landed in Los Angeles, the family made their way to Maynor's one-bedroom apartment. The girls stayed out of school the next day to help their mom with the mundane tasks of building a new life in the United States: getting a cell phone, enrolling Aron in school, looking for a bigger place to live. Under humanitarian parole in the United States, Hernandez is entitled to a work permit and is protected from deportation for three years, but she has no clear path to a permanent legal status. The Biden administration recently pulled out of settlement talks with hundreds of families who had sued the government seeking compensation for costs and suffering allegedly caused by separations. Some Republican lawmakers raised an outcry over the potential for high payouts. In 2019, however, a federal judge ruled that separated families are entitled to some mental health services at no cost.  Hernandez serves dinner to her daughter Nicole and grandson Aron as her older daughter Michelle stands in the doorway. A November 2021 study by the nonprofit Physicians for Human Rights found that parents and children forcibly separated at the border endured severe psychological trauma, including confusion and panic, depression, frequent crying and nightmares.Symptoms can linger even after reunification, the clinicians found. For Michelle, it has been hard to talk to others about what she's gone through.  Story "All the problems, I kept it to myself because it's weird telling a teacher or a friend or somebody, because maybe they will not understand you or they will just feel bad about you," she said after spending her first day with her mother. Speaking in fluent English, Michelle said she tried to be strong for kid sister Nicole who became sad when she saw other schoolchildren with their mothers.

The flour they bought months ago is running out, so food is also becoming scarce.  "We got two sacks of flour last spring which we're still using. After that, we have to have faith that God will help us," the 57-year-old told Reuters in a room lined with rice sacks to keep out the cold.  Their firewood was stolen when they left their home amid the chaos that engulfed Afghanistan in the summer, as Taliban insurgents swept towards Kabul on their way to seizing back control of the country.  Stories like Kubra's are increasingly common in a country struck by severe drought and where money has run dry.  A boy stands on a hill in Bamiyan. Before the Taliban toppled the Western-backed government in August, the economy relied heavily on foreign aid. But with the international community wary of the Islamist militant movement and the United States imposing sanctions on some of its leaders, that support has all but disappeared. The United Nations estimates nearly 23 million Afghans – about 55% of the population – are facing extreme levels of hunger, with nearly 9 million at risk of famine as winter takes hold. Life for Afghanistan's poor has always been hard; Kubra's family works on farms in the spring, earning potatoes instead of money.  Najeeb Allah, 42, a fruit seller, stands in the doorway of his shop. But it's getting worse. Vegetables like cauliflower are out of reach, and plastic sheets protect their home from the freezing weather and snow. There is so little space in the single room that Kubra sleeps at her sister's house at night. "My son used to collect pieces of scrap metal but right now he has no work," she said. 'NOTHING LEFT' Already vulnerable after months of severe drought and decades of war that forced many to flee homes for relatively stable regions like Bamiyan, Afghans are entering the unknown.  Razia, 35, stands with one of her children in front of their home. "We never used to have different kinds of food but in the past it was alright, we had rice and cooking oil," said Massouma, a 26-year-old mother of four from the neighbouring province of Maidan Wardak. "We used to cook once a day and that was good. Now it's once a week and sometimes there isn't even any bread to eat." Bamiyan is best known outside Afghanistan for imposing Buddhist sites which dominate the little market town, 20 years after the Taliban blew up the two giant statues that once looked down over the high plains. In winter it is bitterly cold, with temperatures that can drop below freezing and biting winds.  Two men walk on a snow covered road. Work slows in the cold months, but the region was already suffering since the visitors who once came for the Buddhist sites and the nearby Band-e Amir lake disappeared as the Taliban offensive reached its climax. Taliban officials say they are aware of the problems facing the poor, which they say stem partly from the effects of more than four decades of conflict and mismanagement under the previous government.  A Taliban flag is seen in front of the ruins of a 1500 year old Buddha statue. They have also repeatedly called on Washington to unblock around $9 billion in central bank assets. "We intend to ease these problems," said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. "We know what the people are facing." CASH FOR RIGHTS The crisis Afghanistan faces this winter is of a magnitude not seen for at least 20 years, when the Taliban were ousted by U.S.-backed forces and replaced by governments in Kabul who relied heavily on foreign support - both financial and military. With the former insurgents back in power the financial system is all but closed, prompting a collapse in the local afghani currency.  A Taliban fighter stands at a checkpoint near Bamiyan. The international community is looking to restore aid by pressing the Taliban to become more inclusive and ensure basic human rights including lifting restrictions keeping women and girls from work and school. Like other Taliban officials, Mujahid said the new government was slowly opening schools for girls and had promised an amnesty for former government officials.  A girl crosses a snow covered road. He also pointed to the recent appointment of Abdul Latif Nazari, a sometime Kabul university lecturer from the Hazara minority, as deputy economy minister as evidence the government was becoming more inclusive. While the wrangling continues, people like Sayed Yassin Mosawi have more immediate concerns. "In the winter, we normally borrow what we need from shops or the baker and we repay the loan after two or three months when the work starts getting better," said the market porter, whose income drops to between 30-50 afghani ($0.30-0.50) a day during the quiet winter months.  Yassin Mosawi carries a bucket to collect coal from his yard.  Story "But there have been big changes," he said. "Since the Taliban took over, there is no work, prices have gone up, people have left the country. We have nothing left."

Othman and his family have been living in a tent amidst ancient ruins at Sarjableh near the Turkish border since fleeing for their lives some 2-1/2 years ago during a government offensive in northwestern Syria.  Rocks gathered from the site anchor down their tent, one of several dozen that are sheltering families who have fled their homes during the decade-long Syrian war.  Othman stands with his children beside their tent. Their clothes hang to dry on two lines strung between the tent and an ancient stone portico. Their children clamber over the rocks and balance on walls in this unusual if dangerous playground. "In the summer, we face scorpions, snakes and dust, and all the pressures of life, and in winter the cold. The situation is desperate. There are no health services," Othman, 30, said. He said shelling forced them to flee their village near Maarat al-Numan, an area close to the frontline between government and rebel forces that has been pummelled in various bouts of conflict during Syria's decade-long conflict.  Louay Abu Al-Majd, 11, stands atop ruins in Babisqa. A father of four, he struggles to make an income, depending on seasonal work such as olive picking and any other jobs he can pick up. When there is no work, he is forced to go into debt to provide the basics. His children do not go to school. "When the last bombardment and attack began, we left to come to here," Othman said. "We did not find a place to take shelter, so we lived here among the ruins.".  Zahra Abu Khalifa, 28, cooks potatoes with her children in Babisqa. The site, an early Christian settlement with ruins dating to the 5th century, has been popular with the displaced because they do not have to pay to stay there, unlike other areas where landowners charge rent "Everyone here used to have land that we would farm and we had livelihoods in our villages and did not need anyone. But our fate was to be displaced," Othman said. "We did not leave our land by our own free will to come to an area that has been uninhabited for thousands of years."  A flock of sheep stand in a pen in Babisqa. There are some 2.8 million displaced people in northwestern Syria, with 1.7 million of them in sites for the internally displaced, the United Nations says. Not far from Sarjableh, in another corner of the northwestern province of Idlib, the ancient site of Babisqa is also providing shelter for those bombed out of their homes. In an earlier phase of the war, rebels used the site as a base, operating from ancients caves hewn from the rock where wiring installed the opposition fighters can still be seen.  A man rides a motorcycle through the archaeological site of Sarjableh. Among the 80 or so families living at the site, it is known as 'Kharrab camp', or 'Ruins camp'. Livestock farmers, they took their sheep and goats with them when they fled into rebel-held areas from territory now under Syrian government control. Today, sheep and goats feed amid the ancient stones, with poultry pecking on the ground.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko - RC21DT9PX9PB  MUMBAI, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The West has sown the seeds of a growing sanctions backlash in emerging markets. The United States designed the sweeping restrictions it slapped on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine to allow Europe to procure the energy it needs read more , and is coordinating gas deliveries to help keep the lights on. Now the White House has belatedly realised the brutal side-effects the measures are having on poorer nations.  A U.S. treasury official acknowledged the problem on Tuesday, noting allies must work together to address global food security challenges. Ukraine and Russia account for 38% of global wheat read more exports, and Russia is a major exporter of fertilisers, accounting for about one fifth of the market in some cases. Developing nations that struggled through the pandemic now face a food crisis that could destabilise their governments.  Waivers and workarounds, the traditional methods for granting relief to countries caught in diplomatic crossfire, might be less effective this time around given the sweeping scope of the sanctions and the complexity of trading links, exacerbated by logistical challenges as shippers struggle with poor security conditions and difficulties insuring themselves.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Buying in bulk is one option. Rich nations could then subsidise wheat supplies and ensure they get to vulnerable importers like Turkey, Egypt and Lebanon. India is sitting on a huge surplus and is well-placed to plug some of the gap. Australia could help too. But it’s harder to coordinate a fix for fertiliser, a shortage of which could see crop yields halve; soaring prices for natural gas, a key input, have prompted companies like Norway’s Yara (YAR.OL) to cut output. Washington might have to guarantee customers to persuade it and others, including Canada’s $56 billion Nutrien (NTR.TO), the largest producer of another type of crop nutrient, potash, to ramp up production.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, the United States was reviewing its reliance on sanctions. President Donald Trump’s administration increased the number of entities facing retaliation by a factor of ten. The side effects are starting to alienate otherwise sympathetic foreign governments the White House needs for wider global policy goals. The freezing of Russia’s foreign exchange will also encourage them to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and the American financial system. If there is too much sloppiness with sanctions, they will eventually blunt themselves.

The yacht maker is going public on Thursday despite seemingly ever worsening choppy waters: Western sanctions are hitting boat-loving Russian oligarchs; President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive has prompted the country’s own super-rich to lay low; and new Covid-19 outbreaks are depressing Chinese consumer spending and delaying initial public offerings. read more  But China's palm-tree-laden island province of Hainan is coming aboard.

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - In many ways, it’s business as usual in Washington when it comes to Beijing. The two capitals have recently squabbled over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But longer-running disputes are also still rumbling, possibly reigniting a trade war or screening U.S. investments in the People’s Republic. Whatever happens in Ukraine, economic relations look set to get worse.  Bashing Beijing continues to be a rare area of bipartisan agreement in Washington. That could turn a trade war currently locked in a stalemate hot again. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told senators on Wednesday that most attempts to get China to change its behavior haven’t worked so the government should go on the offense.  One option is another investigation similar to the one in 2017 that spurred former President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on currently about $270 billion of Chinese imports. The next probe, which could be launched later this spring, may center on Chinese President Xi Jinping’s industrial policy including his “Made in China 2025” plan, which aims to beef up the country’s expertise in sectors including electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and agricultural technology. That could lead to another round of tariffs.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Another measure being debated on Capitol Hill would, if passed, severely chill U.S. investment in China. This week, the Senate moved to reconcile its plan to boost America’s competitiveness against the People’s Republic with a version from the House of Representatives. One proposal would set up a process to screen overseas investment that targets China. While the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States scrutinizes inbound transactions for national security concerns, this would peruse outbound investments.  Such a process could choke capital flows in a broad array of critical industries including energy, chips, robotics and communications. It would have covered 43% of foreign direct investments in China from 2000 to 2019, according to the US-China Investment Project. The breadth of the plan could snag venture capital funds, joint ventures and other businesses, though there are exceptions.  China’s relations with the United States would certainly worsen if it meaningfully helped Russian President Vladimir Putin evade sanctions read more or assisted him militarily. But even if Beijing plays a neutral role, Washington already has other pressure points in the works that would intensify an economic decoupling.  Follow @GinaChon on Twitter  CONTEXT NEWS  - U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on March 30 testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on the government’s 2022 trade agenda. In her written testimony, Tai said the United States needed to “turn the page on the old playbook with China, which focused on changing its behavior.” Instead, the government’s strategy should turn to vigorously defending its economic interests against unfair Chinese policies.  - The U.S. Senate on March 28 approved its version of a plan to boost America’s competitiveness against China in advanced technologies, including semiconductors. That opens the way for the chamber to reconcile its proposal with a similar plan in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes an overseas investment screening process that targets U.S. private sector funding in China.

REUTERS/Kevin Lam  MUMBAI, March 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Singapore’s centre of gravity is shifting. The pandemic burnished its reputation as a haven for rich Asians looking to park their money. But beyond its role as a “Switzerland of the East”, entrepreneurs, executives and investors — especially from China — are looking at the tiny country as a destination for more active business investment.  The Lion City, home to 5.5 million people at the tip of the Malay peninsula, has benefited enormously from political uncertainty and pandemic pains elsewhere. Take $68 billion DBS Group (DBSM.SI), the top local lender: net new money inflows into its private bank from overseas logged an astonishing 170% increase year-on-year in the first half of 2020, and remain robust. Single-family offices in the city multiplied fivefold between 2017 and 2019, and stood at around 400 in 2020, per official estimates. All the signs suggest that pace is picking up.  Singapore is also slowly shedding its unwelcome nickname “Singa-snore”, referring to the city’s easy pace. Frustrated Western finance executives fleeing Hong Kong’s ham-fisted Covid-19 policies have started relocating to the hub, generating flattering headlines. Much more significant, however, is Singapore’s increasing attractiveness to technology firms.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The local stock exchange still struggles to attract hot initial public offerings. But that is less of a sore point now that tech champions like Grab , Sea (SE.N) and GoTo are using the city as a base to tap Southeast Asia, home to a population more than twice the United States. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Zoom (ZM.O) are ramping up for similar reasons. The International Monetary Fund’s ASEAN-5 grouping, including Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam, comprise a $3 trillion economy forecast to grow at almost 6% in 2022.  Cryptocurrency geeks are popping up too. Though regulators are being picky about approvals for licences to trade, shunning big names like Binance, they are tentatively embracing the industry with an eye on the potential of related blockchain technologies. That stands in sharp contrast to bans elsewhere. The absence of a tax on capital gains is a sweetener.  But the most striking trend, which gathered pace through the pandemic, is the scaling up of the mainland Chinese presence even as Singapore leans West diplomatically. The government ditched its famous neutrality to sanction Russia read more and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was welcomed read more in the White House on Tuesday.  Some ultra-rich Chinese may be seeking a buffer between their wealth, businesses, and the constant crackdowns from Beijing: Singapore allows family office principals with net investible assets of at least S$200 million ($147 million) to apply for permanent residence. Yet the trend also coincides with excitement about the accelerating digitisation of developing Asia, so there’s a business logic too. ByteDance’s short-video streaming app TikTok has set up shop, while the city is home to Tencent’s (0700.HK) biggest office outside of China for its global interactive entertainment operations. Chinese investment funds are coming too: Sean Tong, co-founder of Chinese private equity firm Boyu, is among the high-profile investors to have relocated.  This is a natural extension of Singapore’s $150 billion relationship with its top trading partner, facilitated by another advantage the city has over Hong Kong; in Singapore 30% of the population speaks Mandarin - the most common dialect in mainland China – as the primary language, compared to only 2% of Hong Kong residents. This is reinforcing its advantage as a place where those doing business in India, Southeast Asia and China can comingle.  Its lenders and airlines look strong too, buttressing its hub image. DBS is leading an overseas push by Singaporean banks into India, China and Taiwan, making bolt on acquisitions partly filling in a retail banking gap left in markets abandoned by Citi (C.N). And its national carrier is in strong position to support regional connectivity. Sovereign wealth fund Temasek threw Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) a first-class financial lifeline early during the pandemic; Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific (0293.HK), in contrast, is still struggling.  CHAMPAGNE PROBLEMS  Nothing complicates social relationships like success, however. While rich Singaporeans benefit from the increase in business, many nevertheless bemoan the tacky Bentleys acquired by mainland China arrivistes clogging parking lots. The cost of a large car permit has more than doubled in three years to about S$90,000 ($73,000). Rents for high-end property are soaring and slots at top private schools are growing scarce.  Among the nearly 80% of the population who live in government-developed housing, Singapore’s welcoming attitude to the monied risks driving up the overall cost of living. Headline inflation rose at 4.3% in February, its fastest pace in nine years. So while Singapore quietly courts the wealthy, it is loudly tightening up on employment visas. The government plans to raise goods and services taxes next year and is exploring ways to get more out of the wealthy.  The sustainability of Singapore’s advantage will get a more thorough test after the pandemic disruptions in Asia ease. For all the worries about immigration, the city’s population contracted a second consecutive year in the twelve months through June 2021, driven by a nearly 11% drop in non-residents. Other headwinds include crashing valuations in the tech sector and the risk that Beijing will get prickly about how the hub is helping Chinese capitalists hedge against government policies.

(AIG) headquarters seen on the day of the companyÕs 2017 annual shareholder meeting at 175 Water Street, New York, U.S., June 28, 2017.  NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It has been a long time since American International Group (AIG.N) had much to look forward to. Nearly 5,000 days since its legendary bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, that moment may finally have come, with a little help from asset management giants Blackstone (BX.N) and BlackRock (BLK.N). AIG’s life and retirement business, probably worth at least $22 billion, filed to go public on Monday. It’s a landmark in AIG’s reboot.  Successive chief executives have fought to steady the company, to clean up its businesses, and to reduce its sprawl. When the company chose current boss Peter Zaffino to succeed then-CEO Brian Duperreault in October 2020, it also unveiled a plan for the split into two companies that may now finally come to fruition by the middle of this year. That’s if market conditions for U.S. initial public offerings perk up from a dismal first quarter, the slowest in six years according to Renaissance Capital.  Private equity powerhouse Blackstone has helped crystallize the operational separation of AIG’s life and retirement division, paying $2.2 billion for a 9.9% stake last July. That arguably sets a floor for the unit’s standalone market value given its decent financial performance in 2021. Blackstone bigwig Jonathan Gray is also lending his credibility to the board of the unit, which will be renamed Corebridge Financial once it goes public.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Blackstone took on management of an initial $50 billion of the future Corebridge’s investments, an amount designed to increase each year. On Monday, AIG said investment giant BlackRock would also look after up to $90 billion of them. That further reduces the business’s reliance on the rest of the group.  AIG has been through a 14-year grind, while investors who remain from before the bailout are still massively out of pocket. In the last year, though, the company’s shares have outperformed fellow post-crisis laggard Citigroup (C.N), for example, as well as the broad S&P 500 Index.  That suggests AIG is justified in now looking firmly ahead with the IPO plan. If Zaffino and his colleagues need a talisman for how successful a spinoff can be, they need only look at two of their investment partners. BlackRock, which now manages some $10 trillion of assets, was once essentially part of Blackstone.  Follow @richardbeales1 on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

The White House is hosting Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday after the city-state backed sanctions against Russia. Lee’s visit could also include announcements on expanded U.S. economic ties, a nice carrot.  Singapore is typically neutral when it comes to global sanctions that aren’t backed by binding U.N. resolutions. That’s why a senior Biden administration official said the United States was grateful and deeply appreciated Singapore’s move to cut off read more certain Russian banks and ban exports of electronics and military products. It also stands in contrast to other allies in Asia: Biden recently described India’s read more stance as “shaky”.  The pageantry matters, particularly to smaller countries. Singapore is the first country of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to get a White House visit in Biden’s presidency. That’s a coveted photo opportunity that Lee can use to shore up his position in his region.

Under his watch, the 61 billion euro pharmaceuticals-to-agrochemicals group has handed shareholders a total return of minus 25%, mainly due to the toxic side-effects of Baumann’s $62.5 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2018. It’s time for a strategic rethink.  Investors, who will decide whether to keep Baumann in his role at a shareholder meeting in April, could have lost patience years ago. Having overpaid for Monsanto, Bayer lost more than 30 billion euros of market value in 2019 due to lawsuits from thousands of Americans who said that the U.S. firm’s Roundup weedkiller gave them cancer. A partial settlement in 2020 for a relatively modest $10 billion should thus have been a source of relief. Yet Bayer’s market value remains 32 billion euros below its pre-cancer litigation levels.  That points to deeper problems. Bayer’s Crop Science division, which makes seeds and pesticides, is likely to grow its top line 9% over the next three years, according to Refinitiv forecasts, helped by rising wheat prices due to the war in Ukraine. But that’s weedier than U.S. rival Corteva (CTVA.N), which is looking at 15% growth. And the group’s pharmaceutical division is facing the loss of up to 40% of its sales from expiring drug patents in coming years. Revenue growth is set to decline from 5% this year to less than 2% in 2025, according to Refinitiv forecasts.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The poor performance – in the last four years, Bayer shares have lagged Germany’s DAX benchmark by 45% – suggests minimal merit in keeping pharma and farming in the same barn. And the financial logic of a breakup looks compelling. The drug unit might be worth 62 billion euros on a 10 times 2022 EBITDA multiple, a discount to the sector due to its weak pipeline. On an 11 times multiple – a slight discount to Corteva – the crop sciences division could be valued at 63 billion euros. Add in 13 billion euros for its Reckitt-like (RKT.L) consumer healthcare unit, and Bayer’s enterprise value would be 138 billion euros. Take off 39 billion euros of net debt and pension liabilities, and 9 billion euros to settle Roundup claims, and its equity could be worth 90 billion euros, 29 billion euros more than its current value.  Baumann argues that keeping crop protection and drugs together will ensure Bayer’s business remains vital. The pandemic and war in Ukraine have arguably reinforced that point. Yet a breakup would create value, and give Bayer’s individual bits more focus. As the principal architect of the Monsanto deal, Baumann is hardly the right person to lead it. Waiting four years for a mega-merger to bear fruit is long enough. Bayer needs to start ploughing separate furrows.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Russia’s gold stash has some value for Moscow. Though Western sanctions have frozen a chunk of the country’s foreign exchange reserves following its invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s regime has about $140 billion of the yellow metal that is beyond the direct reach of sanctions . Using it can require complicated and risky schemes. But that also makes it difficult to track.  Putin has been shoring up his defenses against economic restrictions for years. Russia’s gold holdings have tripled since it annexed Crimea in 2014, triggering U.S. sanctions. A senior White House official last week estimated bullion makes up about 20% of the country’s central bank’s overall reserves.  To make use of the hoard, Russia would likely have to physically move gold beyond its borders. That’s why the United States and its allies last week moved to close that loophole. The Treasury Department said any transactions involving gold held by the Russian central bank is subject to existing sanctions, which means anyone who helps convert the precious metal into U.S. dollars could face penalties.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Despite those risks, some supportive or opportunistic countries may be willing to help Putin. Venezuela read more , for example, may have relied on Russia after the United States stepped up sanctions on the South American country in 2017. Opposition representative Julio Borges said last year that Russian-chartered planes picked up gold from Venezuela to be refined in Mali and then resold in the United Arab Emirates for dollars and euros.  Russia could also turn to nefarious actors. In 2020, the U.S. State Department said it was following a visit to Venezuela by the private jet of Libyan militia leader Khalifa Haftar, who was suspected of trading gold for dollars.  The usually complex schemes can take years to prosecute. U.S. courts are still examining some aspects of an alleged plot that started in 2010 and involved several Turkish entities that helped Iran evade sanctions, including turning gold into cash. The plan involved money servicers, front companies, fake humanitarian food shipments and businesses located in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Hong Kong.  The Russian rouble has fallen by more than 20% against the dollar this year, while the country is becoming economically isolated from the West. Illiquid gold could be one of Putin’s few remaining economic silver linings.

REUTERS/Aly Song - RC1CDAB1A6B0  HONG KONG, March 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Beijing’s close ties with Moscow may be rattling foreign investors. A study by the Institute of International Finance found that China has been experiencing “unprecedented” capital flight since Russia invaded Ukraine. The study found no similar outflows from other emerging markets, adding insult to injury.  China’s technocrats have only started to make progress attracting global portfolio managers long wary of the People’s Republic. While Chinese shares comprise 9% of global equity values, mainland-listed companies constituted only 2.7% of international investors’ fund allocations in 2020. Strict capital controls, unpredictable policymaking and a shareholder base dominated by day-traders put off serious financial institutions; hedge fund manager Jim Chanos once referred to Chinese markets as a “roach motel” - easy to get money in, hard to get it out.  It is now easier for money managers to repatriate funds at will, and embarrassing distortions – like arbitrary trading halts – have been fully or mostly closed. Passive index providers started to include onshore Chinese shares and bonds in their benchmarks, and international funds began steadily upping their China exposure, disregarding both the trade war and the pandemic.

Investors were already traumatized by two years of rambling crackdowns on listed companies. read more War is pushing up commodity prices, and if Beijing forces its local companies to help Russian leader Vladimir Putin evade sanctions, U.S. retaliation seems imminent. Chinese bourses are the world’s worst-performing outside Russia, with IIF data showing daily average outflows touching nearly $500 million at one point.  An exodus of pension funds and insurers who buy and hold assets for long periods of time will be painful. Although small in absolute terms, their presence helps anchor market valuations and reassure local traders, who tend to distrust local analysts and ratings agencies. State media presents global investor enthusiasm for China as endorsing its authoritarian government.  If the capital flight is sustained, it could aggravate the current selloff at a politically sensitive moment; President Xi Jinping is set to be elected to a third term later in the year. For reformers, it marks a setback in Beijing’s campaign to woo institutional money.  Reuters Graphics  Follow @petesweeneypro on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

REUTERS/Mike Blake  NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The price of gas is now nearly $6 a gallon in California, or 80% higher than it was a year ago. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing giving residents $400 per car, with a limit of two. He’s not alone, as lawmakers in multiple states are considering suspending fuel taxes or sending gas stimulus checks. They are lining the wrong pockets.  The richest quintile of the population spend over three times as much on fuel as the lowest 20%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Poorer households spend a greater chunk of their income on gas, and therefore are more likely to cut back on necessities. Writing checks, then, is slightly more equitable than trimming taxes, which favors those who use more gas.  But in general such subsidies reward those with multiple gas guzzlers, which reduces the relative appeal of electric cars, mass transit or biking. The best long-run solution to high gas prices would be a revamp of the transportation system. Shelling out state cash to prop up the use of the combustion engine works against that goal.

A poignant moment in the evening was a performance by young virtuoso violinist Illia Bondarenko who played the Ukrainian folk song "Verbovaya Doschechka" from a basement shelter in Kyiv along with 94 violinists from around the world.  Singers Emeli Sandé and Gregory Porter, violinist Nicola Benedetti as well as the gospel Kingdom Choir also performed.  Unable to attend in person, singer Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas sent their support in a video message.

"It was an incredible opportunity," Leto told Reuters in an interview.  "There are so many of these iconic Marvel characters that have already been interpreted that it's very rare you get asked to step into the shoes nowadays of a character that's never been realised before."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Released in cinemas this week, "Morbius" tells the story of Michael Morbius, an altruistic and infirm biochemist who suffers from a rare blood disease. Trying a cure, he morphs into a brutal monster with a thirst for blood but learns to harness his powers.  "In the beginning... he's very sick and frail and fragile and really at the end of his life, and he's searching for a cure to this brutal disease. And then he gets strong and powerful and then ultimately monstrous," Leto said.  Actor Jared Leto poses at the LACMA Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 6, 2021. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  "The challenge for me was digging into these three unique... versions of the same character... there's this super challenging transformation and I enjoyed that. It was rewarding."  British actor Matt Smith, known for "Doctor Who" and "The Crown", plays Morbius' lifelong friend Lucien, renamed Milo by Morbius when they were children.  "They share the same very debilitating disease and became very close as a result of it over the years," Smith said.  "They're different in personality - one's English, one's American and their souls are quite different. But their ambition to find a cure is... the great kind of similarity and the great bond that keeps them together over the years."  Director Daniel Espinosa said it is Morbius' duality that has earned him a following in the comic book world.

"CODA" became the first movie from a streaming service, Apple TV+ (AAPL.O), to win the film industry's biggest prize.  In a moment that initially looked like one of the gags that enliven the Oscars telecast, Smith strode up to the stage and delivered an open-handed slap to Rock after the presenter made a joke about the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But it swiftly became clear the moment was in fact unscripted when Smith, who had returned to his seat, exchanged words with Rock that included a twice-repeated obscenity, shocking the audience at the Dolby Theatre.  Minutes later, Smith learned he had won best actor. In his acceptance speech, he broke into tears and apologized to his fellow nominees and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences -- but not Rock.  The altercation contrasted with the feel-good moments associated with "CODA." When the movie won Oscars for best picture, best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay, nearly everyone in the audience stood and applauded in sign language.  "CODA" beat Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) contender, dark Western "The Power of the Dog," and other entries from traditional Hollywood studios.  "I really want to thank the Academy for recognizing a movie of love and family at this difficult time that we need today," producer Patrick Wachsberger said in front of the film's cast standing on stage.  Hollywood's most prestigious awards ceremony returned to all-out glitz after pandemic restrictions limited last year's event.  The mood turned somber, however, after Smith slapped Rock following the comedian's reference to the 1997 movie "G.I. Jane," in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. The comment was directed at Smith's wife, who told Billboard in December she has been battling the autoimmune disorder alopecia, which can cause hair loss and balding.  "Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me," Rock said as the audience laughed, at first thinking it was a skit.  Back in his seat, Smith shouted back, "Keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth." The comment was silenced during the live U.S. broadcast on Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ABC read more .  Smith won best actor for playing the determined father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams in "King Richard."  In his vague apology when accepting the award, he said, "Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things."  1/15 Philippe Rousselet, Fabrice Gianfermi and Patrick Wachsberger win the Oscar for Best Picture for "CODA" at the 94th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 27, 2022. REUTERS/Brian Snyder Read More  The film academy said on Twitter it "does not condone violence of any form."  Los Angeles police, without naming names, said in a statement that investigators were aware of the incident, but that "the individual involved" had so far declined to file a police report.  In other awards, Jane Campion became just the third woman in the 94-year history of the Oscars to win best director, for her "Power of the Dog."  Jessica Chastain landed the best actress award for playing TV evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in "The Eyes of Tammy Faye."  Troy Kotsur made history as the first deaf man to win an Oscar, earning best supporting actor for "CODA," which is also an acronym for "child of deaf adults." Kotsur played Frank Rossi, the father of a teenager who struggles to help her family's fishing business while pursuing her own aspirations in music.  "This is dedicated to the deaf community, the 'CODA' community and the disabled community. This is our moment," Kotsur said in a heartfelt speech delivered in sign language as he accepted the supporting actor honor.  Supporting actress went to Ariana DeBose for playing the spirited Anita, who sings "America" in Steven Spielberg's remake of "West Side Story."  The Afro-Latina actress asked the audience to imagine her as a young girl "in the back seat of a white Ford Focus."  "You see a queer, openly queer Latina, who found her strength in life through art," she said.  "So, anybody who's ever questioned your identity. Or find yourself living in the gray spaces, I promise you this: There is indeed a place for us," she added, referencing the moving song from "West Side Story."  Science-fiction epic "Dune" won the most awards of the night, earning six accolades in categories such as cinematography and editing.  Chastain, Nicole Kidman and other nominees donned a rainbow of colors for a ceremony with 2,500 attendees, a contrast to last year's pandemic-era, scaled-down ceremony in a train station.  After going three years without a host, a trio guided Sunday's ceremony: Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes.  "This year, the Oscars hired three women to host because it's cheaper than hiring one man," Schumer joked.

Klopotenko, who came from Kyiv to Lviv when Russia’s attack on Ukraine started, opened a restaurant where he offers free meals for refugees. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis  LVIV, Ukraine, March 29 (Reuters) - When Russia began its assault on Ukraine in February, Ukrainian chef Ievgen Klopotenko's gut reaction was not to pick up a gun.  His restaurant is called "Inshni", Ukrainian for "Others". Opened just over a week ago in the western city of Lviv, it serves free meals to anyone who asks for menu no. 2.  "I understood that I'm not very good with the guns ... but I know that I'm a very nice warrior with a knife," said Klopotenko, who is a household name across his country. "My aim and my mission in life is to feed the people."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  A winner of the Ukrainian version of MasterChef, Klopotenko made headlines several years ago when he campaigned to place Ukrainian borscht, a reddish beet and cabbage soup, on UNESCO's world heritage list. The Russian government contested the claim.  The restaurant's funding has come from Klopotenko's own pocket, donations and paying customers who eat from a separate menu.  Klopotenko said the majority of those eating the free meals have fled their homes in other parts of Ukraine and are making their way to Poland.  Olena Severinova, who was forced to leave her home in eastern Donetsk region due to bombardments from advancing Russian forces, has come to "Others" every day since she arrived in Lviv.  "I was forced to resettle because of the war," said the 73-year-old, crying. "Thank you to everyone for actively taking part in saving our lives ... He fed us for free."

Smith, in a post on Instagram, said his behavior at the televised ceremony was "unacceptable and inexcusable."  "I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris," Smith wrote. "I was out of line and I was wrong."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Smith strode on stage and struck Rock in the face after the comedian made a joke about the appearance of Smith's wife. Less than an hour later, Smith won best actor for his role as the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams in "King Richard."  Rock, in a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, had referenced the 1997 film "G.I. Jane" in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. It was unclear whether Rock was aware that Smith's wife has a disease that causes hair loss.  "Jokes at my expense are part of the job," Smith said on Monday, "but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally."  "I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be," he added.  Earlier Monday, the 9,900-member Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith's actions and said it was reviewing the matter.  "We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law," the academy added.  The group's conduct policy states it is "opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination" and expects members to uphold the values "of respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity."  Violations may result in suspension or expulsion from the organization, revocation of Oscars, or loss of eligibility for future awards, according to the policy.  SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents actors, called the Smith's actions "unacceptable" and said it had been in touch with the academy and broadcaster ABC "to ensure this behavior is appropriately addressed."

REUTERS/Brian Snyder  It is rare but not unprecedented for the film academy to revoke membership. Producer Harvey Weinstein was expelled in 2017 after more than three dozen women accused him of sexual assault.  In his statement, Smith also apologized to the academy, show producers, attendees, viewers, the Williams family and "my King Richard family."  Studio executives were publicly silent about Smith on Monday. The 53-year-old actor has projects in the works with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple TV+ (AAPL.O). The companies did not respond to requests for comment. read more  One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Smith has anchored lucrative film franchises such as "Independence Day" and "Men in Black." His films have grossed more than $9 billion at global box offices, according to researcher Comscore.  Oscars producers had been hoping for a memorable night on Sunday to rebound from record-low ratings during the COVID-19 pandemic. They brought in three hosts, opened the show with Beyonce and shortened some acceptance speeches.  But it was Smith's outburst that went viral, with pictures and video ricocheting across social media.  Television viewership jumped sharply this year, to an average of 15.36 million people, a 56% boost from 2021, according to preliminary estimates.  Feel-good movie "CODA" won best picture, marking a turning point in Hollywood because the film was streamed by Apple TV+ (AAPL.O) rather than debuting exclusively to theaters.  Many Hollywood celebrities denounced Smith's actions. read more  "Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did," filmmaker Rob Reiner said on Twitter.  Others supported Smith for defending his wife.  "That's what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you," comedian Tiffany Haddish told People magazine.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly  March 28 (Reuters) - A day after superstar Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock minutes before accepting the best actor Oscar at the 94th Academy Awards, Hollywood power brokers remained publicly silent even as celebrities criticized the attack on social media.  The lack of a reaction is a testament to Smith's broad popularity in Hollywood, and his powerful box office cachet, according to some observers.  On Monday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which gives out the Oscars and has 9,900 members from actors and directors to costume designers and cinematographers, condemned the attack and said it is conducting a formal review, and "will explore further action."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  These actions could include revoking Smith's Oscar or expelling him from the academy, according to the group's standards of conduct.  But Hollywood is unlikely to altogether abandon Smith, 53, one of its most bankable stars, said industry insiders.  "The current attitude, I believe, is that the studio(s) want all this to go away as if it never happened," said one seasoned Hollywood dealmaker.  Another executive predicted the controversy would blow over, noting, "He's a talented guy at the top of his game ... This will be a blip and won't matter long- or even short-term."  Smith, who apologised to Rock in a statement on social media on Monday, has anchored such lucrative film franchises as "Bad Boys," "Independence Day" and "Men in Black." His films, both live-action and animated, have grossed more than $9 billion globally, according to box office researcher Comscore. read more  The musician and actor rose to prominence as the twentysomething star of the 1990s NBC sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," a show that lasted six seasons. It helped launch his film career as an irreverent action hero, and later, his work as a producer of films and series.  Smith's producing credits include "Cobra Kai," the Netflix (NFLX.O) series inspired by the 1980s action film "The Karate Kid," and the film for which he received the lead actor Oscar, "King Richard," about the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams.  In a sign of his enduring appeal with audiences, in July 2020, Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple TV+ paid a reported $120 million for "Emancipation," an action thriller about a slave on the run from the Confederacy, and Netflix greenlit a sequel to the 2017 urban fantasy epic, "Bright," in 2018. Both star Smith.  The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced in February it would send Smith to both ends of the earth for a National Geographic series called "Pole to Pole," for its Disney+ streaming service.  Netflix, Disney and Apple did not reply to requests for comment. Kevin Mayer, co-CEO of Candle Media, the Blackstone-backed (BX.N) firm that earlier this year took a minority stake in Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's media company, Westbrook Inc, declined to comment.  Smith's influence has expanded beyond Hollywood into Silicon Valley, where he is a co-founder of venture capital firm Dreamers VC, which has invested in a long list of startups including Andreessen Horowitz-backed electric boat startup Arc Boat, social investing network Public.com, and Elon Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company.

The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has launched "disciplinary proceedings" against Will Smith after the "King Richard" star slapped presenter Chris Rock at the Oscars Sunday.  "The Board of Governors today initiated disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the academy’s standards of conduct, including inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior and compromising the integrity of the academy," a statement obtained by Fox News Digital says.  "Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, [but] we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently."  CHRIS ROCK SPOTTED FOR FIRST TIME SINCE NIGHT OF WILL SMITH'S OSCARS SLAP  Penalties from the academy range from "suspension, expulsion or other sanctions permitted by the bylaws and standards of conduct."  Many have focused on why Smith was allowed to remain seated in the front row at the Academy Awards after the incident. On Wednesday, the academy said it attempted to remove the actor from the audience.  WILL SMITH WAS ALMOST ‘REMOVED’ FROM OSCARS AFTER VIRAL CHRIS ROCK SMACK: REPORT  "Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated," the academy said. "While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently."  A representative for the academy declined to give specifics on how it tried to removed Smith. After Smith struck Rock in response to a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith, several stars, including Denzel Washington, Bradley Cooper and Tyler Perry spoke to the 53-year-old Smith.  The academy said Smith has the opportunity to defend himself in a written response before the board meets again April 18. The film academy earlier condemned Smith's onstage assault of Rock, but it used stronger language Wednesday.  "Mr. Smith’s actions at the 94th Oscars were a deeply shocking, traumatic event to witness in-person and on television," the academy said. "Mr. Rock, we apologize to you for what you experienced on our stage, and thank you for your resilience in that moment. We also apologize to our nominees, guests and viewers for what transpired during what should have been a celebratory event."  JOE ROGAN SLAMS WILL SMITH SLAPPING CHRIS ROCK AT THE OSCARS: 'IT SETS A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT'  Smith has since publicly apologized to Rock after he slapped the comedian during the Oscars Sunday evening.  "Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive," Smith wrote in part on Instagram before publicly apologizing to Rock. "I was out of line and I was wrong."  "I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.  Smith's full statement: "My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.

Question: What’s one thing that former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama have in common?  Answer: Both of President Biden’s two most immediate predecessors in the White House suffered from negative poll numbers on the eve of their first midterm elections in office and both saw their party lose control of the House of Representatives.  In November 2010, Obama’s approval rating was underwater by 4 points as the Republicans rode a powerful Tea Party fueled red wave to flip the House with a massive 63-seat net gain, the largest shift of seats in more than 60 years.  WITH 7 MONTHS TO GO, GOP HAS UPPER HAND IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS: POLLS  Fast-forward eight years and Trump’s approval rating was underwater by nearly 10 points on the eve of the 2018 midterms, when the Democrats stormed back to reclaim the House majority thanks to a 41-seat pickup.  Fast-forward again four years to present day and Biden finds himself in similar negative territory.  The president stands at 45% approval and 54% disapproval in the latest Fox News national poll, and average all the most recent surveys gauging Biden’s standing that was compiled by Real Clear Politics puts him at 41%-53%.  HIGHER INTEREST RATES GIVE GOP EDGE IN MIDTERMS: FOX NEWS POLL  Midterm elections are often a referendum on the president and his record in office, and the presidential approval rating has long been a key barometer ahead of midterm contests. And that spells trouble for Democrats, who are trying to defend their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate in November’s elections.  With just over seven months to go until Americans vote, Fox News reached out to some Democratic strategists and consultants for their advice on how the president can pump up his numbers to help his party at the ballot box.  Longtime Democratic consultant Bill Burton pinpointed a messaging problem for the president, telling Fox News that "President Biden has been a transformative leader at a crucial time for our country and almost no Americans know it."  "Getting the word out there about what the president did to lift up the economy and get our country out of the depths of the coronavirus pandemic is really important," Burton, a veteran of Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and the Obama White House, emphasized.  CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS  Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News that Biden "should get out to places with the most important races and sell, sell, sell."  The number of Americans filing jobless claims plunged last week to their lowest levels in more than half a century, and wages are soaring. But the extremely positive economic metrics are being vastly overshadowed by skyrocketing inflation, including historically high gas prices.  Moyer, a veteran of numerous Democratic presidential and statewide campaigns, emphasized that "the president should do everything he can to bring gas prices down, which could include a federal gas tax holiday."  Longtime Democratic consultant Jesse Ferguson offered that "there's clear evidence that the economy’s getting back up off the mat and Democrats have to be relentless in telling that story. When people can get jobs if they want and get paid more if they work, it's clear we can tell the story of an economy that's not yet fixed, but no longer floundering."  INFLATION TRUMPS JOB CREATION: WHY BIDEN CAN'T CATCH A BREAK IN THE POLLS  "As much as people feel very real anxiety, they have to see that Democrats are stabilizing things while Republicans would make the worst fears of this anxiety come true," Ferguson, who served multiple tours of duty at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, emphasized. "Democrats can't promise lullabies, but just show that people can get a good night's sleep again while Republicans would bring all their nightmares to life."  Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid 50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August in the wake of Biden's much criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and following a surge in COVID-19 cases last summer among mainly unvaccinated people due to the Delta variant.  2021: THE YEAR THAT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATINGS SLOWLY SANK UNDERWATER  The plunge in the president's approval, which continued last autumn and into the winter, was also heavily fueled by the jump in consumer prices and to a lesser degree the surge over the past year of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the southern border with Mexico.  There’s continued cause for concern once you get past the top lines in the surveys. Biden's approval on most major issues – including the economy – are also well underwater, and he’s seen deterioration with key voting blocs that helped to put him in the White House in the 2020 election.  "Who knows what the world looks like come the fall, but we should expect the economy and getting inflation under control will still be top of mind for voters," Lucas Meyer, a New Hampshire based Democratic consultant and activist, noted.  CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2022 MIDTERMS  Meyer suggested spotlighting a new proposal by the president that was unveiled Monday in the administration’s 2023 budget blueprint to tax America’s billionaires, saying "it can help the Democrats get on the offensive to address both issues."  "This would only apply to a small fraction of people whose household wealth exceeds $100 million, and most of the revenue would come from Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg. This is entirely a commonsense and very popular proposal that simply asks the super-wealthy - whose wealth has ballooned during the pandemic mind you - to pay a tax rate closer to what firefighters, teachers, nurses, and small business owners pay," Meyer noted.  California based progressive consultant Michael Cesaro pointed to Biden’s March 1 State of the Union Address – which was dominated by Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine - and worried that "Democrats are in trouble of the State of the Union is a prelude to what we as Democrats are going to focus on."  Cesaro, a veteran of the 2008 Obama campaign, Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential run, and now-Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 White House bid, suggested that the president "kick off the election season by bringing non legacy organizations together that focus on criminal justice, voter rights, education, health care and reproductive justice. And ask them what he can do for them."  And he urged Biden to "stop pandering to inside the beltway organizations who have little influence in electoral politics and for the love of god, back slowly away from the White male rural only strategy or else we are going to lose in 2022 and 2024."  But Cesaro also emphasized that the president can’t fumble the ball overseas."

The president laid out the tax hikes as part of his $5.8 trillion budget blueprint for federal spending in fiscal 2023, which begins in October. Under his proposal, taxes would rise by $2.5 trillion, marking the largest increase in history in dollar terms. The deficit would be $1.15 trillion.  THESE STATES ROLLED BACK THEIR GASOLINE TAXES. OTHERS COULD FOLLOW  The higher taxes would largely be borne by Wall Street and the top sliver of U.S. households, in the form of a steeper corporate rate, a modified wealth tax and a global minimum tax.  But one aspect of his proposal – a minimum 20% tax on the unrealized gains of U.S. households worth $100 million or more – is drawing skepticism from tax experts.  John Gimigliano, the head of federal legislative regulatory services at KPMG, told FOX Business the proposed billionaire tax is "likely to be a slow burn."  "It’s going to take substantial time for Congress to digest this proposal both intellectually and politically," he said. "It’s very difficult to find instances in the Internal Revenue Code in which Congress has chosen to tax unrealized gains – it’s almost taboo."  The so-called "Billionaire Minimum Income Tax" would raise $361 billion in revenue over 10 years and apply to the top 0.01% of households, or about 20,000 Americans. The White House said that roughly half the revenue stems from the country's 700 billionaires.  RECESSION INDICATOR FLASHES RED AS PARTS OF YIELD CURVE INVERT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2006  Under the proposal, the wealthiest Americans would be required to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, or the combination of wage income and whatever they made in unrealized gains. If a billionaire is not paying 20% on their income, they will owe a "top-up payment" that makes up the difference to meet the new minimum.  Households that are paying 20% will not be required to pay an additional tax.  Because many of the ultra-rich derive their vast wealth from the soaring value of assets like stock and property – which are not considered to be taxable income unless that individual sells – they are able to legally store their fortunes and reduce their tax liability. Under current law, a gain is only taxed if and when the owner sells the asset.  But taxing unrealized gains is a historically controversial idea that would almost certainly face legal challenges over the issue of whether the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to tax wealth.  The proposal is "challenging from an implementation and enforcement perspective," said Mallon FitzPatrick, a CFP at Robertson Stephens. He noted that similar proposals floated last year by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden were excluded from a larger spending bill lawmakers were crafting – like due to a lack of popularity.  "Congress still needs to vote and pass this ultra-wealthy tax," he said, "and there are likely many hurdles."  The concept is also relatively unpopular idea among Americans: A recent study conducted by two academics – Yale University Law School professor Zachary Liscow and University of Michigan Law School professor Edward Fox – shows that 75% of Americans oppose taxing unrealized gains.  "Though this opposition is strongest among those who are wealthier or own stocks, all demographic groups oppose taxing unsold gains by large margins," the study said.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  It appears unlikely that Biden's plan to tax billionaires and ultra-millionaires will secure enough support from Democrats to pass the Senate, where the proposal would need the support of all 50 Democrats.  Sen. Joe Manchin, the pivotal West Virginia Democrat, called the idea a "tough one."  You can’t be taxed "on things you don’t have," he said, according to Bloomberg News. "You might have it on paper. There are other ways for people to pay their fair share, and I think everyone should pay."

Jose Castillo, a current Walt Disney Company employee who is running for Congress in Florida as a Republican, told Fox News Digital that the "silent majority" of Disney employees support the parental rights law H.B. 1557 , despite the loud minority leading Disney to take a stance against the law, which critics have branded the "Don't Say Gay" law.  "There is immense pressure to tow the company line," Castillo told Fox News Digital. "However, the reality is that those drawing attention to this issue are in the minority. The Disney cast members who support the parental rights defended by HB 1557 far outnumber those who are protesting against it."  DISNEY HAS BETRAYED THE VERY VALUES THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS SUCCESS, ORTHODOX RABBIS WARN  Castillo claimed that "Disney and similar corporations listen to the loudest voices in the crowd," even though the "silent majority" of employees disagree. "That is why I am standing up for our shared conservative values; to show other conservative cast members like me that we need to speak up and stand strong."  LGBTQ employees at Disney staged a protest earlier this month in response to what they regarded as an insufficient condemnation of the Florida bill, which prohibits classroom instruction – not casual discussion – on "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" with children in third grade or younger, "or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."  Despite critics branding it a "Don't Say Gay" bill, H.B. 1557 does not ban the word "gay" in school settings. Neither does it ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. It does not require schools to notify parents if their child identifies as gay or transgender.  Disney condemned the bill in an official statement Monday.  "Florida's HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law," the statement, posted on the Walt Disney Company's Twitter page, reads. "Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to acheive that."  DISNEY'S LEFT-WING ACTIVISM CREATES ‘ENVIRONMENT OF FEAR’ THAT IS ‘DAMAGING MORALE,’ SOME WORKERS SAY  "We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country," the statement concluded.  "I think that is a terrible miscalculation because it's clear that the democratic process produced this law," Castillo told Fox News Digital. "Floridians, including Disney employees, democratically elected Florida's state House representatives and state senators, and those elected officials passed this law; and then, thank God, Governor DeSantis signed it into law."  The Disney employee claimed that the company's attack on the law "has Disney straying far away from the values that made this company the household name all Americans know and love."  He cited The Walt Disney Company's official mission statement, suggesting his employer needs to return to it.  "The mission of The Walt Disney Company is to entertain, inform and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds and innovative technologies that make ours the world's premier ‘entertainment’ company," the statement reads.

FIRST ON FOX – A coalition that represents more than 2,000 Orthodox Jewish rabbis on American public policy issues condemned The Walt Disney Company's stance against Florida H.B. 1557 , a parental rights in education bill that Democrats have branded a "Don't Say Gay" bill (despite the bill not banning the word "gay"). The rabbis said the move represents a betrayal of Disney's historic values.  "Since its founding in 1923, the Disney name has been associated with wholesome family entertainment that all Americans felt comfortable sharing with their children," Rabbi Yaakov Menken, the managing director of the Coalition for Jewish Values (CJV), said in a statement first released to Fox News Digital. "To this day, the majority of Disney films carry a rating no higher than PG. This means that historically Disney has been cognizant of the expectations of parents nationwide when it comes to the language and topics to which their children are exposed."  DISNEY EXPOSED: LEAKED VIDEOS SHOW OFFICIALS PUSHING LGBT AGENDA, SAYING DESANTIS WANTS TO ‘ERASE’ GAY KIDS  "The legislation recently signed into law in Florida is entirely consistent with the values Disney historically exemplified," Menken added. "It ensures that students in kindergarten through grade 3 are not exposed to sexually-charged material, that parents are informed regarding their children's mental, emotional, and physical health and well-being, and that parents be the ones ‘to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children.’"  He cast the bill as an enshrinement of Disney's historic values, and Disney's stated opposition to it as an attack on the very values that made Disney so successful.  "Put differently, it requires that school textbooks for primary-school children carry a G rating, just like the plurality of Disney movies," the rabbi said.  "It is tragic that an enterprise like Disney would succumb to a woke mob, commit itself to promoting alternative sexuality in its films, and fight the very set of values that made it the pre-eminent name in children's entertainment," Menken added. "We can only hope that saner heads will rapidly prevail."  DISNEY'S LEFT-WING ACTIVISM CREATES ‘ENVIRONMENT OF FEAR’ THAT IS ‘DAMAGING MORALE,’ SOME WORKERS SAY  The rabbi went on to note that Disney's move will alienate much of the Orthodox Jewish community, making them more nervous about Disney films going forward.  "The Orthodox Jewish community includes many who send children to parochial school to control the education they receive, won't watch TV, but will allow their kids to watch a Disney film," Menken noted. "Now they won't be able to trust even a G-rated Disney film to be as innocuous as it claims to be."  LGBTQ employees at Disney staged a protest earlier this month in response to what they regarded as an insufficient condemnation of the Florida bill, which prohibits classroom instruction – not casual discussion – on "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" with children in third grade or younger, "or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."

In one video, an LGBT activist accuses Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and his press secretary Christina Pushaw of trying to "erase" LGBT employees at Disney. She claimed that the governor wants "to erase you," to "criminalize your existence," and to "take your kids." The Walt Disney Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the videos.  A group of employees also urged Disney to abandon its stance against the Florida law in an open letter, urging the company to adopt a politically neutral stance.

Evercore ISI issued a protein inflation note this week projecting that most protein prices are forecasted to increase "substantially" due to the higher feed costs, with chicken breast reaching as high as 70% year-over-year in the first half of 2022.  CUSTOMERS FEEL HEAT OF INFLATION AT BBQ JOINTS  The analysis said pork and ground beef could climb as high as 20% year-over-year during the same period.  However, inflation for pricier cuts like steak is expected to level off or even drop, as consumers shift their buying patterns to more affordable products due to their budgets getting squeezed.  FUEL PRICES HITTING AMERICA'S FARMERS HARD AS SOME FEAR FOR THEIR FUTURE  Evercore's analysis showed that cost of ribeye and chicken wings could each drop by around 15% in the first half of this year.  "Chicken and hamburger prices are expected to continue rising, while steak prices will likely moderate," said David Palmer, who is a senior managing director of Evercore and leads the firm's Restaurant and Food Producers team.  The report pointed to the rising costs of grain that are used to feed livestock, such as wheat, soybeans and corn, as a significant factor contributing to increases in protein prices. Wheat, in particular, skyrocketed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  "We also note that beef is the least exposed to grain volatility (from the Russia/Ukraine war) as feed makes up roughly ¼ of production cost versus 50%+ for pork and 70-80% for chicken," Palmer told FOX Business.

In just the past month, liberal media networks such as MSNBC and CNN, as well as newspapers like Forbes and The Washington Post, expressed concern that President Biden was not seeing a bump in his poll numbers or receiving credit for his response to Ukraine and his impact on the "roaring" U.S. economy.  MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, on multiple occasions, attempted to paint Biden’s handling of the economy in a positive light despite record inflation, sky-high gas prices and poor poll numbers for the president.  During a March 1 segment on MSNBC, Todd pointed to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll which indicated 51% of registered voters believed the U.S. economy was in a recession or a depression. He also made note of a Washington Post/ABC News poll in which 75% of polled adults viewed the economy as not so good or poor.  CNN’S JOHN HARWOOD ROASTED FOR CLAIMING THERE IS ‘ZERO EVIDENCE’ TYING BIDEN TO HIS SON’S WRONGDOINGS  Todd immediately defended Biden, claiming that Americans’ views of the Biden economy "do not reflect the job gains or GDP growth" that have been touted by the administration. Moments later, Todd claimed it has "never been easier to get a job."  After speaking with a panel of guests, Todd circled back to the polls and became visibly frustrated at the idea Americans believe the country is in a recession or depression.  "It’s just not true. This economy’s frustrating. This economy with COVID has been—I’ve got money and I can’t find something. But my God, there’s jobs, there’s good jobs," Todd said as he slammed his hands on the table.  Less than three weeks later, Todd on NBC’s "Meet the Press" wondered if Biden was being hurt politically because he wasn’t getting a "little bit of an afterglow" in the polls from making good on his promise to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court.  On Monday, MSNBC’s "11th Hour" host Stephanie Ruhle looked to provide "context" and "facts" to her audience when she appeared stumped as to why Biden wasn’t receiving credit for his "wins."  NBC'S YAMICHE ALCINDOR: WH HAS 'MESSAGING ISSUE' WHEN POLL SHOWS VOTERS BLAME BIDEN, NOT PUTIN, FOR INFLATION  After reading an "alarming" statistic that Biden’s job approval rating had fallen to the lowest level of his presidency, Ruhle boasted about Biden’s Ukraine response before moving on to the state of the economy.  "….while inflation here at home is still a big problem, jobless rates are the lowest that they have been in more than 50 years, and the American people recover from COVID-19, so does our economy. But, that is not translating to the American vote," Ruhle said.  Ruhle then asked MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes why Biden was not "reaping … the benefits" in the polls.  "These are big wins," she added before allowing Sykes a response.  Earlier in March following Biden’s State of the Union, Ruhle said the president "needs to do more talking" about his "economic wins" in order to ensure Democrats are not defeated in the midterms. Earlier in the night, she complained about Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, R., talking about inflation and quickly moved the discussion to claim that Biden had created 6.5 million U.S. jobs.  On March 15, MSNBC guest host Garrett Haake also wondered why Biden had not seen improvement in his poll numbers despite his "popular" stance on Russia's invasion into Ukraine.  "President Biden’s not getting a Zelenskyy bounce. And when you look at the polling, it’s kind of fascinating," Haake said at the time.  MSNBC LAMENTS BIDEN HAS LOW APPROVAL RATING 'DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMY’  Over on CNN, anchor Jake Tapper said that "one of the problems" Biden has is that he’s not getting credit for "even the things the public likes."  "It’s just a fact," Tapper added.  Biden’s handling of the economy versus public perception is a topic that digital print and newspapers also seemed adamant about defending the president on.  MNSBC posted a tweet on Tuesday that stated Biden’s approval rating had fallen to the lowest level of his presidency despite a "booming economy."  During a White House press briefing at the beginning of March, Washington Post reporter Annie Linskey posed this question to Economic Advisers Council Chair Cecilia Rose: "Given the good news that you've mentioned and the trendlines that have been very, very positive, why do you think this president is not getting credit from voters on – for steering the economy in the right direction?"  Multiple other newspapers also printed pieces of a similar sentiment.  At the end of February, Bloomberg published a piece by Nancy Cook and Katie Dmitrieva headlined, "Inflation Pain Means Biden Gets No Credit for Roaring Economy."  Politico published a similarly titled article with the headline, "Biden's mounting midterm threat: Inflation angst outweighing historic job growth."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  While the article admits towards its conclusion that Biden’s polling on the economy is "almost universally awful," the piece also offered the administration pieces of advice on how to change public perceptions, such as pointing to the "remarkably resilient performance" on Wall Street as a symbol of corporate and investor "trust in Biden’s leadership."

A Pennsylvania woman born in Ukraine — who has been raising money and collecting critical supplies for her native country as the Russia-Ukraine war rages — is strongly advising others to make sure they know exactly to whom and where they're sending relief donations.  She has good reason to warn others: She herself was scammed while trying to do good.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Lesya Jurgovsky, who has lived in the U.S. since 2004 and who served in the U.S. Army from 2009-2017, told Fox News Digital she discovered someone had created a fake Instagram account in her name.  Under any circumstances, this would be very concerning — yet there was an extra layer of deceit.  Jorgovsky has been raising money and collecting supplies for people in her embattled homeland. Whoever created the fake account was impersonating Jorgovsky in an effort to obtain donations directly from her loved ones, she said.  Jorgovsky said she suspects the money was to be kept by whomever was impersonating her.  "I don't feel protected on Facebook."  While Jorgovsky is still holding private fundraisers for Ukraine, she decided to move all of her other fundraising efforts off social media, now that she's discovered the fraudulent account.  "I don't feel protected on Facebook," she said in regard to collecting money via the platform.  UKRAINIAN BAKER WHO RAISED $150K FOR HER HOME COUNTRY HELPS FAMILY REACH SAFETY AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR  Fox News Digital reached out to Meta, formerly known as Facebook, Inc., which also owns Instagram, for comment.  Jorgovsky said she reported the fake account to Facebook and Instagram, but she hasn't yet received a response. While Jorgovsky was speaking with Fox News Digital, the fake account was still active.  "My friends are still receiving weird messages from Instagram," she said.  "I never had an Instagram account."  Jurgovsky first became aware of the fake account after her friends contacted her saying that they'd received strange messages from an account that used her name on Instagram.  Initially, those friends thought Jurgovsky had made an Instagram page and that someone had hacked it.  But "I never had an Instagram account," Jurgovsky said.  Jurgovsky moved there to the U.S. in 2004. During her time in the U.S. Army, from 2009 to 2017, she worked in vehicle maintenance. After that, she settled in Pittsburgh with her husband.  With war tearing across her native land, Jurgovky raised nearly $5,000 using the Facebook charitable giving platform. She's also helped send money and supplies to Ukrainian orphanages and to the country's army.  The needs are great: The United Nations Children's Fund said that two million children have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, Fox News reported on March 30. Also, UNICEF estimates that more than 2.5 million children have been internally displaced inside of Ukraine.  After discovering the fake account, Lesya Jorgovsky decided to move the money off the Facebook platform.  Overall, the U.N. believes more than 4 million people have fled Ukraine during the conflict so far.  Aside from money, Jurgovsky has sent first aid kits, water backpacks, sleeping bags, batteries and chargers.  CONTRIBUTIONS EXCEED $12 MILLION FOR FOX CORP'S SUPPORT OF RED CROSS IN UKRAINE  After discovering the fake account, however, she decided to move all the money off Facebook.  "My advice is to donate to people you know. If you don't know someone, go to a church."  Recently, Jurgovsky announced on Facebook that she's planning an in-person Easter egg painting event in collaboration with her local church. Half the money collected from participation fees will go to support the people of Ukraine, she said.  While she still uses social media to help build awareness, any money she raises for Ukrainians now goes directly into a bank account that she herself controls.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  Fox News Digital reached out to the Better Business Bureau for insight about online fundraising and best practices. Sandra Guile of the BBB shared tips for how people can protect themselves when donating online to charities or fundraisers.  "Before clicking the donate button, only give to groups you personally know or have a connection to," Guile said. "Read everything there is to know about the organization hosting the fundraiser and ask questions," she advised.  Those questions include, she said, "Where is the money going? How will the funds be used?"  Since the war in Ukraine began, the BBB has warned of potential scams. Not only do fraudsters steal money from well-intentioned people, they also prevent funds from getting to the people who actually need the help.  Those looking to donate should check out Give.org for information about various relief programs, the BBB advised. The bureau also notes that it's important to do research even before donating to established organizations.  "We are working around the clock to protect you, our donors, and fundraiser organizers, to ensure all fundraising efforts are in compliance."  American crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, which has raised over $50 million related to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, announced on its website that every fundraiser related to Ukraine is reviewed to ensure funds are delivered to the correct recipients.  "We’re also verifying that donors and organizers are acting in compliance with U.S. and international laws, including global financial laws and regulations and evolving economic sanctions," the company wrote.  On its frequently asked questions page, GoFundMe addressed the Ukraine crisis — noting that moving money during a war "involves specific compliance checks."  ROSARIES FOR UKRAINE ARE ‘INCREDIBLE’ GIFT OF FAITH, PRAYER  "We are working around the clock to protect you, our donors, and fundraiser organizers, to ensure all fundraising efforts are in compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, and within our Terms of Service," GoFundMe wrote online.  Jurgovsky also recommends that everyone be careful when it comes to donating through the internet.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "My advice is to donate to people you know," she said.

Jesse Watters slammed the media Wednesday, saying it covered up the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. The "Jesse Watters Primetime" host said Hunter Biden used "Joe Biden as a cash register for the family."  JESSE WATTERS: We're witnessing today one of the biggest containment operations in American history, a censorship campaign to cover up for one of the most corrupt first families in American history and to sway an election.  AUTHOR SAYS NEW YORK TIMES, TWITTER BURYING INFAMOUS LAPTOP STORY HELPED DISTRACT FROM BIDEN FAMILY CORRUPTION  Back in October of 2020, the New York Post gave us our October surprise. Damaging emails, text messages and photos of Joe Biden's son Hunter, striking up deals and raking in millions of this dirty, sketchy foreign cash when his father was vice president. Using Joe Biden as a cash register for the family, Hunter Biden was the bag man, and he put our national security at risk, at the taxpayers' expense. And when those leaks out of the Hunter laptop came out, we covered them. We brought you the facts. But the media, big tech, along with the Biden campaign and of course, the Washington Swamp, just swooped in and tried to cover it all up. Hey, they had an election to win.  But now? Hunter could be on the verge of being indicted for tax fraud and maybe money laundering and illegal lobbying. Two weeks ago, The New York Times admitted that Hunter's laptop was in fact real. This came after the media spent over a year spinning the laptop as Russia disinformation. The Washington Post at the time even called the thing, 'the Hunter Biden non scandal,' but it looks like things are changing today. In a bombshell release. The Washington Post joined The New York Times and authenticating Hunter's laptop. Not only did they acknowledge the laptop from hell is real, but they confirmed what we've been saying all along.

So you want to see how powerful the media industrial complex is? Watch how they can create something out of nothing.  And they get everyone from politicians to reporters to washed-up celebrities by buying into it blindly.  David Copperfield has nothing on them. I refer to the parental rights bill in Florida. Even righty websites call it controversial, even though the bill is only controversial because the media lied about it.  The bill bans instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The only part I found controversial is the third grade part.  FLORIDA PARENTAL RIGHTS BILL POPULAR DESPITE DEMOCRATIC ATTEMPTS TO LABEL IT ‘DON’T SAY GAY'  How about teachers of any grade staying out of your kid's private life, you power-hungry control freaks? Now like my extra nipples, the bill seems pretty benign to me. Last thing I want to talk to a kindergartner about is gender.  The second to last thing I want to do is talk to a kindergartner. And if anyone tried to teach me that stuff when I was that age, it would screw me up.  I was still in the process of figuring out the anatomy of Ken — and not the doll. The bus driver.  But if this bill upsets you. That's on you. You're weird. Seriously, are you really that passionate about kids in kindergarten learning this stuff? That spells creepy with a capital K.  Or maybe it's just one big virtue signal ratcheted up by your own intellectual laziness. See, if anyone cared to read the bill, the outrage would die and they'd have to let go of the lie.  So the media couldn't read it. And as long as they don't, they can say it bans the word gay.  It's the media's version of Jussie Smollett hoax. And frankly, making assumptions about something you haven't read isn't just dumb — it could be dangerous.  DOCTOR 1: Alrighty, sir. I didn't get a chance to read your chart just yet, but I did hear someone in the hallway say, "We have to remove your appendix and your testicles, so let's get those pants off, OK?"  DOCTOR 2: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. There's no way this chart could say that. Maybe you should read it.  DOCTOR 1: I watch "Don Lemon Tonight," OK? I think I know what I'm doing.  DOCTOR 2: And what does he know about this?  DOCTOR 1: Well, we may be doctors, but he's on TV. Grow up.  DOCTOR 2: Hmm. You do raise a good point. I guess I'll prep the patient now for surgery.  So you've seen "Don't Say Gay" in the headlines because the media won. They pushed the lie knowing their peers were too lazy to check it. They were right. And what happens? You create a mental illness caused by fake news when adults redefine hysteria as entertainment.  WANDA SYKES: We're going to have a great night tonight, and for you people in Florida, we're going to have a gay night. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.  Wow. How edgy — chanting gay in front of a live audience filled with nothing but ultra liberal Hollywood celebs. What are you going to do next? Feed a Christian to Simba and Mufasa? How about a dance number about raising the minimum wage?  So it turns out reading scripts is that the only time fiction comes out of actors' mouths. They're so pleased with themselves, like driving a Prius to their private jet.  But that's what happens in a delusion. You think you're showing the world you're the smart one when you're anything but.  Look at Disney, which claims Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to erase gay kids — an odd position from a company whose cruises actually go to countries where homosexuality is indeed erased, where being gay is actually banned.  I guess it's just cheaper to virtue-signal than act on your principles. Virtue-signaling is the only thing that's free at Disney. The magic in Magic Kingdom is how they make $10 disappear in exchange for a fountain soda.  Then there's actor Ron Perlman, who used to think for himself, but now he's let Twitter run his brain. Apparently, that's all he reads. And so here he is, going off on the bill.  RON PERLMAN: Don't say gay? Don't say, as the first two words in a sentence spoken by a political leader of a state in the United States of America? Don't say? Don't f------ say, you f------ Nazi pig? Say. First Amendment. Read about it, then run for office. You piece of s---.  Oh, I get so hot when he gets so bothered.  So clearly that is not a healthy man. That's someone infected with a mind virus that escaped from a Disney lab in Anaheim and spread by the mainstream media.  But he, too, was also a victim duped by a fiction created purely to suck people like him into a maelstrom of rage and conflict. He's what the media wants.  The more Perlmans you get, the more money you make. You addict someone to rage and he's going to need another fix every day. And with useful idiots like him, Disney won't need Goofy.  Maybe it will offset the money they lose on woke movies. Poor Perlman, he used to be in "Sons of Anarchy." Now he's just Son of Sam, a guy hearing untruths from his dog, Pluto, and lost the ability to interpret what's real.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  All he understands now is free publicity. Now in case he's watching, and I doubt it, or he wouldn't have fallen for this crap because this show is like rehab for people hooked on misinformation.  The bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, with children in third grade or younger, or "in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."  That's it. The bill doesn't ban the word gay, nor does it ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation or gender.  And teachers under this bill, they can't teach about being straight either, and that's the only group with no parades.

FOX Corporation is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross to support Red Cross's response to provide aid and resources, including water, medical supplies, housing support and more to those in Ukraine affected by the deadly and escalating Russian invasion, FOX CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced Monday.  "We are deeply saddened to witness the horrific devastation and humanitarian crisis occurring in Ukraine," Murdoch wrote in a letter to employees. "Scenes of families fleeing from their homes and the loss of innocent lives are difficult to watch and beyond tragic."  FOX has also set up a site for our viewers who are interested in joining our support of the American Red Cross’ Ukraine relief efforts. To donate, please visit FOX's Red Cross page or scan the QR code below. Contributions have now exceeded $12 million.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US IMPOSED A NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE?  Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 shortly after President Vladimir Putin signed decrees to recognize the independence of separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and described the Ukrainian government as illegitimate.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , who has remained in Ukraine to help defend his homeland, requested more lethal aid from the U.S. last week in a meeting with American lawmakers, and has asked U.S. leaders and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country.  The fighting is getting "a lot" closer to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst said Monday night on "Hannity."

While the civilized world is revolted by Vladimir Putin’s atrocities in Ukraine, one person is focused on a very different matter.  Donald Trump says he wants Putin to dump dirt on Joe Biden and his family.  At a time when Putin’s forces are bombing hospitals and civilian neighborhoods and refusing to let refugees escape cities facing starvation, the former president wants him to provide oppo on a political rival–in a move stunningly reminiscent of his demand that Volodymyr Zelenskyy release negative information on Biden as a condition of getting U.S. military aid.  In an interview with journalist John Solomon, Trump raised the unproven claim that a Russian oligarch, the wife of the former Moscow mayor, gave $3.5 million to a business that Hunter Biden helped found. He called on Putin to release the information:  "I think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer. I’m sure he knows."  AMERICAN SLAPFEST: HOW WILL SMITH REFLECTS A SMACKDOWN CULTURE  Trump, who also asked Moscow to find Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails ("Russia, if you’re listening"), just confirmed his detractors’ complaint that he cares mainly about his own political prospects, in this case rather than ripping the "genius" who is committing war crimes.  Figuring out Putin is a much broader challenge. The conventional wisdom is that he’s become unhinged by his burning desire to rebuild the Soviet empire, isn’t listening to his own advisers, and massively miscalculated that his military could quickly conquer Ukraine.  His military’s performance has been abysmal, with heavy casualties, strategic blunders and outdated equipment, and morale is so low that at least in one instance soldiers used a tank to run over a commander and kill him.  With the ground assault stalled, that has forced Putin to rely on long-range missiles to inflict enough pain on Ukrainians that they might surrender on favorable terms.  But what if Putin is crazy like a fox?  In his New York Times column, Bret Stephens floats a theory that Putin may have plotted this precise scenario and the West may be playing into his hands:  "Suppose for a moment that Putin never intended to conquer all of Ukraine: that, from the beginning, his real targets were the energy riches of Ukraine’s east, which contain Europe’s second-largest known reserves of natural gas."  Combine that with Putin having seized Crimea’s offshore energy fields and the gas reserves in the eastern provinces, "and the shape of Putin’s ambitions become [sic] clear. He’s less interested in reuniting the Russian-speaking world than he is in securing Russia’s energy dominance."  WHY BIDEN'S SHOT AT PUTIN BADLY BOOMERANGED  Maybe that wasn’t the original goal. Maybe it’s a Plan B. But it does make you think about Putin’s horrifying conduct in a different way. The media has concluded that the invasion has been a disaster for the former KGB agent; it certainly has been for his country. But if he achieves these goals–and the U.S. and NATO drop the sanctions after a peace deal–that’s at least a partial Putin victory.  In The Atlantic, Eliot Cohen, a Bush-era State Department counselor, says the West should promise only limited sanctions relief for the Kremlin. "For Western powers to accept, let alone advocate for, anything less than what Ukrainians are willing to accept is unthinkable, even by way of an interim settlement."  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES  One thing we know for sure is that Putin tells outrageous lies every day, starting with declaring the invasion a peacekeeping mission. In recent days, Moscow has signaled that it would stop its assault on such cities as Kyiv and concentrate on the eastern region. So, of course, Russia continued the aerial bombardment of the cities and isn’t allowing safe passage to refugees from such places as Mariupol. That makes the earlier pronouncement–indeed, the latest round of "peace" talks –a sham to buy time to reposition his forces.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Maybe it even buys Putin enough time to tick off Joe Biden by putting out information on his son.

"We want to make sure that these counterparts overseas have the resources and we're supporting them to make them a safer nation," Larry Cosme, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told Fox News.  FLEOA is the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan federal law enforcement association in the country. Cosme says his organization is working with federal and local partners to get the equipment to Ukraine as soon as possible.  UKRAINIAN SOLDIER WHO TOLD OFF RUSSIAN WARSHIP RECEIVES MEDAL FOR COURAGE  "It's an overwhelming response. We can't keep up with the pace of the amount of equipment we are receiving," Cosme said.  Cosme says body armor, including helmets, vests and goggles, are being donated. Medical supplies and boots are also on the list. Weapons are not legally allowed to be transferred. The donations come from the personal collection of members of the law enforcement community.  UKRAINE HAS 'GREAT' NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN AID: VERARDO  FLEOA is working with Blue to Blue & Yellow, based in New Jersey, to transfer the donations overseas. The gear then goes to the Ukraine American Coordinating Council and to the Return Alive Foundation, which then gets it to Ukrainian citizens.

Ukraine’s chief negotiator in the ongoing peace talks with Russia said Wednesday that Kyiv will only sign an agreement once all Russian forces have completely withdrawn.  "When we reach the conditional signing of the agreement, or at least the point when it can be seriously discussed, they will have to withdraw completely. And only then will we sit down to sign, endorse or initial it," David Arakhamia, head of Ukraine’s delegation and negotiating team, said during an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet.  "At the negotiations, we talk[ed] about the return of their troops to their positions as of Feb. 23 this year. As long as they remain in the territories they've occupied after Feb. 23, there can be no agreements of any kind," he added.    RUSSIA CLAIMS LITTLE ACCOMPLISHED IN PEACE TALKS WITH UKRAINE  Ukrainian and Russian negotiators adjourned talks in Turkey Tuesday to discuss demands on both sides with their corresponding governments.  Arakhamia on Tuesday proposed an "international mechanism" that would establish security guarantees to dissuade Moscow or other aggressors from future invasions.  Ukraine has called for the proposal to be signed by all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, including the U.S., U.K., France, China and Russia, who would agree to defend Kyiv should it be attacked in the future.  Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel have also been called on to act as guarantors.  "When representatives of the guarantor countries saw where we started and then where we got in three weeks of negotiations, they became very optimistic," Arakhamia said Wednesday. "But the truth is, it's not so much us as negotiators, it's the armed forces that are doing the work for us.  "The negotiating position directly correlates with the position on the front, not the other way around. Therefore, God willing, we will have even better positions."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Since the war began nearly five weeks ago, Ukrainian forces have blocked Russian troops from taking the capital city of Kyiv, and advances have been made in pushing the invading troops back from several cities in the north and south of the war-torn nation.  Ukraine will not only be continuing its negotiations with Russia but appears to have begun negotiations with allied nations as well.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The White House said Wednesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "updated" President Biden on the ongoing negotiations with Russia, though the administration has not yet publicly announced whether it will agree to be a guarantor.  China suggested it was on board with Ukraine's proposal for an "international mechanism" to address its security concerns and said, "We are ready to work with the rest of the international community to uphold common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and support the establishment of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism."

President Biden promised Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy an additional $500 million in aid during their nearly one-hour phone conversation Wednesday, the White House confirmed.  The call between the leaders of the U.S. and Ukraine lasted from approximately 11:08 a.m. to 12:03 p.m. EST, and afterward both parties revealed what was discussed.  Biden informed Zelenskyy "that the United States intends to provide the Ukrainian government with $500 million in direct budgetary aid," according to the White House.  PUTIN OUTRAGED BY ZELENSKYY NOTE DELIVERED BY RUSSIAN OLIGARCH ABRAMOVICH: ‘TELL HIM I WILL THRASH THEM’  The White House later clarified to Fox News that the $500 million was new funding. It comes in addition to the $800 million in security assistance announced by the White House on March 16, which brought the total committed to Ukraine in that past week alone to $1 billion. As of Wednesday, the U.S. has now allocated a total of $2.5 billion in funding for Ukraine since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  According to the White House, Biden spoke to Zelenskyy "about the ongoing work by the United States and its allies and partners to deliver military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and to impose severe costs on Russia for its brutal aggression against Ukraine."  "The leaders discussed how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country," a White House readout said. "Biden also reviewed the additional sanctions and humanitarian assistance announced last week. President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on the status of Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia."  Zelenskyy tweeted that he finished the call, revealing that he "shared assessment of the situation on the battlefield and at the negotiating table" and "talked about specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, macro-financial and humanitarian aid."  The call came after Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul, Turkey Tuesday for the first in-person discussion in nearly three weeks as the situation on the ground changed to a war of attrition.  Russia’ deputy minister of defense told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that Russian forces would withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv to establish goodwill during the talks, but defense experts warned Fox News that Moscow was simply buying time to reorganize its troops. Russian forces continued their shelling overnight of several Ukrainian cities. By Wednesday, the defense ministry announced it would "resume" offensive operations, meaning forward movement on the ground.  Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that Russian units have been "repositioning" around Kyiv in the past 24 hours and also have been moving north into Belarus, noting that the Russians themselves have said they are going to prioritize eastern Ukraine in the Donbas region.  Kirby also spoke about U.S. European Command Commander Gen. Tod Walters’ testimony before Congress Tuesday, saying that some 100 kamikaze switchblade drones promised by Biden have been delayed. In an interview with Stuart Varney, Kirby blamed "inventory" and "modality" issues, saying he’s expecting shipments of the tactical unmanned systems to arrive in Ukraine "relatively soon."

An additional 2.5 million children are displaced within the country, as 60% of children in Ukraine have been forced from their homes as attacks on urban areas continue.  More than 1.1 million children have arrived in Poland, with hundreds of thousands also arriving in Romania, Moldova, Hungary Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented more than 100 children killed and 134 injured during the conflict, though the true tolls are expected to be much higher.

While the eyes of the world focus on the suffering of Ukraine and the threat of war between nuclear powers, Big Tech oligarchs have quietly been scrubbing their platforms of content they consider to be "misinformation." While Russian President Vladimir Putin tramples on the rights of free Ukrainians and cracks down on dissent within Russia, Silicon Valley elites are using the same playbook to stifle the free exchange of thoughts and ideas here in the United States.  Ironic, isn’t it?  Last week, the American Conservative Union, where I serve as chairman and which hosts the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), discovered that YouTube had once again banned President Donald Trump’s 2022 CPAC speech from its platform.  SARA CARTER: CPAC'S 'AWAKE, NOT WOKE' THEME HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF BIG TECH HYPOCRISY  The liberal cowards who run America’s Big Tech companies and serve as online hall monitors on behalf of the globalist establishment have silenced President Trump in the past. He repeatedly exposed the dangers their Marxist ideology poses to the country, and his ability to speak directly to the people threatened their planned socialist takeover of America.  What makes this latest affront to freedom of speech so heinous is that YouTube not only removed a video from President Trump—which is in and of itself a craven move by Big Tech censors scared of political debate—but an entire slate of speakers and panels. Almost half of CPAC’s main stage presentations were wiped from YouTube. The entirety of speeches given on Saturday, Feb. 26th have vanished.  The cowardice of attempting to silence an entire conference is pathetic, but their justification for doing so is insidiously lazy.  CPAC CHAIRMAN MATT SCHLAPP WELCOMES LIBERAL MEDIA AT ANNUAL EVENT, BUT QUIT ASKING HIM ABOUT MITT ROMNEY  When YouTube Policy Communications Manager Ivy Choi, was asked to comment on this by the Washington Examiner, she stated that, "We removed content from the CPAC channel for violating our election integrity policy."  What a load of bull.  The questions surrounding the way the 2020 election was conducted will not go away, despite the best hopes and wishes of Big Tech executives.  The cowardice of attempting to silence an entire conference is pathetic, but their justification for doing so is insidiously lazy.  Our organization has challenged, and will continue to challenge, any and all attempts to undermine election security.  GAS CRISIS: ALASKA GOVERNOR SAYS 'BIDEN IS SEARCHING FOR OIL ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET EXCEPT AT HOME'  We continue to believe that common sense voter ID laws and that every legal voter voting once, in person if able, is imperative to restoring trust in our elections.  President Trump correctly and rightfully detailed how Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg dumped nearly half a billion of his Zuckerbucks into left-wing political groups to "fortify" nationwide mail-in voting, ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting ahead of the 2020 election. All of it clearly ripe for fraud and abuse, as has been noted by the bipartisan Carter-Baker report.  However, most of the content from CPAC 2022 that was cancelled by YouTube had nothing to do with election security or the crazy notion that one citizen should cast one secure vote.  To censor the diverse variety of speakers and topics featured at CPAC this year under the broad brush of "election integrity" is a malicious lie from YouTube and a bold move to bend its user policies to target one specific political group.  next Image 1 of 6  prev next Image 2 of 6  prev next Image 3 of 6  prev next Image 4 of 6  prev next Image 5 of 6  prev Image 6 of 6  How do discussions about the sanctity of life violate YouTube’s "election integrity" policies? Do radical ideas like supporting the Constitution or reducing incarceration rates have anything to do with election security? Does calling out Putin’s thuggery violate YouTube’s terms and conditions? What about conversations about the troubling rise of anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party?  GOV. KRISTI NOEM SAYS GOP SHOULD RUN ON 'THE CONSTITUTION,' 'LIMITED GOVERNMENT' AHEAD OF 2022 MIDTERMS  Big Tech’s leftist intellectual lightweights headquartered in Silicon Valley no longer bother with debate—the free exchange of ideas and information is a problem when you’re attempting to brainwash the masses.  This is the truth behind YouTube’s lies. It’s either that or they genuinely believe that famed former football coach Lou Holtz speaking at CPAC on America and sportsmanship amounts to questions about the 2020 election.  The cowards who monitor the servers of modern America’s public squares have taken it upon themselves to decide who can and cannot speak.  Perhaps when YouTube says these conversations violate "election integrity" they really mean that they threaten Democrats’ hold over our federal government.  If "election integrity" means Democrats winning elections, CPAC certainly violates that policy—that’s our whole guiding mission.  What YouTube has done this time has prompted CPAC to reconsider its longtime laissez-faire approach to private businesses.  It has become painfully clear that a handful of Big Tech companies now control most of America’s political discourse and have abandoned their position as mere platforms.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The cowards who monitor the servers of modern America’s public squares have taken it upon themselves to decide who can and cannot speak. In doing so, they act as editorial publishers, not platforms for free speech.  If companies like YouTube and Twitter want the protections Section 230 provides for platforms versus publishers, they cannot act as both simultaneously.  CPAC will ensure that a handful of liberal billionaires cannot silence the voices within our movement. We will appropriately use our voice, our influence, and our resources to ensure that anti-American, anti-free speech oligarchs like Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Twitter’s Parag Agrawal are held accountable for their censorship.  In state capitols across the country, and in the new Republican majority on the Hill in November, we will work with legislators to ensure that one or two companies will not define our nation’s political discourse.  YouTube’s bold-faced lie about "election integrity policies" and their draconian move to silence conservative voices has crossed a line. Members of Congress I have spoken to about this agree.  We conservatives are no longer content to let these oligarchs trample on and laugh at our constitutional rights. Be it through regulatory, legislative, or legal avenues, nothing is off the table.  We rightfully call out injustice when despots like Putin silence dissenting viewpoints within his own country. Why is it any different when Silicon Valley elites do the same here at home?

In May 1988, President Ronald and Nancy Reagan made a historic trip to Moscow, in the heart of the Soviet Union. Thirty years later, when I spoke with former Reagan aides for my book, Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the fall of the Soviet Empire, they still had vivid recollections of that visit.  They remembered the warmth of the people, the desperation and courage of the refuseniks they visited, the opulence of the Grand Kremlin Palace where they met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the ubiquitous presence of KGB agents dressed up as ordinary citizens, asking propaganda-laced questions, and the hope in the eyes of the students who gathered at Moscow State University to hear the president of the United States speak.  I’ve often thought of their stories of an empire on the brink of falling, and of Reagan’s unwavering conviction that given an opportunity, people will always choose freedom. That message has new resonance today.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Reagan had come into office nearly eight years earlier an avowed enemy of the Soviet Union. He called it "the evil empire" and predicted it would be consigned to "the ash heap of history."  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  No president had ever used such strident language before. Even Nancy begged him to tone it down. He refused, and the American people were largely behind him. The post-World War II generation had lived with the Cold War threat all their lives, and they believed the Soviet Union was the biggest danger to America.  Reagan kept the heat on the Soviets in the early years of his presidency, but there seemed to be little room for progress. Then, in 1985, things changed when Mikhail Gorbachev ascended to leadership.  Gorbachev was known to have some modern ideas, such as glasnost, which introduced a new openness; and perestroika, a proposal to restructure the old Communist economic model. Reagan took Gorbachev’s measure and declared, "He’s a new kind of Soviet leader."  Reagan and Gorbachev recognized that they had one purpose in common. With nuclear arsenals poised to strike each other at the push of a button, they felt a joint obligation to try and reduce the threat of a nuclear engagement ever occurring. Whether they could manage to wade through decades of hostility to reach common ground remained to be seen. Many American foreign policy experts thought Reagan was hopelessly naïve for trying. But he went ahead with a series of summits with Gorbachev.  UKRAINE OUTLINES SECURITY DEMANDS IN TALKS WITH RUSSIA, SEEKS AIR CLOSURES, MILITARY RESPONSE FROM ALLIES  Beginning with the first summit in a lakeside chateau outside Geneva, in November 1985, the two men embarked on a years-long effort to find common ground on relieving the Cold War threat. Their summits were often tense, exhausting, and unproductive, but bit by bit they moved toward certain agreements. In the process they began to understand each other, and they even reached a fragile friendship.  Reagan would often spar with Gorbachev, who although more open than his predecessors was still faithful to the Party line. In Reykjavik, Iceland, they came to an icy standoff, with Gorbachev despairingly declaring, "I don’t know what more I could have done," and Reagan responding, "You could have said yes," before walking away.  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  It was some time before they met again, but the point is, they did meet again. They never gave up on their grand mission of preventing the likelihood of nuclear conflict.  Six months before the Reagans visited Moscow, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa came to Washington, D.C., where the leaders would sign a treaty to reduce intermediate-range nuclear weapons.  Gorbachev was hugely popular in America, even as he struggled with declining confidence back home. Americans loved Gorbachev’s western mannerisms, his smile, his fashionable wife. They liked that he called our president by his first name. He seemed to represent a new era. Riding down Connecticut Avenue at the lunch hour, Gorbachev suddenly hopped out of his car and walked, instantly mobbed by crowds of people shouting, "We love you!"  This successful visit set the stage for the Reagans’ trip to Moscow. While there, Reagan would echo Gorbachev’s populist performance, strolling through Red Square and then taking a spontaneous walk with Nancy in the Arbat neighborhood, where they too were mobbed by cheering locals. Reagan didn’t mind when rough KGB agents arrived to break up the crowd. It made his point.  With Gorbachev, Reagan always had a broader objective than just discussing nuclear arms. He often pressured the Soviet leader about human rights concerns and was particularly outspoken about the repression of the Jewish community. He never missed an opportunity to point out the differences between the two nations, speaking of freedoms in the United States that did not exist in the Soviet Union.  Though he never revealed it to Reagan, by then Gorbachev knew that the Soviet system was failing. In his 2011 book, The New Russia, Gorbachev wrote of his growing awareness of the Soviet plight: "A dead-end political situation, economic stagnation, a build-up of unresolved social problems, violation of the rights and dignity of citizens."  The modern world—the free world—was pushing against the limitations of Soviet ideology. The mighty façade was cracking as the republics under Soviet domination, including Ukraine, rebelled and demanded independence. The economy cratered as the foolish quest for dominance, epitomized by the invasion of Afghanistan, took its toll. The Soviet program of empire-building was economically unsustainable.  And the people no longer wanted to live that way. The Politburo was increasingly out of touch with the populations under its control. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell amid a popular uprising, as rebellions continued in Soviet states. Ukraine declared its sovereignty in July 1990, and seceded from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1991, in the wake of a failed coup.  On Christmas Day 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the following day the Soviet Union was dissolved.  We now know of one man who refused to accept the end of the Soviet Union—Vladimir Putin. At the time of Reagan’s visit, Putin was a young KGB operative stationed in East Germany. Over the years he came to power, often referring to the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century—and the one he’d most like to reverse.  For thirty years he has resented what he perceives as the destruction of the Russian homeland, which extends into other territories. This belief was behind his seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and it’s behind his invasion of Ukraine.  Before the invasion, Putin often declared that Russia and Ukraine were "one people," and therefore belong together. He spoke of disgruntled Russian-speaking populations within Ukraine, and he clearly believed that these groups would celebrate the Russian invasion as a liberation. Yet he has sent bombs and soldiers into those very areas, targeting civilians and destroying their homes, schools and hospitals. Pro-Russia sympathies are dissolving in the face of Putin’s brutality. Russian-speaking Ukrainians are still Ukrainians, and they are fighting back.  It’s tempting to speculate about what Reagan would say if he were alive today to witness Putin’s effort to remake the Soviet Union.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Reagan never doubted that the Soviet Union was doomed, for the simple fact that a system could not survive without freedom. He believed that its end would not come from outside aggression but from an internal collapse—which is what happened. Reagan thought the Soviet people could be seduced by the promise of self-determination and freedom, and he used his visit to Moscow to gently beckon them toward a better life. The visit culminated in a speech to a mostly young crowd at Moscow State University. There, standing beneath an enormous bust of Lenin, Reagan gazed out at a packed theater and invited them to think differently about the world and end hostilities with the West. In his warm, melodic voice, which his own countrymen knew so well, he tempted them with home truths:  I've been told that there's a popular song in your country -- perhaps you know it—whose evocative refrain asks the question, "Do the Russians want a war?"  In answer, it says: "Go ask that silence lingering in the air, above the birch and poplar there; beneath those trees the soldiers lie. Go ask my mother, ask my wife; then you will have to ask no more, 'Do the Russians want a war?' But what of your one-time allies? What of those who embraced you on the Elbe? What if we were to ask the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where America's fallen were buried far from home? What if we were to ask their mothers, sisters, and sons, do Americans want war? Ask us, too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart.  "People do not make wars; governments do. And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology. A people free to choose will always choose peace."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Reagan was confident as he spoke to the young Russians about the possibilities of freedom. He knew they were experiencing that longing, as were young people across the Soviet Union. The Cold War terrors were beginning to recede. The possibility of freedom was in the air. The Soviet Union was already falling and there was no turning back.

A new tradition has emerged in North Carolina.  After technical difficulties cut a singer's performance short a few weeks ago, the crowd at a Charlotte soccer stadium joined in and helped finish the National Anthem.  Since then, the entire crowd has continued to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the start of the games, as opposed to just listening to one singer perform.  The Charlotte FC soccer team plays its games at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C.  Last month, singer Michelle Brooks-Thompson was hired to sing the anthem during the opening ceremonies for a game against the LA Galaxy.

In response, the crowd finished the song.  Since then, singers Adam Lee Decker and Danny McHugh were set to sing the anthem. The crowd, however, decided to keep singing along.  McHugh only sang the first words of the song before switching gears and conducting the crowd as they sang the rest.  "It took me a second to process because of the tradition of everyone standing, removing their hats and listening to someone like me sing the national anthem," McHugh told the Charlotte Observer.  "It was a very novel and cool feeling of having these thousands of voices coming back at me."  He also described how the new tradition helped take the pressure off him as a performer.

A restaurateur from Utah has taken time off, so he can deliver handmade cards to Ukrainian children who have fled the war.  Dirk Astle, a Salt Lake City franchise owner of The Melting Pot – a fondue restaurant chain, felt moved to help with humanitarian relief efforts after he saw members of his church journey to the Poland-Ukraine border and all the good work they’re doing to provide aid to refugees.  "I thought I could do this, [too]," Astle wrote to Fox News Digital in an email. "I have frequent flyer miles. I have time in my schedule right now. I should go help."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  He continued, "I could not shake it from my mind. I told a few people and one good friend gave me the advice to always follow the impressions you cannot shake."  A week later, Astle booked a flight to Poland and reached out to his friend Jonathan Freedman, who is the honorary consul for Utah's Honorary Consulate of Ukraine.  Astle said he offered to transport items for Freedman during his week-long trip, and that’s when he learned that Utah’s First Lady Abby Cox launched a letter drive to share words of encouragement with Ukrainian children who have left their lives behind.  "The drawing room table at the governor’s mansion was completely flooded with letters," Astle told Fox News Digital. "I consolidated my gear into a carry-on and checked in two 50-pound bags of letters as my travel luggage. This all happened the day before I left."  In the bags were colorful cards and drawings that appear to be handcrafted by artistic children. Some were decorated with illustrations of the Ukrainian flag to signify solidarity with the country.  Astle flew to Vienna and then Kraków, a southern Polish city that’s near the border of the Czech Republic. He arrived in the country on Thursday, March 24.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  One of the bags Astle checked for his flight reportedly got misplaced in Paris, but it was luckily recovered and reunited with him three days later.  "It was actually a blessing because I didn’t have to haul both of them through the airport or through customs," Astle said.  With both bags finally in his custody, Astle then traveled about 167 miles east of his hotel to deliver the letters and other essential relief goods to refugees at the Poland-Ukraine border.  NJ WOMAN, A 'PROUD' UKRAINIAN, SELLS VARSITY SWEATER JACKETS TO SUPPORT HOME COUNTRY AMID WAR  At the border, Astle connected with United Sikhs – a global humanitarian charity that’s affiliated with the United Nations Department of Public Information.  "The group United Sikhs runs a tent immediately across the border into Poland," Astle wrote. "They are the group authorized to care for children as they come across. So, there is a large section with cots and playthings and warm food. When I told their leader about the first lady’s initiative and the letters I brought [they were] ecstatic."  Astle hand-delivered several letters to families who are sheltering at the camp.  "The children either clutched them in their hands the whole time or they very carefully stored the picture in their plastic envelope where their crucial travel documents are kept," Astle recalled. "It’s amazing."  UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'  United Sikhs plans to set up a reception table where children at the camp can "pick up a letter from a friend," Astle told Fox News Digital.

Liz Gramlich is a huge fan of Disney.  In fact, the 28-year-old from Philadelphia loves Disney so much that for her 2022 New Year’s resolution, she set a goal to visit Walt Disney World in Orlando once a month with her sister.  The pair have visited the resort in January, February and March with their latest "magical" adventure booked for April.  Gramlich, who works in inside sales, told Fox News Digital that her regular visits to Disney began in 2020. As COVID-19 hit the U.S., she and her sister started to notice that flight prices were dropping significantly.  Now, with pandemic restrictions being lifted and travel fees rising, Gramlich has gotten creative in order to cover portions of the costs.  ‘Something we bonded over’  Gramlich said she and her sister visited Disney about a dozen times over the last two years.  "I was like, ‘Why don’t we do this every month?’"  In 2020, Gramlich realized that flights to Orlando from Philadelphia were only two hours, so she'd fly out for a one-day-only visit to the theme park.  For Gramlich, it was the first time she had been to the resort since she was 3 years old.  GRANDMOTHER SURPRISED AT DISNEY’S MAGIC KINGDOM BY FAMILY FOR HER 70TH BIRTHDAY  "This was brand new to us," Gramlich told Fox News Digital.  Gramlich said the visits became "a little extra thing to bring some magic and fun to our lives with everything going on in the world right now."  "It became something that we bonded over," she added.  In January of this year, Gramlich said she had an idea: "I was like, ‘Why don’t we do this every month?’"  Saving on costs – and earning extra income  When Gramlich and her sister began visiting Disney World in the summer of 2020, the lowest price on round trip flights cost $25 from Philadelphia to Orlando.  "That was cheaper than gas for a round trip somewhere," Gramlich said.  Flight costs eventually went up to about $50 for a round trip, but that was still less expensive than the Uber or Lyft from the airport to one of the Disney World parks, Gramlich said.  MINNIE MOUSE TRADES IN HER ICONIC DRESS FOR A PANTSUIT  However, as fuel prices have increased, so have flight costs, Gramlich said. For her and her sister’s April visit, their round trip flights cost $150 each.  "That’s shocking compared to what we’ve paid in the past," Gramlich said. "So we’ve had to adjust to make sure we could cover those costs."  Gramlich said she plans her monthly visit to Disney based on when the cheapest flights are. In addition, Gramlich donates her plasma – the liquid part of blood without blood cells – up to twice a week, which helps her cover the costs of flights and hotels.  "I was like, ‘Oh, I can help somebody by donating plasma instead of doing something else.’"  Depending on when she goes, Gramlich said she makes between $500 and $1,000 per month, which varies based on a variety of factors including if there's a shortage in her area.  Gramlich said her clinic doesn’t pay for her plasma, rather she’s paid for her time. Donating takes Gramlich about 30 minutes, eight times a month.  At one time, the money Gramlich received for donating plasma covered "the entire cost of being able to go to Disney World," including flights and other expenses.  With flight costs going up, her plasma donations are still covering a major portion of the trip, but she sometimes has to save a little extra to cover a longer visit or an upgrade to a deluxe resort, she said.  "That was cheaper than gas for a round trip somewhere."  Plasma donations can benefit adults or children with cancer and people with liver or clotting factor disorders, according to the American Red Cross. It can also help someone who's suffering from burns, shock, trauma and other medical emergencies, Standford Children's Health explains on its website. "The proteins and antibodies in plasma are also used in therapies for rare chronic conditions. These include autoimmune disorders and hemophilia," the website states.  Gramlich is glad plasma donations could potentially serve a life-saving purpose.  MOTHER AND SON TAKE PHOTO IN SAME SPOT AS THEY DID IN 1971 ON DISNEY’S OPENING DAY  "When it came down to it, I was like, ‘Oh, I can help somebody by donating plasma instead of doing something else,’" she said.  She added that her donation center is clear that plasma donation shouldn’t be anyone’s main source of income, because there's never a guarantee that you can donate.  For Gramlich, she said she’s sometimes deferred from donating because her pulse is too high, "because I get a little nervous," she said.  Gramlich has other cost-saving methods, too.  The sisters also had annual passes for a time, which gave them discounts, Gramlich said. However, she added that her annual pass has expired and according to a FOX Business report from November, non-Florida residents can no longer get annual passes.  She and her sister’s day trips to Disney helped them save on hotels. Now, they’ll stay for longer – primarily over the weekends – but they split their hotel room, which is often at a value resort. They also split ridesharing costs, Gramlich said.  ‘Always keeps you coming back’  Gramlich’s recent visits to Disney World have been during the pandemic. She noted how since then, the park is constantly opening, or re-opening new attractions.  "This has just been a way… to add a little bit of magic into your life."  "Every time we go, we experience new things," Gramlich said. "There’s always new experiences that you find, and it becomes your favorite park or your favorite thing to do."  Some of Gramlich’s recent favorites at Disney World include the new Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance ride in Hollywood Studios, and the Ohana restaurant in Magic Kingdom for breakfast.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Gramlich said that her monthly visits to Disney World have offered some much-needed relief after a few difficult years.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  Gramlich said that even though she’ll be visiting Disney frequently this year, she doesn’t think she’ll get tired of it.  "Maybe we won’t go as often [as every month] after this year," she said. "But I just always feel like Disney opens up something new and gives you a new experience."  "In one Disney trip, I never feel like we experience everything that we want to experience," she added. "So it always keeps you coming back."  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS

According to research done by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, residents from the South and West Side communities in Chicago travel nearly five miles from their homes to access everyday goods and services, such as groceries and other essentials. By contrast, residents from several North Side communities travel less than two miles for the same necessities. Decades of violence, poverty and government dependency have left many South and West Siders without a full array of businesses, forcing them to spend funds on gas or public transportation.  In Pastor Corey Brooks’ South Side neighborhood, there are entire blocks of mostly boarded-up businesses or vacant lots where businesses used to exist. If there are shops open for business, their signage often looks as if it has not been updated in decades. Even McDonald’s left King Drive a long time ago. Yet, despite the urban blight, the pastor holds onto his belief that opening a "business is the magic that cures social ills" and "that capitalism, not [government] dependency, is the answer" to a better life.  To discuss this pressing economic issue facing his community, the pastor invited John Reaves, the CEO of Milton’s Craft Bakers, to a campfire chat on the 130th day of his rooftop vigil to raise funds for his Project H.O.O.D. community center. Reaves traveled all the way to Chicago from San Diego to be with the pastor.  "Tell us how you think capitalism and creating businesses can answer some of the social ills that we face, especially here on the South Side of Chicago," the pastor began.  CHICAGO MAN SHOT DEAD JUST BLOCKS FROM WRIGLEY FIELD AMONG 4 WEEKEND MURDER VICTIMS  "The way that business can help is by providing opportunity. This neighborhood, this community really needs peace and the opportunity for prosperity," Reaves began his answer. "Your team is providing skills to folks, providing an opportunity for peace and joy in their day, especially this community center that you're seeking to build."  "Absolutely."  "It's going to provide training to thousands of people, and those people are then well-equipped so they can come to work for companies around here and in other cities, and we want to be a part of that."  "When you talk about creating a peaceful environment and our center trying to help transform this neighborhood, why is it so important that from your standpoint that businesses help to anchor that, help us to create an ecosystem for creating economic base?" the pastor asked.  "It is my job as CEO to provide the economic opportunity [for these workers] to earn a great paycheck and take care of themselves and their families," Reaves answered.  "We got mom-and-pop businesses, which are important," the pastor said. "But as far as getting establishments like your company, we don't have anything like that in our neighborhood. How is it that we get companies like that to come to areas like this, or is it even possible?"  "It's absolutely possible. It starts with leadership, but honestly I think it starts with your leadership," Reaves said.  Reaves then clarified that it works both ways. The community must demonstrate that it has the human capital equipped with the right skills so that it may attract businesses hungry for good workers. The task before the pastor and his Project H.O.O.D. team is monumental but Reaves assured him that he was not alone.  "That's why I came from Southern California to be with you and to partner with you on this journey," Reaves assured. "I think what you're doing here with the community center will equip folks, and that in turn will bring businesses into this environment because they'll see the quality of the labor force that literally comes through the doors of what you're creating here."  "How can we get them to realize that, ‘Hey, there's some untapped talent here. There's some potential here, and we're willing to give you the skills. We're willing to give people the skills,’" the pastor said. "How do we get people, CEOs, to take that leap—"  "Make that investment, right?"  "Make that investment, right."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I think that will follow your success," Reaves said. "Currently, you're already equipping people with key job skills in the area of trucking and banking and other disciplines. And they're finding opportunities maybe adjacent to the neighborhood. And that model of success will build on itself and ultimately attract companies that are willing to locate here."  Reaves continued: "The challenges that this community faces are best solved by those who live here, who know the people, who care the most about it," Reaves said. "I ask everyone to join us in supporting Project H.O.O.D. You can go online and donate. It is an absolute worthy cause that's going to transform this neighborhood."  "I appreciate you, not just for tonight's support, but like you said, the support that you and your company, your family, have been giving us over time," the pastor said. "It means a lot, and I appreciate having CEOs like yourself believing that we can transform our neighborhood, that individuals are worth giving a second chance, and so I really appreciate it."

Top diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) employees at major public universities earn massive six-figure salaries for leading initiatives that some experts found to be ineffective and instead enforce a "political orthodoxy."  A review of salary data shows that the universities of Michigan, Maryland, Virginia and Illinois, plus Virginia Tech, boast some of the highest-paid DEI staffers at public universities, a Fox News review found. These institutions' top diversity employees earn salaries ranging from $329,000 to $430,000 – vastly eclipsing the average pay for the schools' full-time tenured professors.  Four of the colleges justified the DEI leaders' salaries, citing the executives' seniority and the importance of their responsibilities. The University of Illinois did not return a request for comment.  Experts identified these universities as having some of the most bloated DEI staff in the country and said they each rack up millions in costs each year.  BINGHAMTON UNIVERSITY SLAPS DOWN PROFESSOR'S 'PROGRESSIVE STACKING' SECTION OF SYLLABUS FOR 'NON WHITE FOLKS'  Jay Greene, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy, said that while the "ostensible objective" of DEI is to make college campuses more welcoming and inclusive, he doesn't believe that is the purpose of the initiatives.  "Instead, the effective purpose of diversity, equity and inclusion is to create a political orthodoxy and enforce that political orthodoxy, which fundamentally distorts the intellectual and political life on campus," Greene told Fox News.  The five schools shelling out top-shelf salaries to DEI personnel have between 71 and 163 individuals devoted to diversity efforts on campus, according to a study Greene co-authored.  'Lots and lots of tuition dollars'  Greene and James Paul, director of research at the Educational Freedom Institute, co-authored a comprehensive study of DEI bureaucracies in higher education. The pair examined 65 universities of the five "power" athletic conferences because the schools "tend to be large, public institutions chosen by many students simply because of geographic proximity," the study said.  "It's becoming almost an all-consuming priority where even large numbers of staff who don't have official responsibilities for DEI – don't have it in their job titles – are nonetheless working on it and see it as one of their top priorities," Greene told Fox News.  Mark Perry, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Michigan, also touched on this notion. He said diversity staff has expanded outside of DEI departments.  "What's happened over the last five to 10 years is its spread out in decentralized ways," Perry told Fox News. "At the University of Michigan, each college, school, or department on campus will have a diversity officer, including the library, the arboretum, school of nursing – the college of engineering at Michigan has about 10" diversity officers.  Greene said it's "shocking," given the large scale of investments, that there is "no evidence to show it's achieving its ostensible purposes of helping improve racial climate, tolerance and welfare of students."  He added that a university with an average DEI staff of 45 people – along with the costs of diversity initiatives – can involve tens of millions of dollars per year. Greene said that's a "severe undercount" since it doesn't include "all of the other efforts made by people who don't have this in their job titles."  WATCH HERE  Michigan, for instance, devoted $85 million in 2016 to diversity initiatives over a five-year period, the Detroit Free Press reported.  The efforts included a program for incoming freshmen "to help assess and then develop skills for navigating cultural and other differences," enhanced programming for new faculty members on "inclusive teaching methods," programs to recruit and retain a more diverse pool of students, faculty and staff and "an innovation grant program to catalyze new ideas from students, faculty and staff for addressing issues of diversity, equity and inclusion," the Free Press reported.  Although it's difficult to track exactly how much a college spends on salaries for DEI projects, Perry was able to tally the DEI payroll at Michigan.  He said the university injects $15 million in total compensation to DEI bureaucrats, including $11.8 million for payroll and $3.8 million in benefits. He added that universities view expanded DEI efforts as part of their academic mission.  "They're supporting that mission with lots and lots of tuition dollars," Perry said.  "It's become a very expensive part of the university's bureaucracy," he continued. "Faculty have been concerned for a long time about administrative bloat in higher education. When you look at the cost of college over the last 10, 20, 30, 40 years, college tuition fees have gone up more than any other consumer product, good or service."  Perry said that the explosion of DEI in administrative bureaucracy "is generating a huge cost to the university and ultimately then the students and their parents and taxpayers."  DEI executives raking it in  Greene's study shows that the University of Michigan has the most DEI personnel out of the universities, with 163 individuals working on such efforts as of 2021.  Robert Sellers, Michigan's vice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer, is also the highest-paid DEI official from the top 15 colleges on their list, a Fox News review of pay at the universities found.  Michigan's most recent faculty and staff disclosures reveal that Sellers earns an annual salary of nearly $431,000. According to data from the Chronicle of Higher Education, his contract is substantially more than the average salary of Michigan's full-time professors, which sits around $174,000.  "We believe Rob Sellers' pay is appropriate for the executive-level position he fills at U-M and it is in line with the salary of others with similar responsibilities," Rick Fitzgerald, the associate vice president for public affairs at Michigan, told Fox News.  "He is both a vice provost with duties well beyond diversity and the university's chief diversity officer," he continued. "As chief diversity officer, he advises the president on universitywide activities related to diversity, equity and inclusion."  Sellers is not alone in his lucrative pay. Other schools with massive staff devoted to DEI initiatives also dish out handsome paychecks to their top equity personnel.  Georgina Dodge, the vice president at the office of diversity and inclusion at the University of Maryland, which employs 71 DEI personnel, makes $358,000 a year, a database of Maryland public employees shows.  The average Maryland full-time professor salary is just over $157,000.  UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO STUDENTS DEMAND SCHOOL GIVE $1 BILLION IN REPARATIONS TO SOUTH SIDE  "Our Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion is an experienced higher education administrator, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, and a valued member of the president's leadership team," the University of Maryland's chief communications officer, Katie Lawson, told Fox News.  "She is responsible for directing the office that investigates on-campus sexual misconduct and discrimination and the office that coordinates disability accommodations, as well as leading large-scale, campuswide trainings and acadmemic [sic] support programs that serve thousands of students," Lawson said.  Menah Pratt-Clarke, vice provost for inclusion and diversity at Virginia Tech, which has 83 DEI personnel, earns over $351,000 annually, a search of a Virginia public employee pay shows.  The average Virginia Tech full-time professor salary sits at nearly $142,000.  "As a land grant institution and consistent with our teaching and research mission, Virginia Tech is committed to fostering and supporting a campus community that is welcoming to all," Virginia Tech's associate vice president for university relations, Mark Owczarski, told Fox News.  "We are grateful for the important work Dr. Pratt-Clarke, who, as a vice president and member of the president's cabinet oversees the offices of strategic affairs and diversity and inclusion, does on behalf of Virginia Tech and the commonwealth we serve," Owczarski said.  Kevin McDonald, vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Virginia, which has 94 employees devoted to DEI, makes $340,000 a year, records show.  The average Virginia full-time professor salary is nearly $175,000.  "The University of Virginia's Vice President for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Partnerships is a member of the University's Executive Leadership team who has a broad portfolio of important initiatives that span the entire institution," Brian Coy, a spokesperson for the university, told Fox News.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Our Vice President, Dr. Kevin McDonald, is a national leader in his field and we are grateful for his service to the University," Coy continued. "His pay is commensurate with other UVA senior executives who have pan-University responsibilities and it reflects the importance we place on creating an environment where people from every perspective and walk of life can live, learn, and work successfully."  Sean C. Garrick, vice chancellor for diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Illinois, which has 71 DEI employees, earns nearly $330,000 annually, salary disclosures show.  The average Illinois full-time professor salary hovers around $152,000.  Ethan Barton produced the accompanying graphic.

Rep. Jake Ellzey questioned whether a cue card with talking points that President Biden used involved collusion with the media and suggested that other people are "calling the shots."  A photo showed that Biden held a note card during a news briefing Monday. The card included prepared responses to a question asking what the president meant when he said earlier that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn’t remain in power.  "The question I have is, were those questions that he had on the note card planted by somebody else and then referred to by the media?" Ellzey, a Texas Republican, said during an interview with Fox News. "That would show collusion with the media."  WATCH NOW:  Biden has previously relied on prepared lists of reporters when taking questions from the media. He’s said he was given a list, but it’s unclear who crafted it.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I think he has a team that he relies on more than I would if I were the president," Ellzey told Fox News. "I think that there are some people calling the shots that we don't know who they are, and they need to be briefing us on what they're advising the president on what he should be doing."  The president has previously made remarks that have led critics to question if someone is giving Biden orders. In September, for example, he said he was "supposed to stop and walk out of the room" after he finished prepared remarks.  Biden said Saturday that Putin "cannot remain in power." He made the impromptu comment during a speech in Poland during which he called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a "strategic failure."  Administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, clarified that the U.S. is not seeking regime change.  Biden, echoing statements on his note card, said Monday that he was expressing outrage, rather than suggesting policy change.  Ellzey noted that politicians regularly rely on note cards to stay on message.  "Especially at the presidential level, every word that he says is going to be scrutinized, gone over by every world leader, because it has impact," Ellzey told Fox News. "He went off message, and it got him in trouble."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Ellzey added that Biden needs to "use a lot of thought before he opens his mouth" since the situation in Ukraine is so sensitive and because the president’s statements carry so much influence.  Intelligence officials have warned that Putin could turn to nuclear or chemical weapons since Ukraine has been so effective at fighting off the Russian invaders.  A Kremlin spokesperson said Biden’s comments were "alarming." French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that they weren’t helpful for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv.

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci was reluctant to blame China for lying about the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak in an interview Sunday. Despite evidence, he argued that China didn’t "necessarily cover things up."  During an interview on BBC’s "Sunday Morning," Fauci was asked what he thought about the Chinese government "preventing" World Health Organization (WHO) investigators from "seeing key details and from speaking to key people" when they tried to investigate the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.  "Why do you think the Chinese government did that?" presenter Sophie Raworth asked the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease {NIAID} director. But Fauci declined to criticize the Chinese Communist Party for hiding key information about the virus from the world before the pandemic outbreak.  "You know, I don’t want to create any or mention any disparaging remarks about that," he began.  Last June, Fauci warned the media to not "be accusatory" in blaming China for misleading about the virus's origin.  RAND PAUL SAYS FAUCI STILL STONEWALLING HIM ON GAIN-OF-FUNCTION QUESTIONS  The doctor seemed to defend and rationalize China’s behavior as well to the BBC.  "[T]he Chinese are very closed, in a way of being very reluctant, particularly when you have a disease that evolves in their country, they become extremely secretive, even though there’s no reason to be secretive," Fauci said. "I think they were very concerned and maybe embarrassed that the virus evolved from their country but there’s nothing wrong with that."    He then claimed China didn’t "necessarily" cover things up.  "So when they see something evolving in their own country, they tend to have a natural reflex of not necessarily covering things up but not being very open and transparent," he explained.    But new documents reported by Fox this month show that U.S. officials were aware China was withholding important information about the virus before the pandemic outbreak.  The correspondence was first obtained by the legal watchdog group Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News Digital the documents showed Fauci’s agency at the National Institutes of Health, "hid information on China’s failure to provide essential data on COVID-19."  ADM. GIROIR HITS BACK AT FAUCI’S COMMENTS ON COVID RESTRICTIONS: ‘ELIMINATE THIS FROM YOUR VOCABULARY’    Fauci has been criticized by Republicans for downplaying the validity of the Wuhan lab leak theory, contradicting himself on COVID information, and being reluctant to give up coronavirus restrictions.  In this same interview Sunday, he warned Americans "need to be prepared for the possibility" of COVID restrictions returning. Fauci also claimed the nation may never know if lockdowns in 2020 were "worth it" or "too severe" to stop the spread of the virus.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr. Anthony Fauci is stonewalling Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on his questions for the record regarding the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) gain-of-function research funding, the senator says.  Paul sent 11 "yes or no" questions for the record after Fauci’s explosive Jan. 11 testimony to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.  The Kentucky Republican has seen no response from Fauci since sending the questions almost three months ago, according to his office.  RAND PAUL CONTINUES PRESSING FAUCI FOR ANSWERS ON NIH GAIN-OF-FUNCTION FUNDING  "While Dr. Fauci has been MIA for the past few months, he still owes the American people answers. Following a Senate HELP Committee hearing in January, I submitted 11 ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions to the committee hearing record that aimed to get us closer to the truth about the origins of COVID-19 – we still haven’t heard back," Paul, a medical doctor, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.  "The American people deserve to know how this pandemic started, to know if the NIH funded dangerous gain-of-function research that may have caused this pandemic, and to remove from office anyone, such as Dr. Fauci, who let this happen," he continued. "Dr. Fauci can hide out for the next few months and ignore efforts to find the truth, but I can promise you, when Republicans retake the Senate and I’m chairman of a committee, he won’t be able to ignore me and the American people any longer."  While there is never a deadline for questions for the record , Fauci’s lack of response for nearly three months raises some red flags.  Paul’s questions for Fauci probed the doctor on the NIH gain-of-research funding, starting with the grant providing funds for "bat SARS-related coronaviruses to EcoHealth Alliance with a subcontract to the Wuhan Institute of Virology" (WIV).  The Kentucky Republican also asked if Fauci was "prepared to retract your previous false testimony before the" Senate HELP Committee if he answered in the affirmative to any of the 11 questions.  Paul and Fauci got into a heated exchange during the doctor’s latest appearance before the Senate HELP Committee that included personal jabs between the two officials.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Paul, a fierce critic of Fauci, accused the NIAID director of playing a role in smearing doctors from Harvard, Oxford and Stanford who had positions different from his own.  NIAID did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.  Fox News’ Ronn Blitzer contributed reporting.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly rejected a note from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeking peace in the more than a month-long conflict. When the note was hand-delivered to him by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, Putin reportedly replied instead: "Tell him I will thrash them."  The Times of London reported Monday that Abramovich, a close ally of Putin acting as Russia’s envoy to Ukrainian negotiators, last week met Putin in Moscow and presented him with a handwritten note from Zelenskyy outlining the conditions he would consider in order to reach a cease-fire agreement.  Though the newspaper did not disclose the exact contents of the alleged note, The Times said Putin’s response was unequivocally clear: "Tell him I will thrash them." Fox News has not verified the report.  RUSSIA, UKRAINE NEGOTIATORS HOLD IN-PERSON TALKS IN TURKEY AS MOSCOW SAYS IT WILL PULL BACK FROM KYIV, CHERNIHIV  Abramovich, who along with two top Ukrainian diplomats reportedly suffered a suspected poisoning in Kyiv earlier this month, was present in person Tuesday in Istanbul, Turkey, where another round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations happened for the first time in nearly three weeks.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  His exact role in the talks was unclear, as the Kremlin has stressed Abramovich is not an official member of the delegation in Istanbul but has been serving as a go-between for the Russian and Ukrainian sides.  Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Vadym Prystaiko, was critical of Abramovich’s presence at the talks hosted at the Dolmabahce Palace, commenting to the BBC on Tuesday, "I don't know if he's buying his way out somehow or if he's really useful, that's very difficult to tell."  The Wall Street Journal and Netherlands-based investigative group, Bellingcat, both reported about the suspected poisoning on Monday, saying Abramovich, Ukrainian lawmaker Rustem Umerov and another negotiator had all experienced symptoms that included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands following a March 3 meeting in Kyiv.  The reports said the conditions of the three men have since improved and their lives weren’t in danger.  But contacted by Fox News, a spokesman for Zelenskyy’s office denied reports about the poisoning, as did Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian media the reports were false and part of an "information war." Umerov tweeted, "I’m fine," Monday, warning not to trust "unverified information."  Still, BBC reported that Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said on Ukrainian TV hours before Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul that he advised colleagues not to eat or drink anything.  The Russian government has previously been accused of poisoning perceived dissenters. The Kremlin has been tied to the 2020 nerve agent attack on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia, the 2018 nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer who defected to the U.K., and his daughter Yulia, and the 2004 poisoning of pro-Western Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko, who was left permanently disfigured following the attack.  Speaking at a press conference in Morocco Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there’s "concern" of reports about the poisoning due to Russia’s "track record" with Navalny and others.  Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, has been sanctioned by the U.K. and the European Union, but the Journal previously reported that Zelenskyy asked the U.S. not to sanction Abramovich due to his role in facilitating talks and his growing interest in humanitarian issues, including potentially organizing civilian evacuations from the besieged Mariupol, so the U.S. Treasury paused plans to do so.  Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti published a photo Tuesday showing Abramovich speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at the meeting.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The BBC noted that Abramovich, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship and owns a minority stake in the steel company Evraz PLC, was seen on Turkish television coverage of the talks listening to a translation through headphones while sitting next to Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin at a separate table from the main delegations on Tuesday.  As talks were underway Tuesday, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters in Moscow that his country has agreed to "fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv" in order to "increase mutual trust for future negotiations to agree and sign a peace deal with Ukraine," according to the Financial Times. The announcement did not signal any relief, however, for the besieged cities of Odesa or Mariupol, which have suffered heavy Russian bombardment.

China will seek to strengthen ties with Russia as the U.S. and NATO allies call on Beijing to instead apply greater pressure and apply sanctions to Moscow amid the invasion of Ukraine.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday met with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Both ministers condemned the "illegal" and "counter-productive" Western sanctions imposed in reaction to the invasion.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "Both sides are more determined to develop bilateral ties, and are more confident in promoting cooperation in various fields," Wang said. "China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era under the guidance of the consensus reached by the heads of state."  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  Lavrov updated Wang on Russia’s progress of military operations in Ukraine and the current progress on negotiations with Kyiv, Reuters reported. Wang praised the relationship as having "withstood the test of international turbulence."  UKRAINE INSISTS RUSSIA MUST WITHDRAW COMPLETELY BEFORE SIGNING PEACE AGREEMENT  Russia’s foreign ministry referred to NATO allies as "satellites" of the U.S.  The relationship between China and Russia drew heavy scrutiny in the run-up to the invasion: Some experts noted that China would likely act as a backdoor for Russia in the event of sanctions from the West, with Trump’s Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Robert L.

BIDEN PROMISES ZELENSKYY ANOTHER $500M IN FUNDING IN HOUR-LONG CALL, BRINGING US AID TO UKRAINE TO $2.5  China moved to do just that with a few contracts that locked in coal and wheat agreements with Russia prior to the invasion: The two countries finalized a deal that would see China purchase 100 million tons of Russian coal only the day before Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine.  Russian news outlet TASS, which is owned by the government, reported on the deal, adding that Russia’s share of coal in the Asia-Pacific market has increased by 8% since 2010, with Russia now controlling around 12% of the market – another sign of the increasingly close relationship.

"China is kind of inciting him to go to quarrel with the West because it’s in their interest," Kozyrev argued. "If he loses the Western markets – even Japan and many other countries joined the sanctions – he will crawl to China asking them to buy some of their mineral resources."

With the war in Ukraine raging on, the country is in critical need of medical supplies. One nonprofit in the U.S. is trying to fill that void.  Project C.U.R.E. has 30,000 volunteers for its seven locations nationwide. It's been working nonstop since Russia invaded Ukraine. All equipment or supplies in the distribution centers are donations, but the journey to get these supplies to the war zone certainly isn’t easy.  Volunteers have been hard at work at the Project C.U.R.E. international headquarters and distribution center in Centennial, Colorado. Lyn Tison has been a volunteer with the organization for a year and says things have gotten much busier since Russia invaded Ukraine.  "Every little bit counts, and even though I’m not there, I still feel like I'm helping a lot," said Tison.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: LIVE UPDATES HERE  As for the logistics and shipping of medical supplies to Ukrainians in need, the timing of the war couldn’t be worse.  "Right now, it’s difficult to get an airplane or container to go anywhere anyway, and we have been postponed two or three months on the loads that we’re doing. And now there is a crisis, and we need to get going on shipping," said Douglas Jackson, Project C.U.R.E.’s president and CEO.  Once medical supplies do leave Colorado or any one of the seven Project C.U.R.E. branches scattered across the country, they have a long journey to eventually get to Ukraine.  ZELENSKYY SEEKING VOLUNTEERS, CALLS FOR ‘INTERNATIONAL’ TEAM TO FIGHT RUSSIA  From the Colorado distribution center, the supplies will travel to Chicago by truck, Chicago to Toronto by truck, Toronto to Warsaw by plane and Warsaw into Ukraine by truck.  Project C.U.R.E. partnered with Ukrainians of Colorado. Volunteer Andrij Lenec’s parents were Ukrainian immigrants, and he served in the Peace Corps in Ukraine after he retired. Lenec said when Russia invaded Ukraine, he was stunned.  "That first day, I was just in a state of shock. Knowing that people that I know, and love, and lived with, and ate with and conversed with were in danger," Lenec said.  Ukrainians of Colorado is helping coordinate requests for specific trauma and medical supplies directly from Ukraine.  UKRAINE NEWS: 1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE FLED COUNTRY AMID RUSSIAN INVASION, UNICEF SAYS  "I’m really happy to find that we’re addressing the right need at the right time," Lenec said.  Pavlo Kozenko is a Ukrainian doctor in Truskavets, a town near the city of Lviv in Western Ukraine.  "We are really thankful to the United States and other Western countries for the great support we’ve already received," said Kozenko.  AMERICANS DONATE BODY ARMOR, AMMUNITION FOR UKRAINE  Kozenko says the main equipment needed includes tourniquets to stop major bleeding, which he says is the No. 1 preventable cause of death.  "Priority No. 1 is the treatment of our soldiers and saving their lives, but also we appreciate any kind of medical, relevant medical equipment or relevant drugs which come to Ukraine," said Kozenko.  Project C.U.R.E. is giving all that it can right now, but once the supplies get close to Ukraine, things could change at a moment’s notice.

"So, what was a safe passage yesterday may not be a safe passage tomorrow and that’s part of the trick with this one."  Once medical supplies do make it to Europe, Jackson said, Project C.U.R.E. will work with organizations to move it by truck into Ukraine. Jackson says it’s going to all come down to trust.

Three premature babies have been safely transported from Ukraine to Poland as the Russia-Ukraine war continues.  Project DYNAMO, an American civilian and ally rescue nonprofit based in Tampa, launched a mission that successfully evacuated twin baby boys and one baby girl from Kyiv on Monday, March 7.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The rescue mission, which the organization is calling "GEMINI," was accomplished with help from two doctors, two neonatal specialists, one nurse and a Ukrainian ambulance crew — and comes 11 days after Russia launched its attack on Ukraine.  Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv remains an active war zone as Russian forces continue shelling. Many families have evacuated the city and country as a result.  HALF A MILLION CHILDREN BECOME REFUGEES AS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR DESTROYS HOMES AND SERVICES  In a press release, Project DYNAMO wrote that rescue volunteers report that they heard shelling "within earshot of the hospital" during their departure.  "During operational planning and execution, I was anxious because premature babies, under the best of circumstances in the best hospitals, are fragile and vulnerable," Project DYNAMO Co-founder Bryan Stern told Fox News Digital. "When we put them in a war zone surrounded by Russian artillery and troops, that presents a complicated medical situation and makes it much scarier."  "From an evacuation perspective, having to move these fragile babies through these war zones by vehicle, is wrought with peril and danger. I'm overcome with joy and happiness to be able to help the family by delivering Lenny and Moishe," Stern continued. "The Project DYNAMO team, in concert with others, all worked together to deliver these bundles of joy to two happy families. Once the operation was complete, with happy parents, I felt like a delivery room doctor introducing children to their parents for the very first time.  The babies that Project DYNAMO evacuated were transported in incubators via ambulance, which received an escort made up of the nonprofit’s volunteers.  Project DYNAMO describes its team members as "humanitarians" and says many of them are "current and former members of the U.S. military" who have experience in "special operations and intelligence communities."  FOREIGNERS WHO FLED UKRAINE AMID WAR WITH RUSSIA NOW HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME  The rescue vans traveled more than 700 miles west from Kyiv to Hospital PRO-FAMILIA in Rzeszow, Poland, where the American twin boys and the British baby girl were reunited with their families and respective national consular service providers.  Project DYNAMO reports that the GEMINI mission also led to the safe evacuation of two Ukrainian women and a British couple.  So far, the organization reports that 150 civilians have been rescued in 14 missions.  UKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'  The nonprofit has received more than 14,000 evacuation requests from people around the world in relation to the Russia-Ukraine war, including the U.S., U.K, Canada, France, Romania, Nigeria, Mexico and Afghanistan.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  Evacuation requests have also come from "citizens and residents from other European nations," Project DYNAMO wrote in its release, "many of whom include children and the elderly and members of the Jewish community in Ukraine."  Updated evacuation numbers from the United Nations state that more than two million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its attack on the country on Feb. 24, 2022.  The intergovernmental agency estimates that these evacuation numbers could potentially double.  KYIV ZOO STAFF, FAMILIES HIDE AMID RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IN 'ZOO MILITARY COMMUNE'  A Monday press release from UNICEF says "hundreds of thousands" of Ukraine evacuees are children and many of them "are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members."  As the fight between Russia and Ukraine shows no sign of slowing at this time, Project DYNAMO reports that it will continue evacuation operations.  It recommends that people in need of help submit Ukraine evacuation requests on projectdynamo.org and through the U.S. State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).

Prayer vigils and rallies for peace are being held by concerned citizens in the U.S. and around the globe as Ukraine battles the Russian invasion.  Youth groups and schools throughout the country are doing their part to send well wishes to the people directly impacted by the war and protest the clashes that were started by the Russian Armed Forces on Thursday, Feb. 24.  Anna Cirilli, the principal of the St. Nicholas Cathedral School in Chicago told Fox News Digital that students have been organizing prayer vigils to show support for family members and friends who are still in Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The students and staff continue to pray for peace for Ukraine," Cirilli said.  In a written vigil excerpt from Monday, Feb. 28, which was provided to Fox News Digital, the St. Nicholas Cathedral School prayed for the safety and protection of all those affected by the war.  "There are people that are protecting their land by fighting in the armed services, volunteer battalions, and militias. These people are heroes, they are the pride of the country for putting their lives on the line for the safety of Ukraine and for all of Europe," St. Nicholas Cathedral School vigil participants said during their prayer. "There are innocent civilians that are paying the price of a war that they did not want. Too many people have become refugees, while others remain in hiding."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  The prayer vigil participants continued their invocation by noting that families are being separated and are unsure of when they’ll be able to see each other again.  "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not new, but Ukraine is its own independent country with its own history, beliefs, culture, language, and traditions," vigil participants said.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  The Ukrainian American Youth Association – an American branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM), a patriotic and faith-based nonprofit scouting organization – has been spreading awareness about prayer vigils and peaceful protests throughout the country.  Two days before Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv, the Ukrainian American Youth Association had urged its members to contact the White House to honor the Budapest Memorandum and put sanctions on Russia on Facebook. The organization’s call to "help Ukraine" came about after weeks of tension grew between the two countries as Russia built up its military near Ukraine’s borders.  The organization’s Ohio youth chapter CYM Cleveland was one of the first to hold a "Cleveland Pray for Ukraine" event before Russia’s attack, according to a news post from the Ukrainian Youth Association website.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  Several other chapters have gone on to host prayer vigils, including the organization’s Illinois chapter CYM (AUYA) Palatine, which held an initial church service on Thursday, where members prayed for families in Ukraine at the Immaculate Conception Church.  Fox News Digital reached out to the Ukrainian American Youth Association for comment.  Outside of prayer, the organization has been keeping the public in the loop with Facebook posts about war reports and peace events that are happening in the U.S.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  On Thursday, the Ukrainian American Youth Association highlighted a "STOP PUTIN" rally in NYC.

When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us.  "It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine," explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. "The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated."  That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine . They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane.  UKRAINE APPEARS TO HAVE BEGUN SHELLING RUSSIAN TERRITORY  "The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious," wrote National Review. In other words, there's a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He's irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis.  In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this? It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential. You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us.  RUSSIA CLAIMS LITTLE ACCOMPLISHED IN PEACE TALKS WITH UKRAINE  They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. So now is the moment to ignore the people who've been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage.  Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin , just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He's devoted his life to it. In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country.  The U.S. has never had a president as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seem prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place. Read this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding. Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  NIGEL FARAGE: Among the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin.  This EU empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO. We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the president, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts.  Now, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine. Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin? Because if we do, we're certainly going about it the right way.  Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle too. In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side.  I suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us. Let us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not.  This article was adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the March 30, 2022 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight.

Bob Barnes, who has been cycling to all 50 state capitals in the span of a year, said he reached a "pivotal" place in his cross-country trip when he arrived in Florida.  While Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, New York, was only in Florida for a few days, his brief visit to the state marked the end of his second "switchback" of the United States and the beginning of his final leg of the journey.  But he still has plenty of land to cover.  "I want to show people that, no matter what, you can do anything you want."  Barnes arrived in the state of Florida on March 15. He visited Tallahassee, his 31st capital, and was on his way again by March 17.  He’s more than 60% done with his American adventure and shared with Fox News Digital his journey through the Sunshine State — noting that he's also shed some pounds along the way.  ‘Weather's turning, terrain is getting better'  Barnes said that after completing his second of three "switchbacks" across the U.S., he felt "great."  NEW YORK MAN BICYCLING TO ALL 50 STATES MEETS LONG-LOST HALF-SISTER IN LOUISIANA: ‘CAN’T MAKE THIS STUFF UP’  "I’m really happy," he said. "The weather’s turning. The terrain is getting better, but we’ve still got some mountains to go over."  "The other thing is, I’ve actually pedaled across the Northern United States before, so I should have a feel for it," Barnes added. "We’re going to be a little bit more south than we did before, but I can feel the end of the trip."  Completing his second switchback isn’t the only milestone for Barnes. He said he's also looking forward to reaching 10,000 miles on his trip — something he had "no idea" would fall so close to his arrival in Florida.  "Honestly, I feel a little sad, because the trip’s going to be over one day."  "Just like Mardi Gras, I couldn’t have planned that day any better," Barnes said. "Everything’s hit or miss, so I’m very surprised … It is a pivotal point in the trip."  "I can see the finish line in my head," he added.  Although he said it’s "exciting to reach these goals," he’s also going to miss the journey.  "Honestly, I feel a little sad, because the trip’s going to be over one day," Barnes said. "And I’m going to miss the trip."  MAN BIKING ACROSS US REVEALS FAVORITE STATE SO FAR  "I just love being out here," he added. "Every day is a new day. It’s incredible."  ‘We got along well’  During his visit to Florida, Barnes was able to meet up with "a friend of a friend of a friend," a man named Delbert who bought him dinner and let him stay in a house he owned that no one else was staying in at the time.  "He said I made a personal impact on him, more than I know."  "It just worked out," Barnes said. "He was a really nice guy and we got along well."  Delbert, a veteran, is also a cyclist and "a good dude," Barnes said.  "One thing that he told me that I really appreciated — he was like, ‘You don’t even know how much of an impact you have on some people,’" Barnes recalled. "He said I made a personal impact on him, more than I know."  NEW YORK MAN BICYCLING TO ALL 50 STATES REACHES OKLAHOMA, REALIZES, ‘I’M STARTING TO FEEL PROUD AGAIN’  Barnes told Fox News Digital that he feels "great" knowing that he’s inspiring people.  "I know I’ll look back and realize it more, but that’s the whole idea. I want to show people that, no matter what, you can do anything you want," Barnes said.  Barnes has also noticed a personal change. He said he’s lost 30 pounds since he started his journey in August 2021.  "All you have to do is pedal 8 hours a day, and you will lose weight," Barnes joked. "It’s pretty simple."  Barnes had told Fox News Digital earlier that throughout his journey, his diet mostly consisted of peanut butter sandwiches and fast food. He's also had some Facebook followers make him food and take him out to dinner along the way. He said he hasn't done anything specific to lose weight other than spend most of each day on his bicycle.  ‘Full of history’: The old Tallahassee capitol  Barnes’ goal is to visit each state capital and move on, so he didn’t explore much of Florida aside from parts of the Panhandle for a couple of days on his way to Tallahassee and back to Georgia.  In Tallahassee, Barnes favored the old capitol building over the new.  "It’s this big, huge, old museum, which is cool," Barnes said. "[It’s] just got a better feel to it and it’s got the [creaky] floors, and it’s just full of history."  "The new one’s all business," he added.  "I’m not going to push it and put myself in danger just to put a few more miles in."  As always, Barnes had his celebratory beer after reaching Tallahassee and soon went to meet Delbert for dinner.  FORMER UBER DRIVER BIKES TO ALL 50 STATE CAPITALS IN 1 YEAR  "I’m a little disappointed in myself because I got to the capitol and I had all these big expectations of exploring the colleges and things like that," Barnes said. "I didn’t do a thing. I was tired and just relaxed."  The areas of Florida that Barnes rode through were "warm for the most part," aside from a day of wet weather.  "Tuesday was unpleasant," he said, adding how the rest of the week improved. "It was just cold and rain … It was a soaker."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As far as the road conditions, Barnes didn’t have much trouble in "a very bicycle-friendly city."  "You can basically get around anywhere you want in Tallahassee on a bicycle," he added.  Looking back, looking forward  Barnes said he hopes to be in Juneau, Alaska, by the end of July, so he can complete the journey within one year. He began his mega-trip on August 1, 2021.  "I need to make up some miles and I think I can, but … I try to be realistic," he said. "I’m not going to push it and put myself in danger just to put a few more miles in."  "I didn't expect to be in three snowstorms. I didn't expect to be in the wind for [so] long."  Looking back, Barnes said he "didn’t realize" his second switchback, across the middle of the U.S., was going to be so tough.  "That was very challenging," he said. "I didn’t expect to be in three snowstorms. I didn’t expect to be in the wind for that long of a time. I didn’t expect hills."  "Looking forward to the third [leg of the trip], I have preconceived notions and I just hope those are the things that do happen," Barnes added.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  Barnes said he expects North Dakota and South Dakota to be flat — and also windy. He anticipates the Rocky Mountains won’t be "as hard to go over" as the middle of the country.  "And then the Midwest — I’ve actually pedaled through Columbus and Indianapolis and Michigan four years ago, so those are all things in my head that feel good," Barnes said.  Next stop: Peach State  Until then, Barnes was looking to his 10,000th mile and reaching his 32nd capital, Atlanta, Georgia.

Tuesday is National Vietnam War Veterans Day, a day when Americans thank and honor all those who served in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War.  The relatively new military holiday was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, five years after President Barack Obama proclaimed the holiday in 2012, according to White House press release archives.  In his proclamation, Obama explained why it is important to create and recognize National Vietnam War Veterans Day.  VIETNAM VETERAN RECOGNIZED FOR HIS SERVICE 50 YEARS LATER  He wrote that the Vietnam War is "a story of patriots who braved the line of fire, who cast themselves into harm's way to save a friend, who fought hour after hour, day after day to preserve the liberties we hold dear."  "Yet, in one of the war's most profound tragedies, many of these men and women came home to be shunned or neglected — to face treatment unbefitting their courage and a welcome unworthy of their example," the proclamation continued later.  "We must never let this happen again."  AMERICAN VETERANS, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TRAIN UKRAINIANS IN COMBAT CARE  The proclamation went on to explain that National Vietnam War Veterans Day is a way to "reaffirm one of our most fundamental obligations: to show all who have worn the uniform of the United States the respect and dignity they deserve, and to honor their sacrifice by serving them as well as they served us."  March 29 was chosen as the day to honor Vietnam War veterans because on March 29, 1973, the last of America’s troops left Vietnam and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam was disestablished, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.

The last American personnel were evacuated from Vietnam in April 1975, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.  During the Vietnam War, more than 58,000 Americans were killed and "many thousands more" were wounded, injured or determined missing, according to the Department of Defense.  VIETNAM VET WANTS OTHER TO KNOW: YOU ARE NOT ALONE  Today, National Vietnam War Veterans Day honors everyone who served on active duty in the U.S. military from Nov. 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, the Vietnam War Commemoration says on its website.

Conservative activist Scott Presler is traveling the nation to urge Americans who are sick of "failed Democrat policies" and rising gas prices to register to vote as Republicans while cleaning up the streets of trash-infested cities along the way.  "A major reason why I’m conservative and why this issue is so important to me is… our government is taking care of foreign nationals over the American people and my heart is with 50,000 homeless veterans. My heart is with 500,000 homeless Americans," Presler told Fox News Digital.  He began his journey in the summer of 2019 when then-President Trump famously criticized Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess" that "no human being" would choose to live in. The remarks hit home with Presler, the son of a retired Navy captain, who first decided to get involved with Republican activism when he became upset while watching Barack Obama get reelected in 2012.  MICHELE TAFOYA DISHES ON PIVOT FROM NFL SIDELINE TO POLITICS, ‘THE VIEW,’ AND WHAT SHE’S WILLING TO FIGHT FOR  "They inspired me to take action because everyone was tweeting, they were posting content about the trash in Baltimore, but nobody was doing anything and I thought to myself, ‘OK, if not me then who?’ So I tweeted out to my followers and said, ‘I’m going to Baltimore,’" Presler said. "The tweet went viral."  The Northern Virginia-based Presler was initially concerned that he committed to more than he could handle, but fellow conservatives quickly stepped up and offered to help. He didn’t know a thing about organizing a major cleanup effort, but figured it out along the way, ordering dumpsters, browsing Home Depot for inspiration and even renting a Porta Potty.  "Within six days we organized 200 volunteers, on a Monday, a workday, and we picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours on the most dangerous streets of America in West Baltimore," he said.  The 6-foot-5 inch Presler, known for his signature Fabio-like locks, then decided he could achieve similar success in other cities despite being a private citizen with limited resources who doesn’t have the backing of the government.  "We went to Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Dukane, Detroit, Houston, Kenosha, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Portland, Pittsburgh, Philly, and I was even protested for picking up trash in San Francisco, California," Presler said.  While it may seem like Presler is some sort of jet-setting mogul who travels around the nation, he actually relies on the kindness of like-minded people who care about America.  "The way that I’m able to do this, is if people want to donate, they may, but I have never once asked for donation. I’m very proud of that," he said. "People open their homes to me, like literally. I’m sleeping on couches, I’ve slept in RVs, I’ve slept in bunkbeds, I cuddle with people’s animals at their homes, and so it’s been the generosity of the American people opening their hearts and homes to me."  SPRING BREAKERS LET LOOSE AMID NATIONWIDE CRIME SPIKE, CURFEW ENACTED IN ONE POPULAR DESTINATION  Presler, who has nearly one million Twitter followers, didn’t even let coronavirus stop his mission, despite having to pause for a few months in 2020 when travel was difficult during the early months of the pandemic.  "My first cleanup after COVID was in Decatur, Georgia after the state of Georgia opened up and since then I have not stopped," Presler said.  While a global pandemic didn’t halt Presler’s mission, he feels "failed policies" from Democratic lawmakers made it much more difficult.  "I think, in the last two years we’ve seen crime, we’ve seen the homeless epidemic continue to rise, in part even under President Trump, but it was because of the regressive Democrat policies of ‘defund the police,’" he said. "What is the fruit of those failed policies? We’re seeing violent crime going up, we’re seeing homeless encampments popping up – Austin, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, New York City."  Presler said he’s encouraged by the way Americans have responded to the failed Democrat policies, including New York’s Nassau County where citizens on the outskirts of New York City are sick of the mess left by far-left leaders.  "They just voted red for the first time in decades," he said. "We’re seeing the people are responding to the waves of violent crime and homelessness, and they’re responding by voting conservatively," Presler said.  LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOMELESS COUNT TO BEGIN AFTER COVID-19 SHUTTERED LAST YEAR'S EVENT  When Fox News Digital asked the constantly optimistic Presler which areas of America are in the most distress, he quickly rephrased the question.  "The cities that, we’ll say, need the most love and attention, because I want to put a positive spin on it," Presler said before answering. "Definitely, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, but I will say, the cleanup that I think we had the most impact in doing was in Van Nuys, California."  Presler and his team of volunteers picked up a staggering 50 tons of trash from a homeless encampment in the suburb of Los Angeles.  "It was federal property leased to the state of California, and it had all of this trash, and it had homeless people living there," he said. "The federal government said, ‘We don’t have to clean this up because it’s leased to the state of California,’ the state of California said, ‘California said we don’t have to clean this up because this is federal property,’ so it took private citizens working with the homeless community who opened up the gate to us, who, by the way, donned hazmat suits in 90-plus degree weather to clean up the community."  BIDEN'S HOMELESSNESS CZAR WILL ONLY WORSEN NATION'S CRISIS  Presler thinks the government could clean up America and offer opportunities to improve the lives of the homeless community in one fell swoop if it truly cared.  "If we want to solve homelessness, and we also want to solve the problem of litter in our streets and cities, I love the idea of potentially hiring members of the homeless community… we can provide them with job experience, work experience and also help beautify our cities so that we’re killing two birds with one stone," he said. "If our government really wanted to show that it cares, it will put we the American people first and provide mental health care, providing housing, and providing job opportunities to the American people."  As the conservative activist travels the nation to clean up American cities, he also helps Americans register to vote. This month he traveled to Long Island, New York and set up at various gas stations getting customers who are peeved over bloated gas prices to register as Republicans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I’m very focused on the midterm elections, I’m dedicating this next year exclusively in order to take the House, take the Senate, win governorships and state legislatures across the country, but ultimately that means that we need to expand the electorate and register new voters," he said.  Presler has he’s already made significant impact in Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New York and plans to visit as many states as possible to register Americans to vote for Republican candidates.  "Ultimately, people aren’t responding well to President Joe Biden leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan, they’re not responding well to Joe Biden gifting the Taliban billions of dollars, they’re not responding well to inflation, and gas prices and war with Russia over Ukraine. They’re not responding well to the crisis at the border and the fentanyl epidemic and illegal immigration and MS-13 and sex trafficking," Presler said. "So they’re responding by registering to vote at their current address."

Between Ginger and Mary Ann, there was one star who received more fan mail on the set of "Gilligan's Island."  "That’s the easiest question," TV producer Lloyd J. Schwartz told Fox News Digital. "Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann, got five times the fan mail than everybody else.  "She was the only normal person in the show," the 75-year-old shared. "She was the one everyone identified with. All the other folks were extreme characters. But Mary Ann seemed like the girl next door. The girls loved her because she was like their best friend. And the guys loved her because she was cute and accessible to them. Ginger (Tina Louis) was a voluptuous movie star. She almost seemed untouchable to mere mortals. But Mary Ann was the cute one who you could easily be friends with."  Schwartz is the son of Sherwood Schwartz, who created both "Gilligan’s Island" and "The Brady Bunch." Sherwood Schwartz died in 2011 at age 94, but the late star’s classic TV shows have lived on with the younger Schwartz, as keeper of the flame. Most recently, the writer has kept busy working on his latest comedy, "Classic Couples Counseling," which opens at Hollywood’s Theatre West April 1.  ‘BRADY BUNCH’ PRODUCER LLOYD SCHWARTZ ADDRESSES BIGGEST RUMOR FROM BELOVED SITCOM: ‘SMOKE AND MIRRORS’  As Schwartz looked to the future of his comedy, he doesn’t think twice about reflecting on his days working alongside his late father.  "I was only on very briefly, and I was very young," he said. "But I grew up knowing the show had a special connection with people. My dad always said that a tropical island has been the center of many famous stories, including ‘Swiss Family Robinson.’  "And the story was special because it was about people from different walks of life learning together. They had to work together to succeed in life, and it was possible. Look at our lives today. People should learn to live together, so we could all succeed. And I think that’s the message my dad wanted to share."  Schwartz said he stayed in touch with Wells, the wholesome ‘60s star who captivated audiences across the country among a misfit band of shipwrecked castaways. The actress died in 2020 of causes related to the coronavirus at age 82.  "We did lots of things together," said Schwartz. "We did some plays together, and we talked quite a bit. She was a really dear person who embraced her character Mary Ann. She loved what Mary Ann represented and the influence it had on people. She loved how she made people feel years later. And she certainly continued to get fan mail. She adored her fans.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  "I remember we were doing an event somewhere and people couldn’t stop coming up just to say hi to her," Schwartz added. "As I stood next to her, I realized what her life must have been like. I remember one guy approached her and said, ‘If I had to pick between Ginger and Mary Ann, it would be you.’ She would always respond with a smile and say how nice that was. And then the next guy would come over and say the same thing. She probably spent her whole life with people coming up to her saying how much they adored her. And she was extremely gracious with every single person."  Besides TV, Wells’ other real-life roles included teacher, motivational speaker and conservationist. She also made her mark as an actress on stage.  "She was able to continue her acting in different ways," said Schwartz. "She did a lot of theater. But she was thrilled if you just knew her as Mary Ann. She knew how much that role meant to people."  Louise, 88, is the last surviving member of a cast that included Bob Denver as the title character, Alan Hale Jr. as the Skipper, Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer as wealthy passengers Thurston and Lovey Howell and Russell Johnson as the Professor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Wells, a native of Reno, Nevada, represented her state in the 1959 Miss America pageant and quickly pivoted to an acting career. Her early TV roles were on shows including "77 Sunset Strip," "Maverick" and "Bonanza."  Then came "Gilligan’s Island," a good-natured comedy that aired from 1964 until 1967. It became an unlikely but indelible part of popular culture. Wells’ innocent Mary Ann complemented Louise’s worldly Ginger, and both became innocuous ’60s TV versions of sex symbols.  Wells’ wardrobe included a gingham dress and shorts that modestly covered her belly button, with both costumes on display in Los Angeles at The Hollywood Museum.  TV movie spin-offs from the series followed, including 1978′s "Rescue from Gilligan’s Island," but Wells also moved on to other TV guest roles and films, including the 2002 vacuum cleaner salesman comedy "Super Sucker" with Jeff Daniels. She starred on stage in dozens of plays, including "Chapter Two" and "The Odd Couple."  HOLLYWOOD REACTS TO ‘GILLIGAN’S ISLAND’ STAR DAWN WELLS’ DEATH  In 2013, she was honored for her work with a Tennessee-based refuge, The Elephant Sanctuary.  To mark the 50th anniversary of "Gilligan’s Island," Wells wrote "A Guide To Life: What Would Mary Ann Do?" with observations about her character and the cultural changes that took place while she was stranded.  A few years ago, a friend launched a GoFundMe drive to help cover medical and other costs for Wells, although she protested she didn’t need the assistance. She did end up acknowledging her need and accepted more than $180,000 in donations.  "Wow! I am amazed at the kindness and affection I have received," Wells said in a social media post at the time. She said a "dear friend" undertook it after a frank conversation.  ‘GILLIGAN'S ISLAND’ STAR TINA LOUISE PAYS TRIBUTE TO DAWN WELLS  "Where did the time go? I don’t know how this happened," she said at the time. "I thought I was taking all the proper steps to ensure my golden years. Now, here I am, no family, no husband, no kids and no money.’"  Wells added in the post that she was grateful to her supportive fans and that her outlook remained positive.  Shortly before her death, Wells told Fox News Digital she had plenty of reasons to be thankful.  "At a time when it feels like everything is bad news, the good still outweighs the bad," the actress said in November 2020. "So even in tough times, we can and should be grateful for everything around us. I wake up, and I am grateful to have another day. I am grateful to feel a seasonal cool morning through my patio door. I am grateful for those who take the time to say ‘hi’ if to simply show that you matter."  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

New details have emerged surrounding the question of why Will Smith wasn’t removed from the 94th Academy Awards following his viral smacking of Chris Rock.  The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Wednesday said that Will Smith was asked to leave Sunday's Oscar ceremony after striking Rock but, they claim, he refused to do so.  "Jada, ‘GI Jane 2,’ I can’t wait to see it," Rock said on stage in front of the Oscars audience, including to an unhappy Pinkett Smith.  The actress has been publicly outspoken about how she deals with alopecia – an autoimmune condition that causes hair loss. Pinkett Smith said she shaved her head in order to own her diagnosis and mitigate its impact on her mentally. Pinkett’s daughter, Willow Smith has also buzzed her head in solidarity with her mother.  WILL SMITH'S OSCARS SLAP PROMPTS ACADEMY DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS, STAR REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO LEAVE CEREMONY  Smith then walked briskly to the Oscars stage and slapped Rock.  "Wow, Will Smith just smacked the s--t out of me," Rock said before entering into a verbal back-and-forth with the "Ali" actor.  HOWARD STERN, JUDD APATOW, OTHER COMEDIANS DEFEND CHRIS ROCK: 'HE HANDLED IT LIKE A PRO'  "Keep my wife's name out your f---ing mouth," Smith could be heard yelling following the physical altercation.  In fact, within the hour, as the "Made in America" performer took home the best actor award for his portrayal of Venus and Serena Williams’ father, Richard Williams in "King Richard," Smith was welcomed to the Oscars stage with a standing ovation from his Hollywood peers.  SMITH WAS CONSOLED BY A-LIST PEERS  Images captured that night after the physical encounter showed Smith being consoled by the likes of A-listers Bradley Cooper, Tyler Perry and Denzel Washington.  Meanwhile, on stage support came from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman as Smith walked up to accept his honor.  While delivering his acceptance speech, the actor pressed through tears that Washington told him, "At your highest moment, be careful — that’s when the devil comes for you."  Following his win, Smith was also seen at an Oscars after-party with his A list family, partying with his Oscar trophy and singing along to his own music.  NOT EVERYONE WAS OK WITH ACADEMY ALLOWING SMITH TO ACCEPT OSCAR  However, not everyone was OK with the fact that Smith was not only allowed to remain in the famed Dolby Theatre after the assault, but many notable celebrities expressed their distaste for the moment and disappointment at the Academy for letting the "Independence Day" star accept the award.  Howard Stern went on to defend Rock saying, "Poor Chris Rock is a comedian and just trying to get through the day to make the f---ing people laugh at that horrible ceremony."  CHRIS ROCK SPOTTED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NIGHT OF WILL SMITH'S OSCARS SLAP  Kathy Griffin and Joe Rogan both expressed concern over the precedent that Smith's actions set and what it means for comedy clubs in the future.  "It sets a terrible precedent in so many different ways," Rogan said during Tuesday's episode of his podcast. "It sets a terrible precedent for comedy clubs. Like, are people going to decide to go on stage and smack a comedian now?"  "Let me tell you something, it's a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a Comedian," Griffin wrote via Twitter. "Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters."  In the days after the smack, actor and comedian Jim Carrey also slammed Hollywood for rewarding Smith with a standing ovation mere moments after his onstage outburst.  "I was sickened. I was sickened by the standing ovation," the "Liar Liar" performer told Gayle King on "CBS Mornings."  THE ACADEMY ‘UNLIKELY’ TO ‘WEAPONIZE’ WILL SMITH SLAPPING CHRIS ROCK AND STRIP HIM OF OSCAR, EXPERT BELIEVES  "I felt like Hollywood is just spineless en masse, and it just – it really felt like, 'Oh, this is a really clear indication that we're not the cool club anymore,'" Carrey added.  King probed Carrey on Rock’s decision not to press charges against the "Ali" star for the literal slap in the face, and from Carrey’s point of view, Rock simply doesn’t "want the hassle" that comes with filing a police report along with the subsequent media barrage. But Carrey added that had he been in Rock’s position, an expensive lawsuit would have been swift.  "I'd have announced this morning that I was suing Will for $200 million because that video was going to be there forever," said Carrey. "It's going to be ubiquitous. You know, that insult is going to last a very long time. If you want to yell from the audience and disapprove or show a disapproval or say something on Twitter or whatever – you do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words."  Comedian Wanda Sykes – who was a co-host at Sunday's Oscars ceremony – also criticized the Academy for allowing Smith to accept his Oscar statue, calling the decision, "gross."  WILL SMITH’S ‘BAD BOYS’ DIRECTOR MICHAEL BAY, OTHER CELEBS REACT TO CHRIS ROCK OSCARS SLAP  "It was sickening. It was absolutely – I physically felt ill, and I'm still a little traumatized by it," Sykes added. "For them to let [Will Smith] stay in that room and enjoy the rest of the show and accept his award – I was like, ‘How gross is this? This is just the wrong message.'"  "You assault somebody, you get escorted out the building and that's it," she pressed. "But for them to let him continue I thought it was gross."  Sykes’ fellow co-host, Amy Schumer also lamented the intense moment on Wednesday after she took a few days to collect her thoughts on what went down.  "Still triggered and traumatized," Schumer wrote alongside a photo of herself. "I love my friend @chrisrock and believe he handled it like a pro. Stayed up there and gave an Oscar to his friend @questlove and the whole thing was so disturbing," she continued. "So much pain in @willsmith anyway I'm still in shock and stunned and sad."  ACADEMY CONDEMNS WILL SMITH'S ACTIONS, LAUNCHING FORMAL REVIEW OF CHRIS ROCK SLAP  "Im proud of myself and my cohosts. But yeah. Waiting for this sickening feeling to go away from what we all witnessed."  "The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night’s show," the statement from the Academy read. "We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law."  CHRIS ROCK ADDRESSES PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER FOR FIRST TIME  On Wednesday night in his first standup comedy show since the slap, Rock hit the stage to a thunderous three-minute standing ovation from a sold-out room of attendees.  "How was your weekend?" Rock asked the crowd at the Wilbur, a theater of 1,200 seats in South Boston during his "Chris Rock Ego Death World Tour 2022" outing.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I had a whole list of jokes before this week happened," the funnyman quipped of the retrospective moment before admitting he was "still kind of processing what happened" that infamous night.  The board of governors met on Wednesday to discuss possible disciplinary action against Smith.  Fox News’ Lauryn Overhultz, Sarah Rumpf, Melissa Roberto and Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.

The House overwhelmingly passed the Securing a Strong Retirement Act on Tuesday with a bipartisan vote of 414-5. The legislation now heads to the Senate.  WHERE ARE SURGING CONSUMER PRICES HITTING AMERICANS THE HARDEST?  "Oftentimes in this chamber, you will hear the phrase ‘transformative,’" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., said on Tuesday as the bill neared passage. "Sometimes it’s hyperbolic but on this occasion, this is transformative legislation."  Although the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee unanimously passed the bill nearly one year ago, it has since languished as lawmakers debated a different retirement proposal that Democrats hoped to include in the now-defunct Build Back Better plan.  The legislation, which builds on a landmark 2019 retirement bill, aims to further expand Americans' ability to save for retirement and increase their ability to do so.  It includes a number of retirement reforms, including expanding auto-enrollment for saving plans, providing assistance to individuals with student loan debt, assisting businesses in providing more retirement savings options and raising the age for required minimum distributions to tax deferred retirement accounts like 401(k)s.  INFLATION TOPS AMERICANS' BIGGEST ECONOMIC CONCERNS, GALLUP SURVEY SHOWS  One provision in the second Secure Act would require employers to automatically enroll eligible workers in 401(k) plans starting at 3% of their salary. That would gradually increase until the worker is contributing 10% of gross pay. Employees would have the option to opt out or select a different contribution amount, while businesses with fewer than 10 employees or that are less than three years old would be exempt from the law.  The bill would also increase how much individuals can contribute to their savings accounts as they get closer to retiring: For instance, individuals age 62, 63 and 64 could make catch-up contributions of $10,000, rather than the current $6,500.  Another key measure included in the bill would increase the starting age for required minimum distributions – the amount that a retirement plan account owner must withdraw annually beginning when they reach 72 – to 73 in 2022, 74 in 2029 and 75 by 2032.  Student loan borrowers would also benefit from the legislation, which would allow employers to contribute to workers' retirement accounts when those employees make student loan payments. For instance, if you put $100 toward your student loan debt, your company could "match" that and donate $100 to your 401(k).  One other notable change the legislation would make is providing an option for employer matching contributions to be made into a Roth IRA, rather than a 401(k).  It's unclear how the Senate plans to handle the second Secure Act, as some senators are working on their own retirement legislation.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  During a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on retirement savings Tuesday morning, panel chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., said she is working with ranking member Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., to assemble and move a retirement package "later this spring," according to Roll Call.  "I hope our discussion today will inform and improve these efforts and our Democratic and Republican colleagues will continue to bring forward ideas over the next few weeks so we can build a good bipartisan package that helps workers, retirees and families," Murray said in opening remarks.

Mickey Rourke didn’t flinch when he was offered the chance to appear in a faith-based film.  The veteran actor and former boxer is featured in "Man of God," which centers on St. Nektarios of Aegina, a Greek Orthodox saint known as a priest of the common people during the 19th century. Despite being exiled from Egypt, he cared for the poor, taught peasant girls to read and write, as well as established a convent on a barren island that still stands as a beacon to pilgrims, Variety reported.  The film, directed and written by Yelena Popovic, stars Aris Servetalis as Nektarios. Rourke portrays a paralyzed man.  The star, who was previously nominated for an Academy Award in 2009 for "The Wrestler," told Fox News Digital that his connection to Catholicism compelled him to take on the role.  MICKEY ROURKE SAYS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IS A 'NIGHTMARE KIND OF SCENARIO,’ PRAISES KLITSCHKOS FOR FIGHTING  "You know, they’re making all these Marvel movies that just make me sick to my stomach," the 69-year-old explained. "It’s nice to find a filmmaker who wants to take on a chance and make a movie like this one. There’s no guarantee that you’re going to have an audience. But I think with everything going on in the world, people are going to be curious about what this story is about. And it has a lot of integrity."  Rourke said reconnecting with his faith hits close to home.  "My life would’ve taken a different path if my grandmother wasn’t so religious," he reflected. "A lot of brutal s—t happened early on in my life. And when that happens, you live with shame. You either live in that shame and be a broken man or you get hard. I was very comfortable on the streets growing up. But there is a God. My priest told me, ‘God hears everything you say. He just doesn’t give it to you when you want it. You’ve got to keep persevering and keep communicating with him. You’ve got to talk to God before the house burns down.’"  Rourke recalled how prayer played a significant role in his life. He was 18 when he said his younger brother Joey was diagnosed with cancer at 17.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  "I was told he had six months to live," Rourke recalled. "My grandmother told me about a particular saint, St. Jude. I still pray to him to this day. And my brother made it. … If Joey would’ve died at 17, when I was 18, there’s no way I wouldn’t been in the acting business."  Joey Rourke passed away in 2004 at age 50. The elder sibling admitted that for two years, he couldn’t pray. He eventually found solace in Rev. Peter Colapietro at Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in New York City.  "I would talk to him on weekends," said Rourke. "And I would tell him, ‘I’m not gonna pray anymore.’ One day, he looked at me and said, ‘Mickey, nobody gets a pass. Everyone’s gonna lose a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, an aunt, and an uncle. I know how you feel deep down inside.’ I felt understood. But it took me two years before I was able to pray again."  "Father Pete saved me," Rourke continued. "He saved me from doing some really bad s---t. Something really bad happened to the person I was with, who was raped and beaten up really badly. I had very dark plans for the people that did it. But it was his guidance that prevented me from doing something really terrible. Because if someone beats up your wife, you’re not going to just give him a punch. It was no accident that I met Father Pete. … He would tell me, ‘Mickey, God will take care of those people worse than what you plan on doing.’"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Rourke said therapy also helped him cope.  "That’s the thing about getting too hard," he said. "I pretty much messed up my career in Hollywood. I would tell people I’m a man first and then I’m an actor. I went to war with everybody in the movie business. And there’s a saying in boxing, you get up when you can. And that’s what I did. I got great advice from Richard Harris years ago. He told me, ‘You can’t beat them all. There’s too many of them.’ I really wish I would’ve listened to Richard and handled things more diplomatically. But that was never my way."  Rourke admitted that at one point, he was blacklisted in Hollywood for being too difficult to work with. However, he remarked that the new generation of filmmakers aren’t afraid to go toe to toe with him on set when it comes to making a movie.  "The young guys are cool," he said. "They don’t care about what they hear. They judge me by my acting ability, not my old reputation. So it’s been sort of a resurrection of being able to work with younger directors. I have a love/hate relationship with acting. I enjoy what I’m doing at the moment because I can give everything that I’m taught. I have my confidence. I went through the s—t that I went through, so I’m able to use it in my performances. I could be standing across from any f---ing actor. And I know that motherf----r has not seen, done or been through what I’ve been through."  ‘DUCK DYNASTY’ STAR PHIL ROBERTSON WEIGHS IN ON CANCEL CULTURE, REFLECTS ON PAST A&E SUSPENSION: ‘NO REGRETS’  Colapietro passed away in 2018 at age 69. Rourke said the lessons he learned from the beloved priest have stayed with him over the years.  "You’ve gotta be tough," he said. "I gotta be tougher than the rest. I just don’t have to handle it the way I used to. … After being blacklisted for 13 to 15 years, I learned to accept the fact that there are some things that they just don’t teach you in acting school. There isn’t a class about networking or understanding that there’s a lot of politics in the studio and it’s a business. I want to do films that speak to me."  "I don’t want to make movies where it’s just one guy and a machine gun killing 200 other people just because it sells," he shared. "That’s for somebody else. It’s not for me. But one thing I’ve learned is that everything’s in God’s hands."  "Man of God" hits select theaters on Monday, March 28.

A restaurant in France has reportedly received threats over its signature dish, poutine, because some people have been incorrectly associating the dish with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  La Maison de la Poutine, which has locations in Paris and Toulouse, posted a statement on social media last week saying that it has received "calls of insults and even threats" over its name, according to a translation of the French statement.  Though the name may sound similar to the Russian president, poutine has no actual connection Putin. Poutine, which originated in Canada, is made of French fries, cheese curds and gravy.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  In its statement, La Maison de la Poutine clarified that it "is not linked to the Russian regime and its leader."  "Our dish was born in Quebec in the 1950s," the restaurant said. "And the stories to tell its origin are numerous. But one thing is certain: the poutine was created by passionate cooks who wanted to bring joy and comfort to their customers."  CANADIAN DINER REMOVES POUTINE FROM NAME BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE PUTIN  La Maison de la Poutine went on to say that it offers "its most sincere support to the Ukrainian people who fight courageously for their freedom, against the tyrannical Russian regime."  HOW AMERICAN CITIES ARE HELPING THEIR UKRAINIAN SISTER CITIES  This isn’t the first time someone has made the connection that poutine sounds like Putin.  Fox News Digial previously reported that a diner in Drummondville, Quebec, Le Roy Jucep, decided to take the word "poutine" out of its trademark to show solidarity with Ukraine after Russia invaded the country – and to make people smile.  Le Roy Jucep, which claims to have invented poutine, posted its decision to remove the word "poutine" from its name, though the dish is still available on its menu.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The business's Facebook page still lists it as the inventor of "poutine," although the name has been changed to say "The Inventor of Fries, Cheese and Gravy."  Though Le Roy Jucep reportedly received some hateful replies and phone calls for the change, it also got plenty of love.  In a post on Facebook, the restaurant wrote: "Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that's already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts."

After the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Oksana Kononets and her mother were determined to arrive in America for a special cause.    Earlier this month, the 29-year-old appeared in an annual fashion show hosted by Runway of Dreams, a nonprofit that supports adaptive clothing for people with disabilities. The model was left paralyzed at age 19 after she injured her spine caused by a fall from the fifth floor. She has used a wheelchair since 2012.    Kononets told Fox News Digital she was due to fly to Los Angeles on Feb. 26 for the show. But two days prior, on Feb. 24, Russia launched a full-scale attack on her home country.    "I remember how Kyiv was bombed," she said. "I remember everything. Mama took our luggage and we headed to the train station. We didn’t know which direction to go. We just found a free space on the train and started to move. It was a huge crowd. But we needed to leave."  FORMER MISS UKRAINE VERONIKA DIDUSENKO RECALLS HER ESCAPE WITH SON AMID RUSSIAN INVASION: 'I HAD TO SURVIVE'  Kononets and her mother embarked on a five-day journey from Ukraine’s capital. During the trip, she and many others spent 11 hours on a train to Poland for safety.    "It was very hard to bring my wheelchair to the train," she said. "One part broke. We tried to do everything we could to fix it. We also didn’t know where to stay. Should we stay in Ukraine? In Warsaw? Or somewhere else in Europe? I was scared and very tired. We needed to be safe."    "I remember during my journey so many of us trying to leave, wondering where can we stay," she shared. "There were grandmothers, 90-year-olds, with their pets. They didn’t want to leave their loved ones behind."    After Kononets and her mother arrived in Poland, they traveled to the Netherlands. From there, they secured a flight to the U.S. with the help of a friend. And on March 5, the pair landed safely in Los Angeles.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  "Throughout our journey, all we could think about was Ukraine and what was happening to my country, my people," she said. "My friends stayed to serve and protect Ukraine and help as volunteers. I think of them constantly. While yes, Los Angeles surrounds me with beautiful nature, kind people and peace, I still think of my home. And I hear of friends who are killed. It’s too hard."    Just days after landing in America, Kononets appeared on the runway. She said her goal was to raise awareness of people with disabilities who want to pursue careers in fashion. She also wanted to represent her pride for Ukraine.    "Before my accident, I worked as a makeup artist," she explained. "After the trauma, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t be without work. But when I saw a girl in a wheelchair with the same disability who was a model, I found purpose. If she could do it, why can’t I? For two years, I worried I couldn’t do anything. That I was useless. But that image helped me recover. And since 2015, I worked as a model. It has been a dream to be on a runway even before the war."    "When the war happened, I wanted to show, more than ever, that Ukrainian women are strong and have big dreams," she continued. "I came to not only represent me but to represent what we’re capable of. I found strength in myself, and I felt support from my friends and family in this long, hard journey. But I know today that I have the power to fulfill my dream. I’m proud to be Ukrainian. It’s a huge honor. And I want to represent that."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Kononets said she’s grateful for being in America. But her family remains on her mind constantly. Her father, sister and grandmother, who is 83, are still in Ukraine. The patriarch lost work after his business was bombed.    "The most important thing is that we’re alive," she said. "We are thinking of our future. I’m thinking maybe here, I can try to find work in fashion as a model. That way, I can support my family. I would also like to volunteer and give back. Anything to help my family and those leaving Ukraine."    "Right now there is a shortage of medicine in Ukraine," she said. "This is a problem for people who have asthma and [other ailments]. We need more support in the medical field. It’s very hard. Just two days ago, my father stood in the queue to buy bread. He stood for two and a half hours. The other day he couldn’t move his foot. But today, I spoke with him, and he’s doing OK. But you wonder, when will this end?"    Kononets also commended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s efforts during the devastating conflict.  KATHERYN WINNICK SAYS ZELENSKYY IS 'PERFECT EXAMPLE' OF 'UKRAINIAN STRONG': 'A TRUE LEADER'  "He has done good work as a president," she said. "I also think it would be good if people can come to the USA. Europe right now, it’s very full. So many people escaped Ukraine and moved to other cities. Now more than ever, we need to support each other in the world."    Kononets said she and her mother are taking it a day at a time as they stay closely connected with their family in Ukraine. She is hopeful to find work in the fashion industry that will allow her to continue raising awareness on those with disabilities, which will also help support her loved ones back home.    She remains hopeful that her country will persevere, noting that her people are "strong."    "Never give up," said Kononets. "You have to believe in yourself, no matter what. You can become stronger after something terrible happens to you. Dreams can come true."  UKRAINIAN POP STAR DETAILS ESCAPE FROM WAR TO US TO USE HER VOICE: 'THE WAR MUST BE STOPPED'  Russian President Vladimir Putin has labeled the attack on Ukraine a "special military mission." The invasion has sparked worldwide condemnation. Hundreds have already been reported either dead or wounded, including children. Millions have fled or attempted to escape the country.

Bella means beautiful, but Bella Hadid didn’t think she was when she was a teenager.  Supermodel Bella Hadid is finally coming clean about having plastic surgery, but she is speaking out on her regret of having it done when she was 14, according to a Vogue report last week .  "I was the uglier sister. I was the brunette. I wasn’t as cool as [my sister] Gigi, not as outgoing," the twenty-five-year-old said.  "That’s really what people said about me. And unfortunately when you get told things so many times, you do just believe it."  Hadid, who was born at Georgetown Hospital in Washington, D.C., but grew up in California, regrets having the cosmetic procedure done on her nose when she was so young, admitting, "I think I would have grown into it."  Approximately 229,000 cosmetic surgeries were performed on teenagers between the ages of 13 to 19 in 2017, with teenagers accounting for approximately four percent of all cosmetic procedures, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons .  BELLA HADID SPORTS ‘PALESTINE’ JEWELRY WHILE OUT ON THE TOWN WITH FRIENDS  But the plastic surgery experts caution that rhinoplasty, otherwise known as a "nose job," is not recommended until the growth of the nose is completed, which is typically around ages 15 to 16 in females and ages 16 to 18 in males, although in certain situations, such as a child with cleft lip, the procedure may be performed earlier.  "Some teens are more psychologically mature than others, but it's important to note that their brain development is not at a point where they can really think through long term implications and they aren't able to fully appreciate what the consequences might be," said Dr. Diana Zuckerman president of the National Center for Health Research.  Recent research by Drs. Rod J. Rohrich and Min-Jeong Cho, board certified plastic surgeons, found few guidelines that ensure teen plastic surgeries are performed appropriately .  "While a rhinoplasty or ear surgery can be performed safely by a board-certified surgeon and are, in many cases, appropriate for an adolescent, other cosmetic procedures such as breast augmentation, liposuction or injectables are typically not recommended for minors for several reasons, including lack of research," said Dr. Rohrich .  He is also concerned of the surge in young people asking for injectables to achieve augmented cheeks and lips despite the lack of evidence they are safe for adolescents.  "Girls nowadays live in a culture with so much pressure to change their appearances, whether it's putting on makeup or something more extreme like cosmetic surgery," said Leora Tanenbaum, feminist author of "I Am Not a Slut."  "But rather than judging or shaming individuals [like Hadid], we need to think more collectively about the pressures young women face to look a certain way."  Cosmetic procedures improve confidence by providing more of a psychological boost in teenagers rather than the actual physical changes, especially those who are bullied or have poor self-esteem, according to Dr. Steven Pearlman, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon.  HOW TO BUILD A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE IN YOUR CHILD  Even though it’s legal for plastic surgeons to perform procedures on anyone less than 18 with parental or guardian consent, Pearlman notes it’s important that teenagers have the emotional maturity to appreciate the risks of having procedures, such as infection, bleeding and scarring for a rhinoplasty, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  Given teenagers bodies are still developing, other experts blame the "surveillance culture" where the outsiders constantly critique the physical appearance of women, where those who appear different from the societal standard are pressured to change -- especially those of color who don’t meet the mold of the "Eurocentric feminine ideal," according to USA Today.  "It speaks to the fact that women exist in this impossible space where we have to be real but not too real. We have to enhance our appearance but if we enhance it 'too much,' then we're not authentic," said Tanenbaum.  Zuckerman argues in an ideal world surgeons would use more discretion to delay certain surgeries in teens, while parents would work with their children to delay decisions of cosmetic procedures " … until a teenager is of age, like at least 18."  "I wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors," Hadid said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  She told Vogue: "So now everything that I do in my personal life is literally to make sure that my mental state stays above water. Fashion can make you or break you. And if it makes you, you have to make a conscious effort every day for it not to break you."

Ukrainians are showing their support for their country.  Over the past few weeks, tattoo artists in the country have seen a rise in requests for patriotic symbols or phrases from tattoo customers.  This is just one of several ways that business owners in the country are helping to keep morale high during this difficult period.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The Ukrainian flag has become one of the most popular requests at a tattoo shop in Lyiv, the Associated Press reports. Customers are also requesting other patriotic images, such as military vehicles or coats of arms.  One of the shop's artists, Natalia Tanchynets, spoke with the news outlet and explained that 70% of the proceeds from these tattoos will go to the Ukrainian army.  The shop also sports anti-war imagery, such as a stop sign with the word "war" written on it.  An 18-year-old woman recently got a tattoo of the Ukrainian coat of arms with a military aircraft at the shop. She spoke with the AP, explaining her reasons for getting the tattoo.

On Tuesday, U.S. regulators moved to approve a second COVID-19 vaccine booster for adults aged 50 years and older.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first made the announcement, authorizing an extra dose of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for emergency use in that age group and for certain younger people with severely weakened immune systems.  Later that same day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the extra shot as an option, stopping short of urging that those eligible rush out and get it right away.  BIDEN TO RECEIVE SECOND COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT ON CAMERA  "Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster 4 months after their prior dose to increase their protection further. This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19 as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. "CDC, in collaboration with FDA and our public health partners, will continue to evaluate the need for additional booster doses for all Americans."  FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said there's evidence that vaccine protection can wane over time, particularly in higher-risk groups, and that another booster will help increase protection for higher-risk individuals.  According to CDC data, 97.4 million Americans have received a booster dose of a coronavirus vaccine and 217.5 million have been fully vaccinated.  The Biden administration has urged people to be "up to date" with their vaccines – especially amid the winter's surge of the omicron variant – and two shots and a booster still offer strong protection against severe illness and death.  With cases markedly lower since January, state and local leaders have moved to reverse or ease pandemic restrictions, hoping to return to "normal."  The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center recorded 23,643 new cases and 961 new deaths in the past day – even with vaccinations reported at the lowest levels since 2020.  NAVY BARRED FROM ACTING AGAINST RELIGIOUS VACCINE REFUSERS  However, with the spread of the even more transmissible BA.2 omicron sub-variant and White House reporting a lack of funding for fourth vaccine shots, the future of the pandemic in the U.S. remains uncertain.  Scientists have predicted that new variants would spread, though experts have questioned the need for additional boosters.  Dr. Anthony Fauci told the BBC last weekend that Americans should be prepared for new COVID-19 restrictions, cautioning that health officials are witnessing similar conditions in the U.S. as those in Europe.  He had previously said this month that he does not expect another surge.  In addition, two vaccine doses were nearly 80% effective against needing a ventilator or death during the omicron surge. The CDC recently said a booster pushed that protection to 94%.  Vaccine effectiveness was lowest in immune-compromised people.  While the FDA cited Israel data for its action, it is not yet clear how long any extra benefit from another booster would last, with Marks saying higher-risk Americans may need another dose in the fall if the vaccine is tailored to current viral threats.

On April 6, an FDA panel will hold a meeting to discuss vaccines in America.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Click here for live updates.  SPRINGDALE, Ark. – The National Weather Service said an early morning thunderstorm spawned a tornado in Northwest Arkansas on Wednesday.  Shortly after 4 a.m. Central, a tornado touched down in the southern and the eastern portions of Springdale, causing significant damage. Initially the NWS estimated the damage to be consistent with an EF-2 tornado but confirmed Wednesday evening it was an EF-3.  Storm chaser Brian Emfinger of Live Storms Media said damage appears to have begun in the vicinity of the Northwest Arkansas Mall and continued northeast causing occasional significant damage to homes and businesses. One business was destroyed with parts of it flung onto a road 100 feet away. A cell tower was also taken down. Trees could be seen down in every direction.  Springdale Police Department Lt. Jeff Taylor said at least seven people have been injured, including two people with critical injuries. Peak winds hit 145 mph and the twister traveled for over five miles.  One of those injured was Javy Ortiz' uncle, who was inside a home damaged by the tornado.  "(My family) woke up to the storm, the whole place was moving," Ortiz told FOX Weather. "They looked out the window and my brother said he could see the tornado coming down. They took off running for the living room and that's when the trees crashed down."  While most of his family escaped, his uncle was pinned by a large tree.  "My neighbors helped get him out and rush him to the hospital," Ortiz said. His uncle suffered serious injuries including a collapsed lung and an injured chin. They were still anxiously awaiting an update on his condition.  Springdale is located about 10 miles north of Fayetteville.  "Our first responders have completed door-to-door searches," said Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse. "And we believe everyone has been accounted for. Many residents have been displaced from their homes and numerous businesses have reported significant damages. I have officially declared an emergency, which should trigger declarations at the county and state level."  A command center has been established at the Springdale Parks and Recreation Center.  Springdale elementary school destroyed in storm  The George Elementary School in Springdale, was damaged by the tornado. The school district said the gymnasium was destroyed and the kitchen and cafeteria were severely damaged.  The school district is closed Wednesday as maintenance staff assesses the damage in all buildings throughout the area.  "Thank you to the Springdale Police Department, the City of Springdale and the first responders who worked so quickly to serve our families," the district said in a Facebook post. "The outpouring of love and support from our community is what makes Springdale great."  Arkansas residents survey damage  Residents surveyed damage and debris after the tornado-warned storms swept through Johnson, a community south of Springdale.  FOX Weather Watcher Ashley McCutcheon posted video to Twitter showing the aftermath from her neighborhood. The NWS had warned of locally damaging wind gusts early Wednesday affecting eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas.  Fayettleville resident Kaylie Crane said she got up and drove to see the damage in the southeast portion of Springdale.  "So many roads were blocked off … so scary and heartbreaking. Hoping everyone is okay," she posted on Facebook.  More debris was seen scatted around Springdale in video taken by Anel Mata on Twitter. She said they were planning to drive their friend to work "just to find out they’re definitely not working today."  NOAA's Storm Prediction Center has issued a Tornado Watch valid until 1 p.m. Central time for parts of Arkansas, northern Louisiana, southern Missouri, far southeastern Oklahoma, and northeastern and extreme East Texas. This watch area includes Little Rock in Arkansas, Shreveport in Louisiana and Longview in Texas.

Don’t believe the propaganda. They are lying to you here” is seen as a hero to those who oppose Putin’s war. Her actions also put a spotlight on the Kremlin controls the information their country’s media is allowed to report  As free media organizations across the globe continue to report on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-controlled media has obscured the truth and reality of the war for many of its citizens.  Earlier this week, former Russian news anchor Anna Kultin joined host Jessica Rosenthal to discuss her experience working at a Russian state-controlled TV network, how the misinformation blurs the truth for Russian citizens, and how the Kremlin is portraying the invasion of Ukraine.  Kultin also discussed how Russians fear their government and how the people should not be blamed for the actions of their leaders.  Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire conversations with former Russian news anchor Anna Kultin and learn more about how Putin weaponized state media and how propaganda is being used in this current war.

However, there are signs diplomacy could still work. Fox News Senior Field Producer Yonat Friling joins the Rundown to discuss how Russian conflict with the U.S. may be less severe than many Americans fear. Friling also breaks down what’s happening in other parts of the globe, from the attempted ballistic missile attack in Abu Dhabi and more signs that the threat of ISIS is still very real.

Hurd feels we got the resolve of the Russians wrong and the levels the Ukrainians would go to defend their country. Hurd points to how the Ukrainians defended their country once before in 2014 when the Russians first went into Ukraine. When the Russians tried to go into Kyiv, Hurd points to how the Ukrainians pushed the Russians back when they had even less equipment and were less organized than they are now in their fight against Russia. Hurd believes we need to do everything we can to help Ukraine while they have momentum on their side. Hurd also wants the Biden Administration to do more to build a bigger posse of allies to deal with Russia and continuing Chinese aggression. Hurd is concerned many countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa are not participating in sanctions against Russia. Hurd wants America to work more at getting the rest of our hemisphere together in this fight against Russia.  Hurd also addressed the border crisis and the Biden administration ending Title 42. Hurd says we must stop treating everybody like an asylum seeker. Hurd believes he can make an argument you don’t need Title 42 in order to deport more people because you can’t come here illegally. Hurd went on to say, when you treat everybody as if they’re an asylum seeker, you impact the people that are truly asylum seekers. Another area that Hurd wants us to do more about is dismantling human smuggling networks. Hurd asks why are we not using the entire resources of the U.S. Intelligence Committee community to dismantle some of these operations? Hurd says we know the license plates of the busses and cell phones of those moving people across the border.  Click here to order “American Reboot: An Idealist’s Guide to Getting Big Things Done”

Cornyn says if the reports are true, it is shameful the Biden Administration is putting pressure on Zelenskyy to cut a deal with Putin. Cornyn went on to say, if there is a deal cut, allowing Putin to maintain his position in Eastern Ukraine with Crimea and the land that he has captured so far, this is going to happen again. When asked about the mindset of Putin, Cornyn responded that Putin is not crazy, but he does have fantasies on restoring the Russian Empire. Cornyn says that is the ideology driving Putin and if we think he is going to quit we are fooling ourselves.

Governor DeSantis on why he thinks reopening schools after covid has been the most consequential decision he has made as governor so far saying,  “I think ultimately it will be. Because when I did this was like June of 2020, and the data was very clear……. So we were able to really stand for the people who didn’t have much of a voice. And I think we — I mean, there’s a lot of decisions we’ve been vindicated on but that one I was opposed — this teacher’s union sued me, we beat them. All the Democrats were opposed, the media was opposed. No one will admit that they opposed me, to this day they will all act like they supported having the schools opened. So that tells you when you’re right.”  Governor DeSantis blasted California Governor Gavin Newsom saying,  “Well, first I would say how many people are moving from his state, fleeing to come to mine for freedom versus vice-versa? And I guarantee you we win in the net — in-migration people are leaving California in numbers we’ve never seen because of his failed policies.”  Governor DeSantis criticized President Biden’s gaffe-prone speeches saying,  “Well look, I mean, I think if you look at what we’ve done to fight back against Brandon so far, you know, we succeed. I mean the contrast between a daughtering (ph) quasi senile president who has to have his press team clean up his remarks after every time he opens his mouth versus somebody like me who’s out there — I’m very direct, I say what I mean, I mean what I say, I lead and I get things done. You know, they understand that people view Florida as really being the leader of our country in many respects, we’re really leading the free world in many — I mean, I have people from Canada that will come here that will write in to me, Australia, Europe — and they say, we look to Florida as the new citadel of freedom. They’re not looking to Joe Biden for that because they know that he’s just not capable of producing the type of leadership that they do.”  FULL Transcipt Below:  GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: We are here at the Governor’s Mansion in Tallahassee, Florida. I am delighted to welcome to the show Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican here in The Sunshine State. And some big breaking news today, your administration is suing the Biden administration over these continued mask rules, on airplanes for example. Talk about the thought process behind this and Florida’s standing in this lawsuit.  GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Sure. Well, first, welcome to the Governor’s Mansion, good to —  BENSON: Thank you.  DESANTIS: — have you here. So you know, this is a matter of principle. They extended it into April for no good reason. You have Fauci out there saying restrictions could be reimposed. And so, some people say, well, he may just let it go out in April. But I think they could definitely bring it back. So the issue is, is this an overstep of government authority or not? And so our attorney general’s done a great job, you know, she filed the lawsuit today. And so, we’re standing behind that. I’m surprised that courts upheld — haven’t struck it down by now. But clearly, at this point, I don’t even think it has a rational basis given where we are as a society. So I think we’ve been leading on pushing back against Biden’s overreach on all fronts — you know, not just this, the vax mandates, the border, all those things. And I think that’s what people want to see. Because I think Biden is really out of control, he’s clearly not in command of the White House. And he’s expanding government in ways that I think will be dangerous.  BENSON: So you won the Governor’s Mansion in 2018, it was a blue wave year. You squeaked through at 0.4 percent, that victory margin. And at the time, registered Democrats in this state outnumbered Republicans by hundreds of thousands.  DESANTIS: Almost 300,000.  BENSON: That has changed dramatically, and there was news today on that front. This is like a sea change, one might call it, in Florida. Tell us about this.  DESANTIS: Sure. So we were down almost 300,000 in 2018 when I got elected. Today we can announce that Florida Republicans now outnumber Democrats by over 100,000 registrants. So you’re looking at close to a 400,000-registration swing. And the thing is, is I thought we could catch them by my election at the end of this year, in November. We caught them in November of 2021. And so then I’m like, man, maybe we’ll be 50,000 to 100,000 up by the election. We’re already at 100,000. So that this pace, we could be 200,000 to 250,000 registrants ahead. And I think here’s why it matters for elections in Florida, mid-term elections for sure but even presidential. Registered Republicans turn out at higher rates than registered Democrats. And then a Republican like me, I’m going to get a higher percentage of registered Republicans than the Democrat will get of registered Democrats. You know we still have legacy Democrats who are — who are pretty conservative. And so, functionally it used to be Democrats outnumbered us, we had a turnout advantage, and then you’d kind of fight in the middle. That was why Florida was really a swing state. Well, now, we have a — we’re building a big registration advantage and the turnout advantage. And then I think this —  BENSON: You’re leading among independents as well.  DESANTIS: Exactly, this is going to be a red year. So I think, obviously, I will — I think I’ll win independents big because of the job I did as (ph) governor. But I think all Republicans are going to win independents because I think they’re rebelling against Brandon. And I think that they’re going to want to basically show their frustration and vote for Republicans.  BENSON: What counts as a blowout in this state? Six points?  DESANTIS: Oh, who knows, I mean — you know, look, I think it’s — Florida’s a tough state. It’s always a tough state to kind of get your — because there’s many moving parts. And we’ve always been a transient state. But I think now, being able to capture such a rapid change — and it is an ideological migration that is skewing very heavily to Republicans. Like, we don’t really know. So we don’t really know what the electorates going to look like. I — my guess would be whatever, kind of, the public polling is going into the election, you can add a couple points to the Republicans’ total, mine and I think other Republicans. Because I think it’s going to be hard for them to capture what all these new registrants mean in terms of the turnout and all of the things that go into modeling an electorate.  BENSON: Because sometimes you hear Republicans and conservatives worried about people leaving Illinois, and California, New York and New Jersey, moving to other places and then voting the same way. And turning places like Arizona purple, Colorado blue. Sounds like the opposite effect is happening here. This is getting redder in Florida.  DESANTIS: I think so, and I think part of it is we’ve always had lower taxes. So we’ve always had migration from that. The Northeasterners would come, you know, a lot of Democrats, a lot of Republicans. The Midwesterners are generally pretty conservative. But then with COVID, you had people that were fleeing COVID lockdowns. They had had enough on that. And then you had the Floyd riots and the defund the police. And a lot of families were like, look, I need to live in a state that’s a law-and-order state. So the number of people I run into from, like, Washington state or Minnesota who say one of the breaking points for them was the fact that crime was going through the roof. And here I am, I was like one of the only governors backing law enforcement, even in the summer of 2020. So I think there’s a number of factors. And then, quite frankly, the media has helped us with this because the corporate press will always try to paint Florida as, like, the worst place ever. The only people that works with are the — are the leftists who actually believe the corporate narratives. Nobody else in America believes it anymore, especially conservatives. So a conservative in Wisconsin is going to say, oh, well, hell, CNN’s attacking the governor of Florida. He must be doing a good job. And then, they are more interested in visiting and ultimately moving here.  BENSON: It’s like in-kind contributions —  DESANTIS: It’s absolutely —  BENSON: — from the mainstream media every day with you. Now you mentioned Fauci a few minutes ago. And one of the mottos or catchphrases that you have here that conservatives like, “Don’t Fauci My Florida.” A lot of those same Conservatives think please do Florida my America. Is this state — is your leadership in this state a model, do you think, for other Republicans around the country at the state level and maybe nationally?  DESANTIS: Well, I certainly think we’ve been willing to lead with purpose and conviction without worrying about whether it was safe to lead or not. Like, I have not conducted a single poll since I’ve been governor. I just do what I think is right —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: Focus groups?  DESANTIS: Never, not once. Now, I’m going to have to start polling the horse race when I get into the election but —  BENSON: But like, on governing decisions you’re not polling? You’ve not —  DESANTIS: I have not. I have not done a single poll.  BENSON: So how do you make these decisions then?  DESANTIS: I make them based off the facts, the data and my convictions. And my view is like, you know, if I polled you and like 10 of your friends on an issue, that’s a static analysis. That doesn’t tell me that if I set a vision, and I execute the vision then where will you guys come out. So I can move people —  BENSON: Like you moving —  DESANTIS: I’m moving people. I’m showing them that this is how a state should be governed. So I think what we’ve been willing to do is, you know, we do not let corporate media trim our sails. We’re willing to stand up against woke corporations, which, quite frankly, a lot of Republicans have been more corporate Republicans that defer to some of these corporations. Look, I want a limited government. I want a free enterprise economy. But when these big corporations are using their economic power to try and impose leftist ideologies, like in my state, we fight back on that. And then I think we’ve been strong at fighting back against Biden. So I think there’s a lot of those things. It’s also interesting, you know, we just had a cabinet meeting today. So we had a report about Florida’s finances. You know, we have — we have $18 billion in debt. We’ve reduced the debt by probably 20 percent, 25 percent since I’ve been governor. So out of $110 billion, $105 billion budget annually, our debt is only $18 billion. You contrast that with the federal government, you know, Biden just put out a $5.8 trillion budget, but there’s $30 trillion —  BENSON: Right.  DESANTIS: — in debt. And so I think we’ve shown we have the lowest per capita tax burden in the country, we have no state income tax, but we meet all the needs. I just did a big increase of pay for teachers, the biggest in Florida history. We gave $1,000 bonuses to all cops and firefighters for the second year in a row. We’re doing a lot for our water resources to help our fisherman, our boaters, and our everglades. So we’re meeting the challenges that we have because we’re really creating a virtuous cycle. Good economic conditions attract more people. We expand the economic base whereas these blue states I think they create a vicious cycle. They tax and regulate so they repel people to leave their state. The base shrinks so they got to do it again to try to square the circle. And you just can’t have it. So states like Illinois, New York they are in a — in a tailspin and they’re not probably going to be willing to change their policies. But they would have to change the policies.  BENSON: Also had their schools closed for more than a year in those places. You made a decision last school year to bring the schools back open. Was that the most consequential decision you’ve made as governor so far?  DESANTIS: I think ultimately it will be. Because when I did this was like June of 2020, and the data was very clear, just to be honest. I mean, it wasn’t a difficult decision in terms of —  BENSON: Actual science?  DESANTIS: — yes, if you looked at the science, if you looked at places in Europe that had had schools open. If you looked at the fact that kids were at such low risk of COVID and really weren’t prime drivers of transmission. There was no basis to say kids should not be in school. So substantively if you followed the data that’s where you would have come out. However, politically and with the media, I mean, they thought this was the worst thing ever. A lot of parents were scared because CNN is telling them, you know, Little Johnny may end up dying of COVID if he goes to first grade. So we had a plan, we executed it. I got a diverse state, I’ve got a lot of Liberal school districts, I mean, most of them are conservative but I got some — we go tall the school districts on board, we structured it in a way that incentivized them to have five days a week. We gave parents the right initially to say, look, if you’re more comfortable with remote you can do it but that’s the parent’s choice. The school can’t lock the kid out. And so, having the kids in, letting them play sports, letting them do activities, letting them do all that. Had we not done that, the problems that would have developed I think would have been problems that we would have — it’d be seen by now. But they are problems that if you and I talked five years from now we would be seeing those problems. So we were able to really stand for the people who didn’t have much of a voice. And I think we — I mean, there’s a lot of decisions we’ve been vindicated on but that one I was opposed — this teacher’s union sued me, we beat them. All the Democrats were opposed, the media was opposed. No one will admit that they opposed me, to this day they will all act like they supported having the schools opened. So that tells you when you’re right.  BENSON: One of your critics is a fellow governor. I saw a recent interview with Gavin Newsome out in California, and he went out of his way in an interview to come after you. He said that you’re a performance artist. He said, “I do not look for inspiration to that particular governor, not on the pandemic, not on other policy including the absurdity that was his woke initiative and the laughability (ph) around stopping something that doesn’t exist, critical race theory.” That’s his quote. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he’s attacking you. What’s your response to that from Newsome?  DESANTIS: Well, first I would say how many people are moving from his state, fleeing to come to mine for freedom versus vice-versa? And I guarantee you we win in the net — in migration people are leaving California in numbers we’ve never seen because of his failed policies. And here’s what I’d say about the pandemic. If you look at the COVID mortality, people point out California has less per capita mortality than Florida, which is true — they’re also the second youngest state. So if you adjust by age, we’re one of the oldest states, we’ve very similar. However, this is where I think his leadership has been terrible. If you look at excess mortality, California’s had a higher percentage of excess mortality since COVID started than Florida — so that includes COVID, but it’s not limited. So what does —  BENSON: Those are lockdown deaths?  DESANTIS: Those are lockdown deaths, absolutely. Those are deaths that his policies have caused, driving people to despair, drug addiction, lack of opportunities. And so there’s — people vote with their feet. You know, you hear a lot of people like him. How many other governors have said the same thing he does, then they end up down in Palm Beach or Miami the first chance they get? You know, you have these —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: The DGA, the Democratic Governors’ Association had their event here.  DESANTIS: So what I like to say is people posture politically, and they do these talking points, but how they actually act really tells the story. And when people vote with their feet, yes there’s a lot of Californians who like what we’re doing who are coming, but even the ones that posture against Florida typically find their way here. And so, I think that the proof’s in the pudding when it comes to that.  BENSON: The slings and arrows from Democratic politicians, from the national media, from the White House. I mean, you have been called out from the podium by the president himself. My conclusion is they see you as a threat to their power. Are they right to see you as a threat nationally?  DESANTIS: Well look, I mean, I think if you look at what we’ve done to fight back against Brandon so far, you know, we succeed. I mean the contrast between a daughtering (ph) quasi senile president who has to have his press team clean up his remarks after every time he opens his mouth versus somebody like me who’s out there — I’m very direct, I say what I mean, I mean what I say, I lead and I get things done.You know, they understand that people view Florida as really being the leader of our country in many respects, we’re really leading the free world in many — I mean, I have people from Canada that will come here that will write in to me, Australia, Europe — and they say, we look to Florida as the new citadel of freedom. They’re not looking to Joe Biden for that because they know that he’s just not capable of producing the type of leadership that they do. But I absolutely think from the time COVID hit, I think the media wanted — they wanted to use it to defeat Trump in 2020. But they’ve tried to use it against me in any way they can. And then now that we’re on to other issues, they’re always trying to find a way to attack me and attack Florida. And I do think it’s because I’m able to expose them, I’m able to show people that the emperor has no clothes and they’re not used to that. I mean, they’re used to Republicans that will rollover for the left, and I just don’t do that, I stand by ground.  BENSON: And we will pick up on that exact theme when we come back. My exclusive one-on-one discussion with Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, at the Governor’s Mansion continues after this break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  From Tallahassee, Florida it’s The Guy Benson Show. We now continue with my conversation with Governor Ron DeSantis. So let’s talk about something that you did yesterday in the state. You signed into law this Parental Rights in Education Bill, it was hugely controversial in the media, it got a lot of national attention. I have had so many people bombarding me about this because I’m gay, I’m conservative, and I’m not subtle about the fact that overall I support what you’ve been doing down here in Florida. So of course, we’re going to talk about this. Just so you know where I’m coming from, the audience knows already — I’ve written about it, I’ve talked about it. I actually read the bill, a novel concept, seven pages, pretty easy. I think that the moniker don’t say gay is a misnomer. It is biased and lazy for the media to adopt it. It’s an activist slogan that does not reflect what’s actually in the law, number one. Number two, that K-3 provision that you talk about all the time, I think it’s unobjectionable, I think it’s commonsense and the polls are bearing that out — people, parents, Americans, Floridians support it. I do as well. I have two concerns about the law and I’m just curious to get your responses to them. Number one, when you get through the K-3 verbiage, literally in that same sentence it also bars classroom instruction on these types of issues sexual identity, gender identity that are “not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate at other grade levels.” That language strikes me as vague and subjective. Who gets to decide what is age appropriate later on? Like, in your mind, when would it become appropriate? Middle school, high school —  DESANTIS: So it’ll be a combination between the state board of education and the local school boards. And I think that you may see some parts of the state come to little bit different conclusions depending on the years on some of that stuff. But look, at the end of the day, I think the reason this became an issue — because when this first became an issue, you know, I wasn’t even aware of some of the stuff that’s going on. But with this transgender and the gender identity there isn’t an effort to try to tell people, well you know, you may not really be a boy, you may be a girl. And I think that’s totally inappropriate in the school system. You know, we need to focus on the normal things. And so I think that’s really the genesis of this. We had a lady yesterday who talked about her experience. Now, her daughter was a little older, daughter was in middle school here in Leon County. And she was in school, and the school administrators took it upon themselves to “transition her,” to a boy. They even gave her a boy’s name, they never got the parents’ consent and they never got the parents’ permission. So the curriculum issue, I think, is something that is important. You don’t want — I showed the thing of the genderbread man they created where they’re trying to say oh not really a boy, not really a girl. But the —  BENSON: And that’s clearly designed for younger kids —  DESANTIS: Very younger kids. But I think — the issue that I think is, what role does the parent have? I mean, if a school is doing something as drastic as trying to change somebody’s view of their own gender, does the parent not have a right to know that that’s going on in school? And —  BENSON: Right. I mean, it’s a fair question, and it’s a fair point. We’re up on a break, but that exchange wasn’t over. We’ll play the rest of it on the other side of this break, plus much more to get to and we will do so next with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on The Guy Benson Show.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  It is the happy hour on The Guy Benson Show, coming to you from Tallahassee, Florida where earlier today I spoke with Governor Ron DeSantis at length in his office. When we left off, he and I were chatting about the controversial Parental Rights in Education Bill that he signed into law just yesterday. Our back and forth was substantive, it was respectful, and it wasn’t done. Here’s the rest of it before we move on to a variety of additional topics as well. Listen. The second concern that I had about it is, because I read these paragraphs in the law several times trying to make heads or tails of it. I talked to a couple lawyers conservative and liberal, and they said depending — and this could maybe be decided by lawsuits. But depending on how you read and apply some of this stuff, could it be interpreted as a requirement for schools, let’s say a high school student is struggling with coming out, and he decides to confide in a trusted teacher — a trusted counselor let’s say. Say hey, I’m struggling, I’m not sure what to make of this. I don’t want to tell my parents yet. Would the school then have to disclose that confidential conversation to a family? Is that a legitimate concern under this law? Because having gone through the process myself, it’s hard, right. And having those discussions in confidence with someone that you can trust without it necessarily being required to go somewhere is vital for young LGBT people. And my concern is if they feel like this law would require — Florida would require schools to, based on the mental wellbeing or the emotional wellbeing, which is how it’s written in the law — it’s kind of vague. If they’re going to be required to tell families, those conversations might get bottled up, they may not happen, and that could be harmful. I’m just curious your perspective on that.  DESANTIS: Right. So for one, the — before you get to that point, classroom instruction, sometimes people say like, can you even say something in class? That’s not what it is. It’s what’s the curriculum on that part?  BENSON: Instruction —  DESANTIS: Yeah, yeah. Second part of that is, it needs to be some type of service that’s provided in terms of a medical service. And so, when you’re dealing with things — like in California, you know, they had a girl who the school was administering hormones to — and she was depressed, and they should have treated the depression. They were trying to give her hormones. So she ended up committing suicide, the wife — or the mother is now suing. So I think it’s, if they’re doing something that is — just like if you took your kid to a doctor, you know —  BENSON: So it’s treatment, not a conversation.  DESANTIS: Right, exactly.  BENSON: OK —  (CROSSTALK)  DESANTIS: I think there needs to be some service that’s rendered in terms of a medical service, that way —  BENSON: That’s a very important distinction —  DESANTIS: — where a parent would have clearly the right to be informed and to object. And just think about it, I mean, before all this — like, people have conversations all the time. I mean, that’s never really been the issue that’s triggered this. I think the issue that’s triggered this is you have kids that are going in and they’re now being changed in terms of their gender identity. They’re being told — and it’s odd because —  BENSON: So, just to clarify, if a high school student came to his teacher that he really trusts, had him for several years said, hey, I’m having this issue. I might be gay, I’m not really sure. It is not your position that under this law that conversation would need to be —  DESANTIS: Not unless they’re getting a medical service.  BENSON: OK. Now, you mentioned world corporations (ph) a short while back. Let’s talk about Disney because that’s a huge employer in this state. People associate Disney with Florida for all the obvious reasons. I think I made my pilgrimage in fifth grade down to Orlando. I saw the statement that they put out yesterday, ripping the bill, ripping you indirectly for signing into law saying that they’re going to be fighting to take it off the books moving forward. Did you have conversations with the higher ups at Disney about this on the substance, and did they communicate to you whether they, let’s say, oppose that K-3 component? Because this is a company that caters to overwhelmingly parents and young children, are they against the K-3 things that the majority of the American people support?  DESANTIS: So here is I think why this statement was totally outrageous. I mean for two reasons. One they said it should have never been passed in the first place. I talked to our Speaker of the House after that statement came out; he said they never contacted him while they were working — while it was moving through the House of Representatives in Florida. They didn’t say anything about it. I mean they could have called them and said that they had problems with it. They didn’t do it. And so to say it should have never been law in the first place they were not even engaged at those critical processes. And so they’re responding to I would say left-wing activists and their rather than the actual substance of it. Secondly, for them to say that they’re going to work to repeal substantive rights of parents because it’s one thing if you’re taking a political position about, you know, don’t say gay. You know, you can’t say the word — and we know that’s not in the bill. But they would —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: Not even close.  DESANTIS: — they would — they would be targeting provisions that provide parents substantive protections. And so I think they overstepped their bounds with that statement. They do not run this state. I’m not going to let our state be hijacked by a bunch of California corporate executives. And the fact of the matter is I think they think that they want ever they want in Florida they get. That may have been true in the past, that is not true now. And we’re going to govern this state based on the best interest of the people of Florida not what any corporation but particularly that corporation is demanding.  BENSON Got to ask you this, too You must be probably prodded and prompted everyday by someone asking about your ambitions beyond 2022. And I know that the goal of you and your campaign right now is to win a big reelection in Florida. You seem to be on-track to do that. I’m not going to ask you — look if you want to announce you’re running for President, by all means do it right here, right now. I’m not going to ask you that question directly. I’m going to ask you this instead. When you hear that buzz directly or indirectly, how does that play into your thinking? Do you just kind of put it in box and set it aside until next year or something? Is it something that, you know, sometimes you daydream about? What’s your thought process? Because no one ever asked me to run for President so I don’t know how I would think about it. But if people were asking me all the time, I don’t know how I would manage that internally. I’m just curious how you do?  DESANTIS: Well I mean a couple of things. One is, you know, people have this merchandise with like ’24, it’s not my merchandise. So just so you know, that’s totally organic.  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: You’re making it, OK.  DESANTIS: They’re doing it. People will come up to me with this on and they will talk about 2024. The number one response I have to them in Florida is you know I’m running in 2022, right. And honestly some of them don’t. And so we’re going to make sure we educate everyone, you know, that we’ve got a really important election, you know, in 2022. But here’s the thing, I’ve never been to Iowa in my life. I have never been to New Hampshire. I think I may have been there in my 20’s. I’m just doing my job and so I’m not doing anything differently than I would do whether people were buzzing about me or not. I’m trying to do the best I can for the people I represent. I’m fulfilling my campaign promises and I’m willing to make tough decisions and lead. And so that has caused people to recognize me and view me as a leader. But it’s not because I’m out there parading around or doing anything of that. So I appreciate when people look — I mean I’ll get — I get letters into my office every day from people around the country, you know, just saying, you know, we wish the country could be more like Florida. We’ve love to be able, you know, to see you run sometime. But at the same time, you know, I’ve got a wife that’s, you know, successfully battling breast cancer. I’ve got a 5-year-old, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old and I got the best state in the country right now to do. So I have my hands full. So I spend really zero time thinking about it except when people come up to me. And they’re all very well intentioned. I mean they all really, you know, mean well. But at the end of the day, you know, it’s really neither here nor there for me.  BENSON: Last political question before a quick lightning round on non-political stuff. You have a constituent in Florida — he lives, I believe, in Palm Beach. People have heard of him, he was the President for a while there, for four years. He’s been hinting very heavily that he wants to run again. If he were to run again, should he be a heavy frontrunner for the Republicans by virtue of his previous position or should it be a wide-open field?  DESANTIS: Well look I saw some news that he made a hole-in-one the other day at his course.  BENSON: Yes.  DESANTIS: So I just want to congratulate him. You know, I’ve been able to play —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: He was very excited about it.  DESANTIS: — I’ve been able to play golf with him over the years and, you know, he’s got a very good game and he’s a good player. And so, you know, who knows. I mean, you know, we’ll see kind of how all the — how all the dust settles on this. What I tell people, you know, with me in Florida is, you know, I plan on being the nominee, our filing hasn’t happened yet, and I think I’ve earned it. But you know what, I mean if someone wants to run against me they can. I mean I have to earn it every step of the way. I’ve got to earn —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: In the primary here?  DESANTIS: I’ve got to earn and then I’ve got to earn the general election. That’s just the reality. Although the Republican Party of Florida did officially endorse me. I don’t know what that mean but I think someone could still run. But hopefully they won’t run. So — but —  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: It sounds like one step at a time is the answer here.  DESANTIS: Yes, I think so.  BENSON: All right rapid-fire stuff. A lot of Floridians in a certain of your state were probably pretty thrilled and shocked when Tom Brady unannounced, right? He’s like never mind I’m coming back. You a Brady guy? You excited to have him back with the Bucs?  DESANTIS: 100 percent. So I grew up in that area, and I was a fan when they had the orange uniforms and when they used to have losing records year after year. You know, when Tony Dungy came on, he built a championship team. John Gruden took them over the hump and they won the Super Bowl. But it’s been rough sledding throughout last decade until Tom came. And that was a huge thing. And I think — I think, you know, he won the Super Bowl the first year, which was incredible. And if you look back at last year, I think he viewed it as probably his last year. But think about it, had they beat the Rams they would have probably beat the 49ers and the Bengals, I really believe that. I think they would have won back-to-back. And they were banged up and, you know, he had one of the best years not only of his career but of really any quarterback.  (CROSSTALK)  BENSON: And he’s performing.  DESANTIS: I mean it was — it was unbelievable. And so I think it was kind of the natural end of the career but then I think he started thinking, you know, we should have won the Super Bowl. We can do it if we get healthy, we add some stuff. So I was thrilled when it happened. I was sad when they lost. I was sad when he retired. But, you know, he’s the best football player of all-time. And he’s the best — probably the best team sport player of all-time. I never thought I would see someone better than Michael Jordan but if you think about it with what Brady’s been able to do by winning all those Super Bowls and to perform that way at that age and football is tough. I mean like this is a tough sport. He’s really head and shoulders above everybody.  BENSON: People often see you as kind of this political gladiator. You’re out there doing stuff, you’re out there taking like 60 minutes at the cleaners and, you know, every day it’s sort of relentless. What do you do to unwind that people might not know about?  DESANTIS: Chase my kids around. So I’ve got a five-year old daughter, a four-year old son and a two-year old daughter. My two oldest they love sports. My son loves golf and baseball. They love to swim. And so if I’m home on the weekend I’m not really resting, I’m not really getting any rest but it’s like we’re doing things and it’s probably been — you can look at your life before you were a parent and after a parent. There’s a clear divide. And so, you know, we’re very fortunate. We’re the youngest family that’s been in this Governor’s mansion since the 1800s. And I’m sorry, I think I’m still the youngest Governor in the country right now. But we haven’t had young kids like this — to have a big young family here. So it’s interesting. People see me out there doing this and then if they were only here seeing me like chase them around there and doing all this stuff. But that’s what we do.  BENSON: (Inaudible) baseball gear out front that I saw (inaudible).  (CROSSTALK)  DESANTIS: That’s right, oh, yes, no we set them right up in front of the Governor’s mansion. They’ll hit off the tee and then we’ll pick up the balls and then we’ll do that. And so it’s a lot of fun.  BENSON: You can pick one or both of these questions. What is the best book you read in the lat year? And what is a guilty pleasure TV show that you like to binge?  DESANTIS: You know, it’s interesting I mean I started watching “Yellowstone” over the — over the Christmas holiday and I think — and I think it’s a good show. Part of it, I mean Montana is beautiful. I’m just thinking like my wife’s watching that, she’s like oh, man, we need to go to Montana. So that’s fun for that. But, you know, the — what I try to do in terms of reading books is, you know, I try to just go back and read some of the things that are — that are really epic in history. I mean I know there’s new books that come out and I bet Mollie Hemingway did a good job on the election and there’s some other good ones I’ve read. But, you know, you can pick up something like “The Art of War”, you can read that in one sitting. I mean it’s a pretty small thing. You know, you can read some of these things that have really (inaudible). And there’s a lot of wisdom in there. And so I go back, and I will do that. And, you know, I read — I’ll read some “Federalist” essays. I’ll do things like that because I think it gets your mind going in a very sharp way. And so —  BENSON: You really are constitutionalist nerd, aren’t you? You’re like I just want to kick back and read the “Federalist Papers”.  DESANTIS: Well it’s timely and I think if you look at how they dealt with some of these issues you find out human nature has not changed. OK, these are perennial issues about self-government, about liberty and as we see these different storms in our time, the underlying principles that they articulated are just as applicable today as they were then. Yes, the window dressing looks a little bit different because society’s changed. But those insights are very strong.  BENSON: Last certainly not least, you mentioned her earlier, the First Lady. A scare with breast cancer, some really exciting news in the last few weeks. How is she — how has this been for your family?  DESANTIS: So she’s officially cancer-free. Now she’s still got to go through some of the radiation and stuff but that’s much easier than the chemotherapy was. And so she’s doing really well, she’s responding really well and — but what I think it just shows for all the women out there, you know, when this — when you get that diagnosis it’s very, very scary because, you know, your life, you know theoretically is hanging in the balance. But I could tell that you will — you have a great chance to beat this. Hang in there, fight the fight. They do great things nowadays in terms of the medical. And I think she’s an example of that. That you can get through this. And so I’m really proud of how she’s handled it. It is not easy dealing with at any time. But to have three little kids and then be in the public eye like she is, you know, it really was a — it really was a difficult time. But she’s handled it well and she will be back full strength very, very soon. So stay tuned.  BENSON: Governor, thanks for inviting me into your state and into your home. This was really cool. Looking forward to chatting again. Really appreciate it.  DESANTIS: All right, thanks so much.  BENSON: Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida on “The Guy Benson Show”.

And from Biden’s budget, it’s clear that the radical Left has totally forsaken American values. They’ve turned their backs on what’s important to Americans. They’ve turned their backs on American energy independence and American energy dominance. For years, our ability to produce safe, dependable and affordable energy has been a critical component in Pennsylvania, where I represent. And that’s helped to build the American energy dominance, which is so important. Realize that we have the capabilities to supply all of America, build the right pipelines and we can do that. And we have the ability to support our friends and allies in Europe to be able to export liquid natural gas that would sever their dependence on Putin and Russia for energy. Biden has failed to support our baseload power producers like coal, like natural gas, like oil like Marcellus Shale, and this is really escalating the inflation that all of the American families are seeing right now.”  Rep. Joyce also points out the consequences of the Biden administration not paying enough attention to the crisis at the U.S. Southern border. Listen to the podcast to hear what else he had to say!

Judge Jackson was questioned by lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. A few Democrats such as New Jersey Senator Cory Booker have claimed Republicans treated her unfairly. According to Shannon, these hearings were much tamer than the ones held for Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation in September of 2018.  “It was the very definition of a circus, and there were members on both sides of the aisle that I interviewed and talked with that week who could not get to and from their offices. They had police escorting them everywhere because it was wall to wall people chasing you onto your elevator, trying to keep you from getting to the floor to vote. That was just a different level, but I would say much of that was because of the public. But, we remember the Spartacus moment with Senator Cory Booker really trying to make a name for himself. Dick Durbin, who is the Democrat who chairs this committee, he gave an interview a few weeks ago before the thing, and he said, ‘Listen, I’ve got to remember I’ve got to wrangle these people’, because they have several people on this committee who have presidential ambitions. So even he knows that part of this is going to be a circus. So she got pressed pretty hard, I would say, by a couple of Senators who would not let it go. They wanted to demand answers from her. But I don’t think you could compare it to Kavanaugh, much more so because of the public element to that.”  Shannon also comments on President Biden seemingly calling for a regime change in Russia, and then walking back his comment.
