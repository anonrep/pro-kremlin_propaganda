REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Feb 20 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, three people familiar with the matter said.  The measures, which would only be implemented if Russia invades Ukraine, aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the "correspondent" banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and U.S. banks that enable international payments.  While U.S. authorities have said banking restrictions would be part of a package of possible sanctions, the administration's plan to cut correspondent banking ties - which underpin global money flows - has not previously been reported.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The United States will also wield its most powerful sanctioning tool against certain Russian individuals and companies by placing them on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively kicking them out of the U.S. banking system, banning their trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets, the same sources said.  The White House and Treasury Department declined to comment.  The sources said the package could change up to the last minute and it was unclear who the targets would be. However, they believe top Russian financial institutions including VTB Bank (VTBR.MM), Sberbank (SBER.MM), VEB, and Gazprombank are possible targets.  Experts consulted by Reuters said that while the correspondent banking tool lacks the punch of an SDN designation, which freezes a bank's assets, they could still deal a meaningful blow to the target banks by making it difficult to transact in U.S. dollars, the global reserve currency.  Much of global trade is transacted in dollars.  It is unclear whether Russian banks would be added to the SDN list, but both types of sanctions could hit Russia hard.  "Since a significant number of global trade transactions are in U.S. dollars this is a sanction with bite, but without the more complicated and deadly sanction of being placed on the SDN list and having all assets in the U.S. or in the hands of U.S. persons frozen," said Washington lawyer Kay Georgi, who specializes in international trade.  Sources noted that the administration could exempt certain transactions from the restrictions if deemed necessary.  'UPFRONT COSTS'  The Biden administration has been threatening tough banking sanctions against Russia for weeks in a bid to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Moscow has amassed upwards of 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, but Putin has denied plans to launch an attack.  Peter Harrell, who sits on the National Security Council, said last month that "heavy hitting financial sanctions" were part of a strategy to hurt Russia's economy but spare its citizens.  "The goal of the financial sanctions is really to have short term upfront costs on Russia, to trigger capital flight, to trigger inflation, to make the Russian central bank provide bailouts to its banks," he said in a speech late last month.  The tough warnings have put some U.S. financial firms on edge. Members of the financial services and payment industries have been in touch in recent days with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions, sources said.  Tensions grew over the weekend as Russia extended military drills in Belarus, heightening fears among Western powers of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Biden and Putin on Sunday agreed in principle to a summit, France said, offering hope conflict could be avoided. read more  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United States and Britain would cut off Russian companies' access to U.S. dollars and British pounds if the Kremlin orders an invasion.  The Biden administration has been similarly aggressive in its rhetoric. In a briefing on Friday, Deputy National Security advisor Daleep Singh told reporters that the cost to Russia of an invasion would be "immense, both to its economy and its strategic position in the world."

Western countries fear a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine in recent weeks is a prelude to an invasion, which Moscow denies. The United States and European allies have said any attack would trigger "massive" sanctions against Moscow. read more  "We expect decisions," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after arriving in Brussels to address a regularly scheduled meeting of EU foreign ministers.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "There are plenty of decisions the European Union can make now to send clear messages to Russia that its escalation will not be tolerated and Ukraine will not be left on its own."  "We believe that there are good and legitimate reasons to impose at least some of the sanctions now to demonstrate that the European Union is not only talking the talk about sanctions, but is also walking the walk."  But the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, as well as some of the assembled foreign ministers, made clear the bloc did not plan to impose sanctions yet. Borrell said he would convene an extraordinary EU meeting to agree sanctions "when the moment comes".  TALKS 'BADLY NEEDED'  For now, the EU supports the latest attempts to arrange further talks, Borrell said, after France said U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed in principle to a summit over Ukraine.  1/4 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock speaks to the media before a meeting with European Union Foreign Ministers in Brussels, Belgium February 21, 2022.

"I think the way to prevent war is to talk and to find compromise and ways forward that can prevent invasion in the first place, which should be our priority now," he said.  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock accused Russia of playing an "irresponsible" game with the civilian population of eastern Ukraine and urged it to return to the negotiating table.  Sporadic shelling across the line dividing Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the east has intensified since Thursday, with Western countries saying they fear Moscow is trying to create a pretext to invade. read more  "I urgently call on the Russian government, on the Russian president: Don't play with human lives," Baerbock told reporters after arriving at the meeting in Brussels.  "What we have seen over the last 72 hours in terms of attacks, violent disputes is really concerning," she said. "The responsibility lies with the Russian government which is why I call urgently on the Russian government: Come back to the negotiating table. It is in your hands."  The Kremlin confirmed on Monday that Putin and Biden could set up a call or meeting any time but said there were no concrete plans yet for a summit.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was on hand for the snowflake-themed ceremony at the Bird's Nest stadium, where International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach described the Beijing Games as "truly exceptional" before declaring them closed.  The Beijing Games, contained inside a "closed loop", were the second Olympics in six months to be deprived by COVID-19 of much of its festivity.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  They were also stalked by politics, with several countries staging a diplomatic boycott over China's human rights record, and the spectre of invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with President Vladimir Putin attending the opening ceremony in a show of solidarity against the West with Xi.  Still, China was spared any embarrassing protests by competitors over its treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority or anything else, and the thousands of foreign journalists on hand were stuck inside the closed-loop, unable to report more widely.  Sunday night's ceremony was capped by a 90-second fireworks display that spelled out "one world, one family," followed by a rendition of "Auld Lang Syne".  During the ceremony, Bach praised Beijing's organisers and made a call for unity as well as universal access to COVID-19 vaccines.  "You embraced each other, even if your countries are divided by conflict," he said. "The unifying power of the Olympic Games is stronger than the forces that want to divide us: you give peace a chance."  SNOWFLAKES AND LANTERNS  Bach was seated next to Xi during the opening ceremony, with space between them.  On one side of the stadium, which was roughly half full, red Chinese lanterns projected a glow as Olympic athletes entered en masse to "Ode to Joy", dancing and taking selfies.  The Chinese team drew cheers that grew louder when San Francisco-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu, who won two golds and a silver for China, was shown on-screen.  Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, joined in the applause, and Xi was later shown looking through binoculars at the spectacle of athletes walking across the illuminated LED-screen floor of the vast stadium.  1/9 2022 Beijing Olympics - Closing Ceremony - National Stadium, Beijing, China - February 20, 2022.

GOLD MEDALS, COVID TESTS  Beijing's tightly sealed bubble prevented the spread of the novel coronavirus at the Olympics or into the community, vindicating a zero-COVID policy that has isolated China inside what are nearly closed borders that shows no sign of easing.  However, many athletes had their Olympic dreams dashed by positive tests that prevented them from competing.  Dozens saw their preparations disrupted by enforced isolation, leading team officials and athletes to demand improved conditions including better food, internet, training equipment and more space. read more  On the snow, the 18-year-old Gu delivered on the hype generated by her dozens of endorsement deals making her the youthful face of the Games even as her success raised questions about nationality and privilege. read more  Gu's performance is a boon for the development of snow sports in China. Xi hopes that hosting the Games will get 300 million people involved in winter sports.  China's nine gold medals exceeded expectations, putting it in third place, while winter sports powerhouse Norway, with a population of just 5.5 million, won a record 16.  DOPING SCANDAL  While Xi delivered a spectacle for a Chinese public that was unable to attend - tickets were not sold and many connected with the Olympics through the unexpected mania for panda mascot Bing Dwen Dwen - millions of Americans tuned out, with TV viewership reported to be far lower than during the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.  The biggest legacy of the Beijing Olympics will be the controversy surrounding Valieva, who stumbled under pressure in her final skate, and the outrage directed towards Russian sports officials and the country's history of doping, which meant its athletes could not compete under Russia's flag.  Valieva failed a doping test at her national championships in December but the result was only revealed on Feb. 8, a day after she helped the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) win the team event.  She was nonetheless allowed to participate in the singles but finished fourth, her error-strewn performance prompting a harsh reaction from her coach Eteri Tutberidze that the IOC's Bach later said he found "chilling". read more  The saga, which dominated the Games, reopened debate over the suitability of the Olympic environment for minors and prompted the world's top anti-doping authority to investigate Valieva's entourage.

FED TIGHTENING  Also troubling markets has been the prospect of an aggressive tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve as inflation runs rampant. The Fed's favoured measure of core inflation is due out later this week and is forecast to show an annual rise of 5.1% - the fastest pace since the early 1980s.  "January inflation readings have surprised materially to the upside," said JPMorgan chief economist Bruce Kasman.  "We now look for the Fed to hike 25bp (basis points) at each of the next nine meetings, with the policy rate approaching a neutral stance by early next year."  At least six Fed officials are set to speak this week and markets will be hyper-sensitive to their views on a possible hike of 50 basis points in March.  Recent commentary has leant against such a drastic step and futures have scaled back the chance of a half-point rise to around 20% from well above 50% a week ago.  That helped short-term Treasuries pare a little of their losses last week, while the whole curve bull flattened as safe-haven buying pulled 10-year yields down to 1.9268% .  German 10-year government bonds  The euro zone economic recovery rebounded sharply this month as an easing of coronavirus restrictions gave a boost to the bloc's dominant service industry, according IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index,  In oil markets, Brent crude gained 28 cents to $93.80, while U.S. crude rose 23 cents to $91.30.  Oil had suffered its first weekly loss in two months last week, taking it off seven-year highs, amid tentative signs of progress on an Iran deal which could release new supply into the market.  An accord still looks distant, however, and is offset by the risk of sanctions against major oil producer Russia in the event of a Ukraine invasion.  Ministers from Arab oil-producing countries on Sunday rejected calls to pump more and said OPEC+ - the alliance of OPEC countries and other suppliers including Russia - should stick to its current agreement to add 400,000 barrels of oil per day.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/Illustration/File Photo  WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Russian military hackers were behind a spate of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline, the United States and the United Kingdom said on Friday.  U.S. deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told journalists at the White House that Washington was seeking to hold Russia to account for its aggressive moves in cyberspace.  "Russia likes to move in the shadows and counts on a long process of attribution," Neuberger said. "In light of that, we're moving quickly to attribute the DDoS attacks.

In a simultaneous announcement, British officials said the GRU was "almost certainly involved" in the DDoS, which works by flooding targeted websites with a firehose of data.  "The attack showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty," Britain's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement. "This activity is yet another example of Russia's aggressive acts against Ukraine."  "This disruptive behaviour is unacceptable," the FCDO said.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

The cadre of billionaires in charge of Russia’s biggest companies have for years been able to use London as their playground. A Russian invasion of Ukraine may change that.  Britain has long had ways to tighten up. Yet good ideas, like a register to show the true owners of London mansions held by shell companies, have taken ages to get going. A ban on so-called golden visas, whereby rich foreigners hand over millions of pounds for easy access to Britain, is only now being mooted.  Reforms in 2019 did target individuals for asset freezes and travel bans. But they narrowly focused on those involved in destabilising Ukraine. The names sanctioned thus far largely don’t include senior oligarchs and government figures identified by the United States as close to the Kremlin, like businessman Gennady Timchenko or Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Compare that to the U.S. “Specially Designated Nationals” list, on which oligarch Oleg Deripaska was placed in April 2018. This effectively turns the sanctioned party into kryptonite, as global banks that use the U.S. dollar system risk being sanctioned themselves if they deal with them. The joke was that even those recommending a restaurant to Deripaska could end up on the SDN list. The oligarch had to be tortuously disentangled from his global companies Rusal (RUAL.MM) and En+ to stop them being sanctioned too.  Still, as of Feb. 10 the UK is toughening its act. Under new amendments to the 2019 regulations, those who own or run companies can be sanctioned if they “have been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. That’s a pretty broad canvas, in some ways wider even than the U.S. equivalent. It also includes strategically significant industries such as mining and energy. While it lacks the deadly extra-territoriality of the U.S. SDN list, it could amount to a larger group of individuals to sanction and effectively block from entering Britain.  The real test, however, is in implementation. The UK Conservative Party has been responsible for the last decade’s weak approach, and still calls the shots now. Tory peer Greg Barker is an executive chairman of En+. It’s too soon to tell whether Ukraine will be a decisive game changer.

CONTEXT NEWS  - The United Kingdom has amended legislation to allow it to sanction companies benefitting from or supporting the Russian government, including economically important and strategically significant industries such as extractives and energy.  - The legislation also allows sanctioning many of the people who own or manage such companies. The Feb. 10 amendment of 2019 regulations also targets people and companies who are involved in destabilising Ukraine.  - Sanctioned people would have their UK assets frozen and would not be able to have funds made available to them in the country.  - The UK may also scrap its so-called “golden visa” regime used by Russian and other foreign investors to resettle in the UK, the Financial Times reported on Feb. 16.

PENTAGON SPOX GIVES EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS ON, OFF THE TABLE IN RUSSIA NEGOTIATIONS  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that while President Biden and Putin have accepted the meeting "in principle," Russia continues to indicate they are making preparations for "a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.  "President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened. We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon," Psaki said.  She added that President Biden is committed to pursuing diplomacy "until the moment an invasion begins."  "As the President has repeatedly made clear, we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins.

Biden was set to travel to Delaware Sunday to tend to a family-related issue, despite initially planning to stay in Washington D.C. over the weekend as the crisis between Ukraine and Russia escalated. The evolving plans come after a meeting with national security aides on Sunday, while the president spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron Sunday afternoon as tensions continue to flare between Russia and Ukraine .  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: ZELENSKYY URGES MORE ACTION BY WESTERN LEADERS AS TENSIONS MOUNT: LIVE UPDATES  The move comes after the Kremlin lashed out at NATO Sunday after Russian President Vladimir Putin's call with Macron, with the Russian leader accusing NATO of further enflaming tensions by providing Ukraine with military assistance.  "Serious concern was expressed over the sharp deterioration of the situation on the line of contact in the Donbass," read Russia's summary of Putin's call with Macron. "The president of Russia noted that the reason for the escalation is the provocations of the Ukrainian security forces. Attention is drawn to the ongoing pumping by the NATO countries of Ukraine of modern weapons and ammunition, which is pushing Kyiv towards a military solution to the so-called Donbass problem."  The call highlights NATO fears that Putin could use tensions on Ukraine's eastern frontier as a pretext for an invasion of the country, which Biden has warned could happen within days.  "As of this moment, I’m convinced that he’s made the decision," Biden said Friday of Putin's intentions to invade Ukraine. "We have reason to believe that."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Biden acknowledged that it was "hard to read" Putin's mind, but noted that U.S. intelligence shows that Russia is set on using a "false flag" operation as a justification to invade a country Putin has long believed belongs under Russian control.  But the president has also stressed that he believes "diplomacy is always a possibility" until the Russian military crosses into Ukraine.

NATO allies, including White House officials, are concerned by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s decision to depart Kyiv for the Munich Security Conference this weekend, sources told Fox News Friday.  Allies of the 30-member alliance are reportedly worried that Russia could exploit the president’s absence as tension in Eastern Europe has reached a boiling point not seen in decades.  STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS EVACUATIONS IN EASTERN UKRAINE 'FALSE FLAG OPERATIONS,' WARNS OF DISTRACTIONS  Zelensky, who is set to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday, is expected to be a key target if Russia does successfully invade Kyiv, sources confirmed.  Zelensky's office confirmed his plans to attend the Munich conference early Saturday but said he will return to Ukraine hours later, according to Reuters.  President Biden said Friday he is "convinced" that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine.  In answer to questions from reporters as to whether he believed it would be a mistake for Zelensky to leave Ukraine at this time Biden said, "It may not be…the wise choice, but it's his decision."  "That's a judgment for him to make," Biden said. "It's in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution."  A senior U.S. defense official told Fox News Digital there is a strong possibility of a "significant invasion" by the Russian military in the coming days and Kyiv is its sites.  The official said Russian military forces have left their barracks and that roughly 40-50% of Putin's troops have moved into attack positions — putting them within striking distance of the Ukrainian border.  Putin now has 120-125 Battalion Tactical Groups amassed along Ukraine's border. All Special Forces have been mobilized, and rocket forces along with ballistic missile units are within range of the capital.  Destabilization efforts that the U.S. and NATO have warned against "has begun," the senior U.S. defense official said.  Tensions in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have clashed with the Ukrainian military since 2014, mounted this week and resulted in an exchange of artillery shelling that began Thursday.  KYIV MAYOR PLEADS WITH US, GERMANY OVER THREAT OF RUSSIAN INVASION: 'WE CAN'T DEFEND OUR COUNTRY'  Leaders of two the separatist groups called for an evacuation of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and leaders of the self-proclaimed republics claimed Friday that Russia has allegedly agreed to host evacuees.  Ukrainian officials and Russian-backed separatists have blamed each other for the attacks.  The separatists Saturday declared a full military mobilization a day after women and children in the region had begun evacuating to southern Russia.  NATO allies are concerned Russia will use the violence there as a pretense to invade Ukraine.  The U.S. has not said who is responsible for the attacks, but officials have been sounding the alarm that Russia is laying the groundwork for an incursion.  The State Department this week pointed to false claims by Putin regarding human rights abuses, and a spokesperson told Fox News Digital the evacuation effort is just the latest "false flag operation."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Harris reaffirmed that the Biden administration remains committed to engaging with Moscow, but said the focus of the security talks will be in maintaining a united front to deter Russian aggression.  "We have made clear that we remain open to diplomacy," she said from Munich Friday. "The onus is on Russia at this point to demonstrate that it is serious in that regard."

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Sunday that despite evidence that Russia is preparing to strike Ukraine, the U.S. remains committed to pursuing a diplomatic solution, and Kirby illustrated what negotiations with the Kremlin could look like.  In an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," Kirby said that the Biden administration has "made serious proposals about ways that we can change things we’re doing in Europe," in order to address concerns of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

When asked by host Bill Hemmer what is off the table, Kirby specifically mentioned the issue of Ukraine joining NATO.  "That’s an issue for Ukraine and for NATO," Kirby said. "That’s not something that Mr. Putin can simply institute a veto over or decide for himself. That kind of thing is, again, between the alliance and Ukraine."

Presidents Day is used every year to celebrate all presidents of the U.S. and George Washington’s birthday, with some states also celebrating President Abraham Lincoln’s birthday.  As the U.S. honors the U.S. leaders, it’s fun to look back at the sporting achievements of some presidents.  Read below for a look at how some former presidents fared in the athletic arena.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  President Abraham Lincoln  The History Channel noted that President Lincoln was an amateur wrestler in the 1830s. "Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years, Vol. 1" detailed Lincoln wrestling and beating Jack Armstrong, who was a champion from a nearby town.  The National Wrestling Hall of Fame honored Lincoln in 1992 as an "Outstanding American."  President Theodore Roosevelt  President Roosevelt has been described as the ultimate sportsman. He was a boxer and a wrestler, and he played tennis and polo. He would regularly box at the White House and was injured by his military aide Col. Daniel T. Moore in a sparring session.  His sporting legacy has left an imprint on one of the greatest superstars of any professional sport – Tom Brady. The seven-time Super Bowl champion has quoted Roosevelt’s "Man in the Arena" speech and used the speech as the title for his ESPN documentary.  President William Taft  President Taft attended Yale in 1874 and competed in intramural wrestling. He was the heavyweight champion at one point during his time at the school.  According to the Miller Center, Taft was a solid baseball player, as well.  President Herbert Hoover  President Hoover attended Stanford University and became the student-manager for the baseball and football teams. He helped organize the rivalry football game between Stanford and the University of California-Berkeley, which is known as The Big Game.  The first game was played on March 19, 1892. Stanford won 14-10.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt  President Roosevelt attended Harvard and served as a cheerleader on the squad to help support the football team. He is among several presidents who served as cheerleaders during their time in college.  Roosevelt attended Harvard from 1900 to 1903.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower  President Eisenhower was a star running back at West Point in 1912 but he injured his knee in a game and never took the football field again.  He was also a boxer, cheerleader, and fencer. He practiced gymnastics during his time in college. Eisenhower said later in his life that not making the baseball team was one of his biggest regrets, according to Baseball Almanac.  President John F. Kennedy  President Kennedy went to Harvard after leaving Princeton.  Kenny made the swimming team but wasn’t a memorable athlete. His coaches in 1970 told The Crimson that Kennedy was "rather frail." He competed in the 100-meter backstroke and the 300-meter medley.  He also tried out for football and golf while he was a member of the school.  President Richard Nixon  President Nixon attended Whittier College in California starting in 1930. Nixon played for the school’s basketball team and was a bench player for the football team, according to the book "The Contender," which details Nixon’s Congressional years.  Nixon is in the Whittier College athletics Hall of Fame.  President Gerald Ford  President Ford was a standout center, linebacker and long snapper at the University of Michigan in the 1930s. The Wolverines were national champions during the 1932 and 1933 seasons. He won the Meyer Morton Award in 1932. The award was given to the Michigan player who showed the best development and promise at the spring practice from 1925 to 1949.  Ford was a part of the 1934 East-West Shrine Game and the 1935 Collegiate All-Star Game.  President Ronald Reagan  President Reagan excelled in football and swimming when he attended Eureka College in Illinois. He was able to attend the school on a partial football scholarship, according to the Miller Center.  Reagan portrayed George Gipp in the movie "Knute Rockne All American" in 1940.  President George H.W. Bush  President Bush was the team captain of the Yale University baseball team. He was on the team as a first baseman and helped the team make the first two College World Series in 1947 and 1948.  According to the National Archives, Bush was able to meet with Babe Ruth before a game during his senior season at Yale.  President Bill Clinton  President Clinton played two sports when he attended Oxford University.  He was a member of the Oxford University Basketball Club and the rugby union team. He is one of several NBA greats and former politicians to have played on the team.  George W. Bush  President Bush, like his father, was a cheerleader at Yale and also played on the rugby union team. He played fullback for the team in the late 1960s. Bush’s teammate Brit Kolar described Bush’s abilities to the Yale Daily News in 2006.  "What’s interesting was that he was a good enough athlete that he could play a skill position in rugby with relatively little experience," Kolar said. "He had running skills, tackling skills and especially kicking skills."  Bush was also a part-owner of the Texas Rangers in 1989 and sold his shares in 1998.  President Barack Obama  President Obama was a major sports fan. As a senator, he threw out the first pitch at a Chicago White Sox playoff game in 2005. By the time he took office in 2008, he had a basketball court installed at the White House. Kevin Durant and Scottie Pippen were among those who participated in games at the White House.  He invited the 1985 Chicago Bears Super Bowl-winning team to the White House since they weren’t able to go because of the Challenger Disaster two days after the team won Super Bowl XX.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  President Donald Trump  Before he was president, Trump was a three-sport athlete at the New York Military Academy. Accordng to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, one of those sports he excelled in was football.  Trump was later the majority owner of the United States Football League’s New Jersey Generals. The Generals were able to bring in the high-profile running backs Herschel Walker and Mike Rozier, as well as quarterback Doug Flutie, into the league in one of the most shocking moves in the brief battle between the NFL and USFL.  Trump had been blamed for the downfall of the league. According to ESPN, he urged the league to move the schedule to the fall and later the anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL. The USFL won the lawsuit but was awarded a final judgment of $1 which was later tripled to $3. The league folded before the 1986 season.  Trump also featured many big boxing fights at his Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos and pro golf championships at his resorts. He nearly bought the Buffalo Bills in 2014.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday said she believes sanctions on Russia would absolutely deter President Vladimir Putin, despite she and President Biden saying that he has already made up his mind on a potential invasion.  Harris made her remarks to reporters at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, amid fears of a Russian invasion in Ukraine. The vice president called the sanctions "some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest," that the U.S. has ever issued.  "As I articulated yesterday, it is directed at institutions — in particular, financial institutions — and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy and their government," Harris said.  KAMALA HARRIS MEETS WITH UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY, PLEDGES UNIFIED ACTION IF RUSSIA INVADES: ‘A DECISIVE MOMENT’  Her comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for the U.S. and allies to impose sanctions against Russia now -- before a potential invasion of Ukraine happens.  "We don't need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen, and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders or after we will have no economy or parts of our country will be occupied," Zelenskyy said at the security conference. "Why would we need those sanctions then?"  Harris was asked by a reporter if she felt the looming threat of sanctions would deter Putin, despite saying the president has already made a decision on Ukraine.  "Absolut- — we strongly believe — and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our Allies. And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because -- remember, also -- we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment," Harris said, according to the White House.  "And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, altho- — open, although it is absolutely narrowing — but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit," she added.  On Sunday, shelling in Ukraine increased in areas helped by Russia-backed rebels. Putin has amassed more than 150,00 Russian forces at the Ukrainian border and recently oversaw tests of nuclear-capable missiles.  KAMALA HARRIS SAYS RUSSIA WILL SUFFER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC COSTS IF IT INVADES UKRAINE: ‘SWIFT AND SEVERE’  Amid the current build-up of troops at the border, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said it appeared "Russia is preparing for an invasion of Ukraine."  While Stoltenberg stressed that while it was not too late to change course against an armed attack, the secretary-general noted there is a "new normal in European security."  On Sunday, Harris was asked during the security conference about how the U.S. would "disentangle" itself from the conflict after imposing sanctions and possible military action.  "I don’t — we don’t consider ourselves to be entangled," Harris said, adding that our purpose is to be aligned with our allies.  "I mean, let’s really take a moment to understand the significance of what we’re talking about. It’s been over 70 years. And through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security. We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe," she said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "So our position is, for us, very clear, which is as a leader — which we have been, bringing together the Allies, working together around our collective and unified position — that we would all not just prefer, we desire, we believe it is in the best interest of all that there is a diplomatic end to this moment. And so where do we want this to end? That is where we want it to end," Harris continued.  Russia has said that it has no plans to attack Ukraine.

"When America stands for principles, and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost," Harris said Sunday after a meeting with NATO leaders in Germany.  A RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WOULD MEAN GLOBAL ENERGY SHOCK  Harris said some of the costs to hit American pocket books "may relate to energy cost," with Russia being one of the world's leading producers of oil.  The vice president's comments come as Americans have already seen prices on common good rise thanks to a four-decade high in inflation, according to the consumer price index. Those price increases have been spread across almost all common goods, including medical care, clothing, transportation, food, and shelter.  But Harris stressed the need to push back against Russia's plans for invasion, saying that there was "the real possibility of war" in Europe not seen since the end of World War II.  "We’re talking about the potential for war in Europe. I mean, let’s really take a moment to understand the significance of what we’re talking about," Harris said.  "It’s been over 70 years, and through those 70 years ... there has been peace and security," she added. "We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe."  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  The administration has been warning for weeks that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent, with CBS reporting Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials say Russian commanders have received their orders to proceed with the invasion.  But the White House has not yet written off the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the stand-off, with Biden planning a meeting with Group of Seven leaders on Thursday to discuss the situation in Ukraine and a scheduled meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the works for this week

Canadians seeking Fox News’ coverage of the ongoing Freedom Convoy shouldn’t have a problem accessing America’s No. 1 basic cable network north of the border.  Fox News has been available in Canada and fully distributed there since 2004, giving Canadians an alternative to local media coverage of convoy protestors that has been widely criticized.  Fox News is available as a premium tier in some areas, with Bell, Rogers, Shaw, Telus, Sasktel, Videotron and Cogeco all offering the network. Fox News is also available to anyone with a cable provider that is a member of the Canadian Communication Systems Alliance (CCSA), a co-op of smaller cable operators.  CANADIAN STATE NEWS AGAIN SUGGESTS RUSSIAN FORCES BEHIND TRUCKER FREEDOM CONVOY  The protests began in Vancouver on Jan. 23. Hundreds of big rig trucks traveled to Ottawa where they were joined by thousands of Canadians in protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s coronavirus policies.  "They’re spinning their own narrative," Ontario-based trucker Brigitte Belton recently told Fox News Digital about the Canadian media’s coverage of the convoy.  Maine Expedited Freight group driver Brian Ilsley told Fox News Digital that most Canadian journalists live in a few densely populated, urban areas of the country and can’t relate to the protesting truckers.  "The vast majority of them don’t get it. They don’t understand the struggles of the guys that are out in the woods that are really driving this thing," Ilsley said.  BILL MAHER ON CANADA'S FREEDOM CONVOY: ‘THEY’RE NOT WRONG TO BE P---ED OFF' AT ELITES  Last month, producer Tara Henley resigned from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after claiming the network abandoned journalistic integrity to embrace "a radical political agenda." Henley, who identifies as a liberal herself, published her scathing resignation announcement on Substsack, detailing a newsroom stifled by far-left ideology that limits critical thinking and obsesses over race.  In recent days, the CBC hosts and guests have suggested the Canadian truckers protesting vaccine mandates were being "directed and manipulated by foreign agents."  Some of the more negative coverage of the protests has called the Freedom Convoy a "cult" and a "threat to democracy." The Ottawa Police Chief used the words "nationwide insurrection" to describe the protests, which were echoed by many in the media. Many headlines have also focused on " swastikas and public urination " and protesters carrying swastika and Confederate flags and defacing statues.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is pushing back on Russian demands and said flatly that "Ukraine is seeking membership in NATO" during an episode of CBS' "60 minutes."  Kuleba told CBS' Lesley Stahl that Ukraine is not backing down on its ambitions to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on an episode of "60 Minutes" that aired on Sunday.  He also said that Ukraine is not sending "signals" that it's willing to back down on its ambition to join NATO in an effort to meet one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands.  BIDEN AND PUTIN AGREE TO 'PRINCIPLE' OF SUMMIT DISCUSSING UKRAINE  "We are not sending such signals," Kuleba said, responding to a question from Stahl. "The majority of Ukrainians want Ukraine to become a member of NATO."  Instead, Kuleba said if Ukraine succeeds, the entire democratic world will be safer.  "The only signal we're sending to the world is that if Ukraine succeeds, and if Russia pulls back, it will be much safer for the entire democratic world," Kuleba said.  NATO ALLIES CONCERNED BY ZELENSKY MOVE TO LEAVE UKRAINE, THREAT OF RUSSIAN INVASION ALMOST CERTAIN  He added that the United States has not pressured Ukraine to abandon its plans to join NATO, but said "a few European members of NATO" have pressured them to pull back.  PENTAGON SPOX GIVES EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS ON, OFF THE TABLE IN RUSSIA NEGOTIATIONS  Kuleba said that a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine will come with "huge damage on Russia itself."  "Economically, because of sanctions that will be slammed on Russia immediately. Militarily, because we are not the country that will give up. This is our land, we will be defending it," Kuleba said. "You see, [Russia] tried to suffocate us, destabilize us, and shatter us from the inside for the last 300 years. But they failed. I'm still sitting here with you, a foreign minister of independent Ukraine. We know the threat, we understand it, we learned how to live with it, and we stand for a just cause," Kuleba said.  The comments come amid heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as Russia currently has over 150,000 troops along Ukraine's border.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE OUTCOME PRESENTS LITTLE UPSIDE FOR BIDEN, BUT ‘DOWNSIDE’ POSSIBLE: STRATEGISTS  Robert L. Wilkie, former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness during the Trump administration and visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, previously told Fox News Digital that China would play a role in mitigating any U.S. sanctions placed on Russia in the event Vladimir Putin authorizes any military action in Ukraine.

"[China] would start buying a lot more energy from Russia," Wilkie explained.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is baiting Ukraine with artillery shelling, cyber attacks, mysterious explosions in Eastern Ukraine and nuclear missile drills featuring bombers and hypersonic missiles.  With President Biden’s economic deterrence against Russia teetering, keep your eyes on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Russia is "uncoiling those forces and poised to strike," Austin said in Lithuania on Saturday. If Russia attacks, Biden will look to Austin to confirm it and recommend America’s next military move.  Austin, a retired Army four-star general, is by law the man who gives the president’s orders to the military. He’s the direct chain of command from Biden to U.S. and NATO forces in Europe (and around the world).  THIS IS BIDEN'S LAST CHANCE TO DETER PUTIN IN UKRAINE  All the crazy tactics from Putin’s playbook are no surprise to Austin.  Austin played it cool on his visit to Europe. He’s not about to be rattled by Russia’s attempts at provocation but he’s watching Putin like a hawk.  "We see some of those troops inch closer to that border," Austin said of Russian forces on Thursday. "We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft, we see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies."  But Austin is aware of Putin’s darker intent. "I was a soldier myself not that long ago," Austin said from Brussels. "I know first-hand you don’t do these sorts of things for no reason."  The U.S. military is still the glue for the international system. With the world watching, here are the six things Austin must continue to do.  Bolster NATO. Austin says he’s never seen NATO more united or resolute. In part, that’s because Austin is giving NATO members frequent tactical updates on where the 150,000 Russian forces are, and if they are in attack position or not. Speaking in Lithuania Saturday, Austin said he’s ready to send American forces if NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg activates the NATO response force.  Keep Ukraine Calm and Confident. That "situational awareness," as the military likes to say, is vital for Ukraine, too. Kyiv can downplay the Russian artillery firing on the ceasefire line in part because the NATO overwatch assures Ukraine that Russians aren’t crossing into Ukraine at the same moment. Sharing this tactical information, some of which is very sensitive, is part of Austin’s job and it’s a crucial ingredient for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s day-to-day decisions.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Stay Vigilant. Austin’s got this. Combat surveillance aircraft from the U.S. and NATO are saturating the skies from Helsinki to Istanbul right now. It’s a 1,300-mile air curtain with planes to listen for Russian tactical radio signals and monitor the 150,000 forces deployed by Putin. Austin has to keep ‘em flying, as he did by sending extra F-35 stealth fighters from Utah to Germany on Wednesday and adding select ground forces at eastern NATO bases.  Fight the Info War. In this first big war crisis of the social media age, information is everything. A splash of U.S. intelligence can unmask Putin’s plans. Austin must keep choosing the right intelligence to drop publicly from the White House, State Department, the Pentagon, etc. Each reveal of a Russian battle plan or "false flag" sabotage scheme peels away Putin’s options.  Make the Tough Calls on Russian provocations. The U.S. and Britain expect Russia will manufacture a crisis.

Credit card balances grew to $856 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, up $52 billion (6.5%) from the previous quarter. That's the largest quarterly increase observed since the NY Fed began collecting this data 22 years ago.  Outstanding credit card debt is still about 7.7% lower than it was at the end of 2019, when it hit an all-time high of $927 billion. That's because consumers paid down their credit card balances at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic — although they now appear to be resuming pre-pandemic spending habits.  If you're struggling to repay high-interest credit card debt, keep reading to learn about three strategies that could help you get out of debt fast. You can also compare a variety of financial products, from balance transfer cards to debt consolidation loans, on Credible's online marketplace.  DEBT SNOWBALL METHOD VS. DEBT AVALANCHE: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?  3 ways to get out of credit card debt  If you're among the millions of American consumers who added to their credit card balances at the end of 2021, you may be looking for ways to pay off your debt. Here are three debt repayment strategies that can help you slash your credit card balances fast:  Read more about each method for paying off credit card debt in the sections below.  1. Nonprofit credit counseling  Credit counseling agencies offer free or low-cost debt relief services to consumers who are struggling to manage their finances. A credit counselor may help you by:  Analyzing your income, expenses and outstanding debts to create a budget  Negotiating with creditors to lower your interest rates and waive fees  Signing you up for a debt management plan (DMP)  Under a DMP, a nonprofit credit counselor will work with your creditors on your behalf to consolidate your debts into a single monthly payment. Enrolling in a DMP typically comes with a monthly fee, which may be waived or lowered depending on your financial situation.  You can find a certified credit counselor through trade groups like the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) or the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA). You can also see a full list of accredited nonprofit credit counseling agencies on the Department of Justice website.  BEST CREDIT CARD CONSOLIDATION LOANS  2. Balance transfer cards  While credit counseling may be the preferred option for debtors with fair or bad credit, consumers with good credit can consider alternative debt repayment methods like credit card balance transfers.  A balance transfer is when you move your current credit card debt to a new account with better terms, such as a lower interest rate. You may be able to transfer the balance of one or more credit cards onto a single card using this method, although you may have to pay a balance transfer fee of 3-5% of the total amount.  As an added bonus, some credit card companies offer introductory 0% APR periods for balance transfers, which would effectively allow applicants to avoid paying interest on their credit card debt for that period of time. These offers typically last up to 18 months and are reserved for borrowers with very good to excellent credit, defined by the FICO model as a credit score of 740 or higher.  You can compare balance transfer credit cards, including ones with zero-interest offers, for free by visiting Credible.  BANKRUPTCY FILINGS CONTINUE TO DECLINE DESPITE SKYROCKETING CREDIT BALANCES  3. Debt consolidation loans  Debt consolidation loans are another popular way to pay off credit card balances. A debt consolidation loan is a type of unsecured, lump-sum personal loan that's repaid in monthly installments at a fixed interest rate.  The average rate on a two-year personal loan is 9.09%, according to the Federal Reserve. This is the lowest that personal loan rates have been in the history of the Fed's data. In comparison, the average credit card interest rate is 16.44%.  Thanks to lower interest rates and a consistent repayment schedule, credit card consolidation can save some borrowers thousands of dollars over time. Applicants with a good credit score will qualify for the lowest personal loan rates available, but debt consolidation loans may not be worthwhile for borrowers with bad or fair credit.  Personal loan interest rates can vary from one lender to another, so it's important to compare multiple offers if you're considering debt consolidation. You can browse current personal loan rates in the table below, and visit Credible to compare offers across multiple personal loan lenders at once without impacting your credit score.

Cassidy pointed to the Johns Hopkins study that showed lockdowns had no impact in reducing the death rate. Cassidy said politicians are responding to the fact Americans are sick of being told what to do by the federal government for things that seem to be, at best, a marginal benefit.  On Ukraine, Cassidy says the Biden policy has been disastrous. Regarding Germany and Nord Stream 2, Cassidy believes the Biden Administration has not given Germany assurances on replacing the energy they would acquire from Russia via the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if they were to agree to shut it down if Russia invades Ukraine. Cassidy also took issue with the Biden administration stopping US offshore leasing and wanting to stop all drilling for oil and gas on public lands. When asked about moving toward electric cars, Cassidy says he is ok with them but if you do a life cycle of the pollution that comes from the mining and the processing of the batteries, it eats away at a lot of the advantage on electric vehicles. Cassidy also said it is heartbreaking the way child labor is exploited in the Congo to get the natural resources needed for electric cars.

Details of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients all over the world are contained in the leak, which unmasks the beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn)* held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions.  The leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by Credit Suisse, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data.  We can reveal how Credit Suisse repeatedly either opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world.  Quick Guide Suisse secrets Show What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were "immoral". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it "strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices". Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.  They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine.  One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal.  The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,” the whistleblower source said in a statement. “The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders.”  The revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges over the past few years are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank. Composite: Guardian/David Levene  Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients.  “Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct.”  The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.  While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.  The timing of the leak could hardly be worse for Credit Suisse, which has recently been beset by major scandals. Last month, it lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, after he twice broke Covid-19 regulations.  That capped an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a loan scandal in Mozambique.  This month, Credit Suisse became the first major Swiss bank in the country’s history to face criminal charges – which it denies – relating to allegation it helped launder money from the cocaine trade on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia.  However, the repercussions of the leak could be much broader than one bank, threatening a crisis for Switzerland, which retains one of the world’s most secretive banking laws. Swiss financial institutions manage about 7.9tn CHF (£6.3tn) in assets, nearly half of which belongs to foreign clients.  The Suisse secrets project sheds a rare light on one of the world’s largest financial centres, which has grown used to operating in the shadows. It identifies the convicts and money launderers who were able to open bank accounts, or keep them open for years after their crimes emerged. And it reveals how Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws helped facilitate the looting of countries in the developing world.  Disgraced executives, fraudsters, traffickers – clients  When Ronald Li Fook-shiu approached a banker to open an account in 2000, he is unlikely to have been viewed as a run-of-the-mill client. A former chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city, where he was known as the “godfather of the stock market”. But he was perhaps better known for the time he spent in a maximum security prison.  Li’s career had ended in disgrace in 1990, when he was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for listing companies on the stock exchange. However, a decade later Li was nonetheless able to open an account that later held 59m CHF (£26.3m), according to the leak.  He has since died, but his case is one of dozens discovered by reporters appearing to show Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for clients who had serious convictions that might be expected to show up in due diligence checks. There are other instances in which Credit Suisse may have taken quick action after red flags emerged, but the case nonetheless shows that dubious clients have been attracted to the bank.  Ronald Li Fook-shiu was known as the ‘godfather of the stock market’. Composite: Guardian/Alamy  Like every other bank in the world, Credit Suisse professes to have stringent control mechanisms to carry out extensive due diligence on its customers to “ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld”. In banking parlance, such controls are called know-your-client or KYC checks.  A 2017 leaked report commissioned by Switzerland’s financial regulator shed some light on the bank’s internal procedures at that time. Clients would face intensified scrutiny when flagged as a politically exposed person from a high-risk country, or a person involved in a high-risk activity such as gambling, weapons trading, financial services or mining, the report said.  Relationship managers were expected to use external sources to verify customers and their risk levels, according to the leak, including news articles or databases such as the Thomson Reuters World-Check platform, which is used widely in the financial services sector to flag when people are arrested, charged, investigated or convicted of a serious crime.  Rodoljub Radulović.  Such controls might be expected to prevent a bank from opening accounts for clients such as Rodoljub Radulović, a Serbian securities fraudster indicted in 2001 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the leaked data identifies him as the co-signatory of two Credit Suisse company accounts. The first was opened in 2005, the year after the SEC had secured a default judgment against Radulović for running a pump-and-dump scheme.  One of Radulović’s company accounts held 3.4m CHF (£2.2m) before they closed in 2010. He was recently given a 10-year prison sentence by a court in Belgrade for his role trafficking cocaine from South America for the organised crime boss Darko Šarić. Radulović’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Due diligence is not only for new clients. Banks are required to continually reassess existing customers. The 2017 report said Credit Suisse screened customers at least every three years and as often as once a year for the riskiest clients. Lawyers for Credit Suisse told the Guardian these periodic reviews were introduced “more than 15 years ago”, meaning it was continually running due diligence on existing clients from 2007.  The bank might, therefore, have been expected to have discovered that its German client Eduard Seidel was convicted of bribery in 2008. Seidel was an employee of Siemens. As the multinational’s lead in Nigeria, he oversaw a campaign of industrial-scale bribery to secure lucrative contracts for his employer by funnelling cash to corrupt Nigerian politicians.  Eduard Seidel, convicted of bribery in 2008. Composite: Handout  After German authorities raided the Munich headquarters of Siemens in 2006, Seidel immediately confessed his role in the bribery scheme, though he said he had never stolen from the company or appropriated its slush funds. His involvement in the corruption led to his name being entered into the Thomson Reuters World-Check database in 2007.  However, the leaked Credit Suisse data shows his accounts were left open until at least well into the last decade. At one point after he left Siemens, one account was worth 54m CHF (£24m). Seidel’s lawyer declined to say whether the accounts were his. He said his client had addressed all outstanding matters relating to his bribery offences and wished to move on with his life.  The lawyer did not respond to repeated invitations to explain the source of the 54m CHF. Siemens said it did not know about the money and that its review of its own cashflows shed no light on the account.  While Credit Suisse said in its statement it could not comment on any specific clients, the bank said “actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed”.  In some instances, Credit Suisse is understood to have frozen accounts belonging to problematic clients. Yet questions remain about how quickly the bank moved to close them.  One client, Stefan Sederholm, a Swedish computer technician who opened an account with Credit Suisse in 2008, was able to keep it open for two-and-a-half years after his widely reported conviction for human trafficking in the Philippines, for which he was given a life sentence.  Stefan Sederholm. Composite: AFP  Sederholm’s crime first came to light in 2009, when police in Manila raided a storefront purporting to be the local chapter of the Mindanao Peoples’ Peace Movement, and discovered about 17 women in cubicles with webcams performing sex shows for foreign customers. He was convicted in 2011.  A representative for Sederholm said Credit Suisse never froze his accounts and did not close them until 2013 when he was unable to provide due diligence material. Asked why Sederholm needed a Swiss account, they said that he was living in Thailand when it was opened, adding: “Can you please tell me if you would prefer to put your money in a Thai or Swiss bank?”  Ferdinand and Imelda pillage the Philippines  Swiss banks have cultivated their trusted reputation since as far back as 1713, when the Great Council of Geneva prohibited bankers from revealing details about the fortunes being deposited by European aristocrats. Switzerland soon became a tax haven for many of the world’s elites and its bankers nurtured a “duty of absolute silence” about their clients affairs.  The custom was enshrined in statute in 1934 with the introduction of Switzerland’s banking secrecy law, which criminalised the disclosure of client banking information to foreign authorities. Within decades, wealthy clients from all over the world were flocking to Swiss banks. Sometimes, that meant clients with something to hide.  One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986.  Credit Suisse helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos open Swiss accounts under fake names. Composite: Guardian  It has long been known that Credit Suisse was one of the first banks to help the Marcoses ravage their own country and in one infamous episode even helped them open Swiss accounts under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered Credit Suisse and another bank to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines.  The leaked data contains an account that belonged to Helen Rivilla, an attorney convicted in 1992 for helping launder money on behalf of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite this, she was able to open a Swiss account in 2000, as was her husband, Antonio, who faced similar charges that were subsequently dropped.  It is hard to know how Credit Suisse could have missed the money-laundering case linking the couple to the corrupt Philippine leader, which was reported by the Associated Press. The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF (£3.6m) with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006.  One former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients. “The bank’s compliance departments [were] masters of plausible deniability,” they told a reporter from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of the coordinators of the Suisse secrets project. “Never write anything down that could expose an account that is non-compliant and never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”  The 2000s was also a decade in which foreign regulators and tax authorities became increasingly frustrated at their inability to penetrate the Swiss financial system. That changed in 2007, when the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld voluntarily approached US authorities with information about how the bank was helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade tax with secret accounts.  We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland. Swiss Bankers Association  Birkenfeld was viewed as a traitor in Switzerland, where banking whistleblowers are often held in contempt. However, a wide-ranging US Senate investigation later uncovered the aggressive tactics used by UBS and Credit Suisse, the latter of which was found to have sent bankers to high-end events to recruit clients, courted a potential customer with free gold, and in one case even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine.  The revelations sent shock waves through Switzerland’s financial sector and enraged the US, which pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing which of its taxpayers had secret Swiss accounts from 2014. That same year, Switzerland reluctantly signed up to the international convention on the automatic exchange of banking Information.  By adopting the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) for sharing tax data, Switzerland in effect agreed that its banks would in the future exchange information about their clients with tax authorities in foreign countries. They started doing so in 2018.  Membership of the global exchange system is often cited by Switzerland’s banking industry as a turning point. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association told the Guardian. “We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.”  Switzerland’s almost 90-year-old banking secrecy law, however, remains in force – and was recently broadened. The Tax Justice Network estimates that countries around the world collectively lose $21bn (£15.4bn) each year in tax revenues because of Switzerland. Many of those countries will be poorer nations that have not signed up to the CRS data exchange.  Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. Composite: Guardian Design  More than 90 countries, most of which are in the developing world, remain in the dark when their wealthy taxpayers hide their money in Swiss accounts.  This inequity in the system was cited by the whistleblower behind the leaked data, who said the CRS system “imposes a disproportionate financial and infrastructural burden on developing nations, perpetuating their exclusion from the system in the foreseeable future”.  “This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue. These countries are the ones that therefore suffer most from Switzerland’s reverse-Robin-Hood stunt,” they said.  The whistleblower acknowledged that the leak would contain accounts that were legitimate and declared by the client to their tax authority.  “I am aware that having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime,” they said. “However, it is likely that a significant number of these accounts were opened with the sole purpose of hiding their holder’s wealth from fiscal institutions and/or avoiding the payment of taxes on capital gains.”  It was not possible for journalists in the Suisse secrets project to establish how many of the more than 18,000 accounts in the leak were declared to relevant tax authorities.

Media partners in the consortium wrote to more than 100 Credit Suisse clients in the data, asking whether they had disclosed their Swiss accounts to tax authorities. Five confirmed they had done so. Six said they were not required to declare their Swiss accounts. No others replied.  Links to another dictator … and another  Ferdinand Marcos may have been Credit Suisse’s most notorious client. He is arguably rivalled only by relatives of the brutal Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, who is believed to have stolen as much as $5bn from his people in just six years. It has long been known that Credit Suisse provided services to Abacha’s sons, opening Swiss accounts in which they deposited $214m.  Credit Suisse was publicly contrite after being kicked off a sustainable investment index over the affair. “We understand that the index was not really happy with us being involved with Abacha – we were not happy ourselves,” a spokesperson said in 1999. “But we have addressed those problems and for several years we have taken internal measures to make sure nothing similar happens in the future.”  Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets.  Politicians and state officials are among the riskiest customers for banks because of their access to public funds, particularly in developing nations with fewer legal safeguards against corruption. Banks and other financial institutions are required to subject politically exposed persons, or PEPs, to the most stringent checks, known as “enhanced due diligence”.  The leaked Credit Suisse data is peppered with politicians and their allies who have been linked to corruption before, during or after they had their accounts. None are as well known as the Marcoses or the Abachas, but several wielded great power in countries from Syria to Madagascar, where they amassed personal fortunes.  They include Pavlo Lazarenko, who served a corrupt single year as prime minister of Ukraine between 1997 and 1998 before applying for an account at Credit Suisse. One month after pressure from rivals forced Lazarenko to announce his resignation, he opened his first of two Credit Suisse accounts. One was later valued at almost 8m CHF (£3.6m).  Pavlo Lazarenko, former Ukrainian prime minister. Composite: Guardian/Alamy  Lazarenko was later estimated by Transparency International to have looted $200m from the Ukrainian government, allegedly by threatening to harm businesses unless they paid him 50% of their profits. He pleaded guilty to money laundering in Switzerland in 2000, and was later indicted in the US for corruption and sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 in relation to bribes received from a Ukrainian businessman.  His lawyer said those convictions did not relate to the theft of any money from the people of Ukraine. Lazarenko, who reportedly lives in California, has resisted returning to the country, where he still faces accusations he stole $17m. His lawyer said his Credit Suisse accounts had not been accessed for two decades and were frozen in connection with court proceedings against him.  It remains unclear why Credit Suisse allowed Lazarenko to open an account and deposit such huge sums in the first place, given his background; before entering politics, Lazarenko was a functionary in charge of a collective farm.  Monika Roth, an expert on money laundering and a professor at Lucerne University, said Swiss banks had for a long time struggled to properly challenge politicians and public officials who, after stints in public office on relatively modest salaries, turned up with huge sums to deposit. She said: “Nobody wants to have asked the question: how is that possible?”  Around the time it was doing business with Lazarenko, Credit Suisse appears to have also made inroads into the Egyptian political establishment under the dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was president for three decades until 2011. The bank’s clients included Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, who established business empires in Egypt.  Alaa and Gamal Mubarak. Composite: Guardian  The brothers’ relationship with the bank spanned decades, with the earliest joint account opened by the brothers in 1993. By 2010 – the year before the popular revolt that ousted their father – an account belonging to Alaa held 232m CHF (£138m).  After the Arab spring uprisings their fortunes changed, and in 2015 the brothers and their father were sentenced to three years in jail by an Egyptian court for embezzlement and corruption. They say the case was politically motivated, but after an unsuccessful appeal Alaa and Gamal paid an estimated $17.6m to the Egyptian government in a settlement agreement that made no admissions of guilt.  Lawyers for the brothers reject any suggestion they were corrupt, saying their rights were violated during the Egyptian case, and 10 years of wide-ranging and intrusive investigations into their global assets by foreign authorities has not uncovered any legal violations. They added that their Swiss accounts had been frozen for over a decade, pending the resolution of investigations by the Swiss authorities.  Other Credit Suisse clients linked to Hosni Mubarak were the late tycoon Hussein Salem – who acted as a financial consigliere for the dictator for nearly three decades, amassed a fortune through preferred tender deals and died in exile after facing money-laundering charges – and Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a billionaire politician in Mubarak’s party.

Composite: AP/EPA  Moustafa, who could not be reached for comment, was convicted in 2009 of hiring a hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend, the Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim – but his account was not closed until 2014.  Another Mubarak henchman linked to Credit Suisse’s banking services was his former spy chief Omar Suleiman. His associates are listed in the data as beneficial owners of an account that held 63m CHF (£26m) in 2007. Suleiman was a feared figure in Egypt, where he oversaw widespread torture and human rights abuses.  Omar Suleiman.

One Algerian client was Khaled Nezzar, who served as minister of defence until 1993 and participated in a coup that precipitated a brutal civil war in which the military junta he was part of was accused of disappearances, mass detentions, torture and execution of detainees.  Nezzar’s alleged role in human rights abuses had been widely documented by 2004, when his account was opened. It contained a maximum balance of 2m CHF (£900,000) and remained open until 2013, two years after he was arrested in Switzerland for suspected war crimes. He denies wrongdoing and the investigation is ongoing.  If ordinary Algerians, Egyptians and Ukrainians have reason to complain that Credit Suisse may have aided nefarious leaders, their grievances pale in comparison with Venezuelans.  Khaled Nezzar. Composite: Guardian  Reporters working on the Suisse secrets project identified Credit Suisse accounts linked to almost two dozen business people, officials and politicians implicated in corrupt schemes in Venezuela, most of which revolved around the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).  “Corruption has always been around in PDVSA, in varying degrees and levels,” said César Mata-Garcia, an academic at the University of Dundee specialising in international petroleum law. “The words ‘Venezuela’, ‘PDVSA’ and ‘oil’ are an alarm bell for banks.”  If so, that does not appear to have stopped Credit Suisse acquiring clients later revealed to be involved in numerous US investigations and prosecutions linked to PDVSA and the looting of the Venezuelan economy.  One case involves two US-based businessmen with Venezuelan connections, Roberto Rincón Fernández and Abraham Shiera Bastidas, who in 2009 set about bribing officials in exchange for lucrative PDVSA contracts with the help of an associate, Fernando Ardila Rueda. Among those who allegedly received bungs were the energy vice-minister, Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, and a senior PDVSA official, Luis De Léon Perez.  From left: Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, Roberto Rincón Fernández, Abraham Shiera Bastidas and Luis De Léon Perez. Composite: Guardian  In 2015, US prosecutors began indicting the participants; court papers make repeated reference to payments into accounts in an unnamed Swiss bank. However, the leaked data reveals all five men had Credit Suisse accounts active at the time of the offences. Of the five, four have pleaded guilty. The exception, Villalobos, is resisting extradition to the US from Spain.  Some of the Venezuela-linked Credit Suisse accounts contained enormous sums; Villalobos had as much as 9.5m CHF (£6.3m) in his account and De Léon had as much as 22m (£15.5m). Rincón, the businessman paying their bribes, had more than 68m CHF (£44.2m) in his account as of November 2015, the month prior to his arrest.  ‘How many rogue bankers before you become a rogue bank?’  When Credit Suisse’s ornate headquarters were constructed in the 1870s in Zurich, they were designed to symbolise “Switzerland as a financial centre”. More than 150 years later, Credit Suisse occupies the same grand premises and Switzerland remains a global offshore centre, much as it has done for the last 300 years.  It is only in recent decades that Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s oldest and most cherished banks, acquired its reputation for calamity. As one commentator observed earlier this week: “The bank boasts that its purpose is to serve its wealthy clients ‘with care and entrepreneurial spirit’, but at this stage most of them would probably be happy if it could just avoid yet another major scandal.”  Horta-Osório lasted less than a year before resigning last month. Shortly after Credit Suisse appointed its new chairman, Axel Lehmann, the bank reported a loss of 1.6bn CHF (£1.3bn) in the fourth quarter, in part because it had put aside more than 400m CHF (£320m) to deal with unspecified “legacy litigation matters”.  And there is no shortage of those. The scandals involving Greensill, Archegos and Mozambique bonds have dogged the bank over the past year.  Over the past three decades, Credit Suisse has faced at least a dozen penalties and sanctions for offences involving tax evasion, money laundering, the deliberate violation of US sanctions and frauds carried out against its own customers that span multiple decades and jurisdictions. In total, it has racked up more than $4.2bn in fines or settlements.  Some of the accounts in the leak remain open today. Composite: Guardian  That includes the $2.6bn the Swiss bank agreed to pay US authorities after pleading guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion in 2014; the $536m it was fined by the US five years before for deliberately circumventing US sanctions against countries including Iran and Sudan in 2009, and other payouts to Germany and Italy over tax evasion allegations.  Against this backdrop, the Suisse secrets revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank.  Jeff Neiman, a Florida-based attorney who represents a number of Credit Suisse whistleblowers, believes the sheer number of scandals involving the bank indicates a deeper problem.  “The bank likes to say it’s just rogue bankers. But how many rogue bankers do you need to have before you start having a rogue bank?” he said. Neiman alleges there has been a culture at the bank “which encourages its bankers probably from the top down to hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, bury their heads in the sand on a good day, and on many days, actively assist folks to skirt whatever the law may be in order to best protect assets under management”.”  Such allegations are strongly rejected by Credit Suisse. “In line with financial reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime,” the bank said in its statement, adding that it upheld “the highest standards of conduct”.  Its lawyers said it had fully cooperated with many of the investigations cited by the Guardian and that any past individual failings by the bank did not reflect its current business policies, practices or culture. In November, it announced it would put “risk management at the very core of the bank”.  The bank said its “preliminary review” of the accounts flagged by the Suisse secrets reporting project had established that more than 90% of those reviewed were now closed or “were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries”. Of the remaining accounts, which remain active, the bank said it was “comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken, including pending account closures”.  The Credit Suisse statement added: “These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years.”  The debate over whether Switzerland’s banking industry has undergone sufficient reforms is likely to be renewed in light of the leak. The whistleblower who shared the data suggested that banks alone should not be blamed for the state of affairs, as they are “simply being good capitalists by maximising profits within the legal framework they operate in”.  “Simply put, Swiss legislators are responsible for enabling financial crimes and – by virtue of their direct democracy – the Swiss people have the power to do something about it. While I am aware that banking secrecy laws are partly responsible for the Swiss economic success story, it is my strong opinion that such a wealthy country should be able to afford a conscience.”  * Currency conversions are based on historical rates.

In a call with Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine for the evacuation of the Donbas citizens, saying that because of Ukraine’s actions “civilians in the Donbas are suffering, and have to then have to be evacuated to Russia to protect them the from growing violence”.    Ukrainian officials have repeatedly dismissed any intention of mounting an attack in the eastern Donbas region while US president Joe Biden said it “defies basic logic” for Ukraine to try to reclaim the Donbas territory with an estimated 150,000 Russian forces now massed on their nation’s borders.  Western officials continue to warn that the Russian-backed separatist leaders have been reporting false events and staging incidents intended to provide Moscow with an excuse to start an offensive in Ukraine.    Over the weekend, pro-Moscow separatists repeatedly accused the Ukrainian military of shelling in eastern Ukraine, accusations Kyiv flatly denied.  The Ukrainian military said on SundayRussian-backed separatists in the Luhansk region had opened fire with heavy artillery on their own capital with the aim of blaming the Ukrainian military.

The Élysée Palace put out a statement on Sunday evening following last-minute diplomatic efforts by the French president to try to dissuade Russia from invading Ukraine.  “Presidents Biden and Putin have each accepted the principle of such a summit,” the statement said. “Its content will be prepared by secretary of state Blinken and Minister [Sergei] Lavrov during their meeting on Thursday 24 February. It can only be held if Russia does not invade Ukraine.”  The White House confirmed Biden’s readiness to hold a summit, but made clear it was wary about the sincerity of the offer.  “President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened, the White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said. “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.”  A satellite image taken on Sunday showing troops deployed along the tree line near Belgorod in Russia. Photograph: Maxar Tech/AFP/Getty Images  There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin or the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  Macron spoke twice to Vladimir Putin overnight, for a total of nearly three hours, consulting Joe Biden for 15 minutes in between the two calls. Amid a rising sense of urgency, the second Macron-Putin call was announced well after 2am in Moscow.  The French president said he was seeking to establish a cease-fire in the east of the country, and that the two leaders had agreed to hold discussions in the hope of organising a leaders’ summit to review the future of European security arrangements. But the Kremlin account of the conversation focused on Putin’s allegations of Ukrainian escalation and shelling on the eastern front lines – claims contradicted by reports from the region. It did not respond to an offer of direct talks from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president.  Moscow rescinded its undertaking to end military exercises in Belarus which were due to conclude on Sunday, and the Belarus defence ministry said the Russian troops would remain there indefinitely. Satellite images showed more and more Russian combat units advance from staging area to within a few kilometres of the Ukrainian border, in many cases concealing themselves in forests. More than 150,000 Russian troops are estimated to be deployed around Ukraine, while substantial naval forces are off its Black Sea coast.

Photograph: Maxar Tech/AFP/Getty Images  Biden had been planning to travel to Delaware for a family event on Monday, a public holiday in the US, but canceled the trip on Sunday evening following a rare Sunday meeting of the national security council. US news networks cited intelligence assessment saying that Moscow had issued attack orders to commanders on the ground.  The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, said: “Everything we are seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion.”.  He added: “...Until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President (Vladimir) Putin from carrying this forward.”  Earlier, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who also spoke to Macron on Sunday, warned that Russia plans to launch the biggest war in Europe since 1945 by attacking Ukraine in a “bloody and protracted conflict”. He said the west would use “all the pressure we can bring” to “make sure that this venture does not succeed”.  The chink of diplomatic light came after Putin spoke on the phone with Macron, his favoured western interlocutor, on Sunday morning, and the outcome, broadly confirmed by the Kremlin, suggests Putin might be willing to step back from the brink of a full invasion of Ukraine to allow renewed diplomatic discussions. If he is not, he is instead involved in an elaborate deceit of the French.  Under the plan, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday to work on the possible summit at the highest level with Russia, Ukraine and allies, the Élysée said.  The two leaders also agreed to resume work on a separate meeting “within the framework of the Normandy format”, meaning the participants will be Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, Macron’s office and the Kremlin said.  Putin and Macron would also work “intensively” to allow the Trilateral Contact Group – which includes Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe – to meet “in the next few hours” in an effort to secure a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine where government troops and pro-Russian separatists are facing each other, according to the Elysée statement.  It is too early to say if Macron has pulled off a last-minute diplomatic coup, or if he will have the full support for his initiative from London. So far, most of the French president’s diplomatic moves have been coordinated with the White House.  Gérard Araud, a former French diplomat, defended Macron, saying: “he is today the only western leader actively engaged in finding a peaceful way out of the current crisis. He does know that he may fail, and probably will, but he is right to try, and deserves our support and understanding.”  The Élysée statement said “intense diplomatic work will take place in the coming days”, including several consultations in the French capital, adding that the two leaders also agreed on “the need to favour a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis and to do everything to achieve one”.  An Élysée official confirmed further talks between the two leaders were scheduled, but said Putin and Macron clearly had “different interpretations” of what was happening in the Donbas region and who was to blame, with the French president arguing that pro-Russian separatists were responsible, and the Russian leader insisting it was Ukrainian forces.  The Élysée official said Macron would be talking “in the next few hours” to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Further calls were likely to be placed to Johnson, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, and other close partners, the official said.  They added that Putin had reiterated that Russia “intends to withdraw its troops” from Belarus once ongoing exercises were complete. “All this will have to be verified, and that could take some time,” the official said, noting that statements by the Belarus authorities “do not appear to match Putin’s words”.  The Belarusian defence minister said Russia and Belarus were extending military drills that were due to end on Sunday, in a step that further intensifies pressure on Ukraine.  The Kremlin said that in the phone call, Putin had expressed serious concern over the sharp deterioration of the situation on the line of contact in Donbas.  The Russian statement added: “Taking into account the acuteness of the current state of affairs, the presidents considered it expedient to intensify the search for solutions through diplomatic means through the foreign ministries and political advisers to the leaders of the countries participating in the Normandy format. These contacts are designed to help restore the ceasefire and ensure progress in resolving the conflict around Donbas.”  The Kremlin insisted Putin was not withdrawing any of his wider demands, saying he “reiterated the need for the United States and Nato to take Russian demands for security guarantees seriously and respond to them concretely and to the point”. It made no reference to Macron’s proposed leaders’ summit.  The statement added that Putin blamed the escalation in Donbas on the provocations of the Ukrainian security forces, and that he complained of the continuing provision of modern weapons and ammunition to Ukraine by Nato countries, “which is pushing Kyiv towards a military solution to the so-called Donbas problem”.

It was because the groups were being run by scam artists.  Networks of spammers and profiteers, some based as far afield as Vietnam or Romania, had set up the groups using fake or hacked Facebook accounts in an attempt to make money off of the political turmoil.  That foreign networks of social media scammers had seized on a divisive political issue may feel like somewhat of a throwback. Before investigations into Russian troll factories’ operations during the US presidential election and culture war conflicts over content moderation, one of the biggest challenges facing social media platforms was profiteers pushing fake news articles and spam for easy money. Hundreds of websites mimicking US news outlets pushed their content on social media, reaping ad revenue from the traffic they generated.  Platforms like Facebook have cracked down on such “inauthentic activity” since 2016, but the global misinformation industry remains. In recent years, these for-profit disinformation networks have seized on the popularity of conspiracy movements and far-right groups online, creating content aimed at anti-vaccine protesters and QAnon followers.  “It can be an extremely lucrative industry for people in other parts of the world to very closely monitor US and Canadian political climates, then capitalize on moment-to-moment trends,” Emerson Brooking, a senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, told the Guardian. “If you’re out for money, and measure success not by sowing discord in a country but by maximizing ad revenue, there’s still a lot of benefit to these operations.”  Scammers use fake or compromised accounts to generate ad revenue by pushing anti-vaccine or QAnon content. Photograph: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/Rex/Shutterstock  Disinformation for profit  It is hard to know the exact scale of the for-profit misinformation industry, researchers say, since it functions as part of an underground economy and comes in various forms. In addition to content mills and ad revenue schemes, there are also private firms across the globe that are hired to create fake engagement or push political propaganda. In 2021 alone, Facebook said it removed 52 coordinated influence networks across 32 countries that attempted to direct or corrupt the public debate for strategic goals, according to a company report on inauthentic behavior.  In addition, small networks can have an outsized impact if they effectively use online groups to mass organize and fundraise. In the case of the Freedom Convoy accounts, many of the largest Facebook groups involved appeared to be run by fake accounts or content mills hailing from numerous countries. Facebook took down the groups this month, but not before supporters of the convoy raised over $7m in crowdfunding and generated mass mainstream attention. (GoFundMe later disabled the campaign).  A Bangladeshi digital marketing firm ran two of Facebook’s largest anti-vaccine trucker groups, according to Grid News, which had over 170,000 members combined before the platform removed them. The hacked Facebook account of a Missouri woman set up a network of several other pro-demonstration groups, collectively gaining more than 340,000 members in weeks. Other groups promoting American spinoffs of the Canadian protests were from Facebook accounts and networks based in Vietnam, Romania and other nations, Facebook officials told NBC News.  But recent research has shed light on how some of these for-profit misinformation operations work. A series of case studies from the Institute For Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank, detailed what it takes to run a money-making online news scam. One example was a cobbled-together website called The U.S. Military News.  The headlines on The U.S. Military News look much like those you might find on any number of far-right media outlets, with titles like “Trump Wrecks Pence In Awesome Statement” and articles praising the Canadian trucker protests. A shop on the site markets Trump-related merchandise including free American flags and Trump 2024 “Revenge Tour” commemorative coins. There are repeated pleas for donations all over the front page and attached to every article.  But despite the name and wall-to-wall American branding, the site has no connection to the US military, or the United States for that matter. Its domain is registered in Vietnam, and it’s unclear if it employs any writers or if the products it advertises even exist. The articles themselves consist solely of stock footage videos, with an automated voice reading plagiarized content.  Police on horseback and an armored police vehicle are positioned in front of protesters during protests in Ottawa on Friday. Photograph: Justin Tang/AP  A number of the articles and headlines posted on sites linked to the network veer into outright QAnon conspiracy content, featuring falsehoods about military tribunals and Biden officials being sentenced to death. One site’s front page prominently features a range of anti-vaccine and pro-Trump conspiracy content, while also promoting an Amazon affiliate link to Trump’s Art Of The Deal book.  The Guardian contacted the email address that The U.S. Military News is registered under, but did not receive a reply. The U.S. Military News is just one of a number of sites that appear linked to the same Vietnam-based network, according to ISD.  In another of ISD’s reports, researcher Elise Thomas found a network of dozens of Facebook groups and pages – which also appear to be linked to a small group of people in Vietnam – that shared plagiarized pro-Trump content aimed at conservative social media users. Taking articles from far-right conspiracy sites like The Gateway Pundit, the network created Facebook groups with names like “Conservative Voices” and built up large numbers of followers – sometimes in the tens of thousands of users.  Although for-profit misinformation networks often monetize their audiences through running ads on their websites, the network ISD found appeared to be building up their Facebook group members in order to potentially resell the groups themselves.  “This was the original threat that platforms were worried about,” Brooking said. “It wasn’t disinformation, you would characterize it as sort of ad fraud or ad farming.”  The original ‘fake news’  In many cases, including ISD’s case studies, there isn’t vast amounts of money being made from inauthentic Facebook groups and conspiracy sites. But to many of the operators based in countries with low per capita income relative to the US, making a few hundred dollars a month from pushing conspiratorial content means significant gain. One of the more lucrative sites linked to Vietnam that ISD analyzed brought in around $1800 each month through advertising alone – around 10 times the monthly per capita income in the country.  These scams have strong echoes of the surge in online commercial misinformation in 2016. Many of the people behind posts with false claims such as “Pope Francis Endorses Donald Trump” also came from outside the US, often from a single small town in North Macedonia called Veles which was responsible for over 140 imitation news websites.  These original “fake news” websites capitalized on salacious headlines and social media algorithms that promoted posts with high engagement regardless of their content, leading creators to choose contentious political issues involving race, religion and culture war flashpoints to drive the most attention to their sites and social media accounts. Although the strategies to evade content moderators have evolved, that playbook of monetizing conspiracies and misinformation appears to have stayed largely the same.  “This is what the misinformation threat looked like before we were even talking about state actions,” Brooking said. “It’s interesting that this sort of older threat is now back in center stage.”

Barely an hour after they checked in to their guest house, a message came: “Chairman Mao wants to see president Nixon.”  The urgency from Mao resonated with the excitement from the American delegation. The establishment of bilateral relations offered great opportunities for both sides in facing a common enemy: the Soviet Union. For more than two decades since the Chinese communists took over the mainland, Beijing and Washington had had no official contact on this scale.  Much to his surprise, Lord was asked to go along into the meeting with Mao as a note-taker. Secretary of state William Rogers not asked to attend and, so as not to upset Rogers, Nixon ordered Lord to be cropped out of the official photograph released to the press.  “The meeting took place in Mao’s residence, in a medium-sized room filled with books and manuscripts, like a library,” Lord recalled in an interview with the Guardian. “The atmosphere was modest, compared to the enormity of the event.  “Mao [also] bantered about how he and Chiang Kai-shek were enemies,” but Mao viewed it as essentially a “family quarrel”, Lord regaled, referring to the leader of the nationalists who fled to Taiwan after the defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949.  At the China-US talks in 1972 are (from left): Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, interpreter Nancy Tang, chairman Mao, president Nixon, national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Winston Lord and Mao’s grandniece, Wang Hairong. Illustration: Winston Lord  He continued: “[Mao] said, ‘We don’t have to solve difficult problems – he didn’t say Taiwan specifically, but that’s what he was referring to – immediately.’ So basically he was saying we can postpone the Taiwan issue while we get on with areas we agree on, for example balancing the Soviet Union.”  The week-long visit concluded with the signing of the Shanghai communique. On 27 February 1972, the United States “acknowledged” that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China”. The US also reaffirmed “its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves”.  The trip was hailed as much a diplomatic breakthrough as a TV spectacular. When he landed at Andrews air force base outside Washington after the week in China, Nixon received a hero’s welcome led by his vice-president, Spiro Agnew. Life Magazine’s Hugh Sidey recalled the murmur of a fellow journalist next to him at the airport: “My God, it’s like the arrival of the king.” Years later, the visit inspired an opera.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian  Half a century on, this event has lost its sparkle in both capitals. In Washington, critics now question the wisdom of Nixon’s 1972 trip; many see China as an economic threat and – like Russia - a geopolitical enemy. In Beijing, there’s an increasingly louder view that the US is in its terminal decline and China’s system is ultimately superior. On 4 February, the leaders of China and Russia declared: “there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation’,” in a clear message to the US.  This month, as both countries mark the anniversary, Washington has been embroiled in a mind game with Moscow over whether Vladimir Putin is to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beijing, at the same time, was keen to remind Washington of what it sees as the biggest achievement of Nixon’s trip: the Shanghai communique and the status of the island of Taiwan.  Speaking at a press conference on 10 February, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, emphasised to his audience the phrase of “one China” – which in Beijing is called a “principle” but in Washington a “policy” – and said the document was “the political foundation for the normalisation of China-US relations and the establishment of diplomatic ties”.  In January, China’s ambassador to Washington, Qin Gang, warned that the Taiwan issue was “the biggest tinderbox” between the two countries. He made it explicit that the US and China could face a military conflict “[i]f the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence”.

It does not endorse Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taipei, nor does it regard the island as an independent country. Washington, however, is committed by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. Yet as the relations have soured, some – such as the Republican senator Ted Cruz – have suggested the US should make its commitment to Taiwan more explicit.  The advocacy from Taipei is becoming more proactive, too. As the world watches the fate of Ukraine, Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, warned that Beijing “might be thinking about a military attack against Taiwan” after the Winter Olympics. “We are not asking for war … but we won’t bow to China,” he vowed.  Some see the current state of play as inevitable and reflecting a structural issue between an incumbent power and a rising power. But Washington’s rethink of its China strategy began more than two decades ago when George Bush’s defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, presented him with a proposal to shift the US’s global strategic priorities towards Asia – and primarily China.  “Many thought that once [Donald] Trump left the White House, tensions between the US and China would have decreased,” said Zeno Leoni of King’s College London and the author of American Grand Strategy from Obama to Trump. “However, the fallout at the Anchorage summit in Alaska, the endurance of trade sanctions, and a boycott of Olympic Games not seen since the cold war confirms that problems are structural.”  Richard Nixon and then-first lady Pat Nixon lead the way as they tour China’s Great Wall near Beijing during the 1972 visit. Photograph: AP  Leoni saw a pattern in American grand strategy that encourages other countries, including former and potential rivals – Germany, Japan, China – to act as “locomotives” of a global economy that favours US interests. “However, this strategy has led to several ‘blowbacks’ in recent decades, including the rise of China,” he said.  Lord insists Nixon’s approach to China half a century ago was “a brilliant strategic move”. “What was the alternative?” he asked. “If we didn’t open up to China, we certainly wouldn’t have had … the arms control agreement that we had within months with the Soviet Union. We would not have had either China’s or the Soviets’ help as much on ending the Vietnam war. We would not have restored American credibility at home and abroad.  “The thing that China would never have emerged without our help is nonsense,” Lord continued. “Given the size of the Chinese population and the talents of the Chinese people, it clearly was going up sooner or later. When they began to emerge, what was the alternative? Trying to contain China? In addition to this being dangerous, it was impossible, because other countries wouldn’t join us. It would be ineffective.”  But Leoni said whether Nixon’s China visit in 1972 was mistaken or not depended on whether we wanted to take the long view in history. “That meeting led to great global economic growth and to the end of the cold war. Yet it also was a selfish move that benefited the US, and the long-term implications of the rapprochement were not thought through enough at the time.”  The Guardian’s front page on 22 February 1972 covering the Nixon trip. Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian  The stakes are high, and mismanagement of the US-China relationship is “arguably the biggest short-term threat to peace”, said Robert Daly of the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington. For more than 30 years, Daly has been observing the evolution of the bilateral relationship from both capitals.  Daly said observers tend to think of Nixon’s visit only as a big geopolitical chess game, but more significantly, that week in February 50 years ago opened the “floodgate” for people-to-people exchange. “It gave the people of both countries permission to interact.”  “Before 1972, the two countries saw each other only through the lens of security. After Nixon’s visit, they began to view one another in their full humanity,” Daly said. “Sadly, we are now reverting back to seeing each other solely through a security lens.”  Lord, now 84, said he did not agree with the prevailing view in Washington these days that America’s engagement with China had failed. He said the two countries were in the middle of a long strategic competition. “But we are not going to be close friends – and I hope we won’t be outright enemies for many decades to come.”

The effectiveness and wisdom of intervening in other people’s conflicts by proxy, however vital the principle and however seemingly justified the cause, are open to serious question, as much of cold war-era history suggests.    Mere mention of the word “resistance” conjures up, in some British minds at least, images of gallant bicyclists in berets, night-time airstrips lit by torches, and furtive wireless operators valiantly plotting to thwart the “Boche”. The recent film Munich: the Edge of War, in which “good” Germans conspire against “bad” ones, is a reminder that things are usually more complicated. Resistance has many faces.    Tentative plans under discussion in Washington and London to supply weapons and other military equipment to Ukrainians who object to Kremlin-enforced regime change presuppose that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, will launch the long-anticipated invasion and succeed in overthrowing Kyiv’s elected government. Neither eventuality is a given. Putin may continue indefinitely to mess with western heads. An invasion could be repelled.    Yet since Joe Biden, the US president, and Boris Johnson, his little trumpet boy, seem convinced the worst will happen – the “biggest war in Europe since 1945”, in the British prime minister’s melodramatic words – it’s only logical to assume the secret talks about post-invasion strategies acquired a new urgency. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, reportedly briefed Congress last week on plans to deliver additional lethal aid to Ukrainians.    In truth, it’s not even a big secret. “In discussions with allies, senior Biden officials have made clear that the CIA (covertly) and the Pentagon (overtly) would both seek to help any Ukrainian insurgency,” the New York Times reported last month. Asked recently whether Britain would arm resistance fighters, Johnson replied: “It’s possible, I don’t want to rule this out.”    Most public opinion undoubtedly sympathises with the Ukrainian citizens contemplating the destruction of their country’s independence and democracy at the point of a gun. Understandably, many people’s gut instinct would be to resist by all means possible. All the same, officially encouraging what could quickly turn into an extremely violent, long-running, possibly unwinnable struggle requires careful, calm consideration.    It’s easy to agitate for a fight when someone else is doing the fighting and when it’s happening a long way away. There’s a moral issue here: if you yourself decline to bloody your hands, should you really be egging on others to do so? If that does not give pause, then think about the practical implications.    By helping Ukrainian guerrillas or freedom fighters or people’s militias (the terminology alone is problematic) to kill Russian soldiers, the US and Britain would, in effect, be waging a proxy war against Russia. Russia would know this. Would it passively accept it? Or would it return fire in similarly unpleasant, asymmetrical and hybrid ways? Of course it would. Has Johnson thought about that?  Then again, western powers are pretty hopeless at fighting proxy wars via resistance groups. Think of Ronald Reagan’s disastrous Contra war in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Think of the Cuban Bay of Pigs, or how Iraq’s Shias and Kurds were urged to revolt in 1991 by George HW Bush and subsequently betrayed. Saddam Hussein slaughtered them by the thousand. Western politicians, prating about principle then as now, utterly failed them.    Resistance groups can be hard to control. They travel unexpected paths. The most notorious example is Afghanistan, where some US-armed mujahideen groups fighting the post-1979 Soviet occupation went on to create the Taliban, who turned on their creators like Mary Shelley’s monster. Perhaps Johnson, unlike the former Texas congressman Charlie Wilson, who was behind the US covert mission, knows what he’s doing. Or is he, in familiar style, already making promises to Ukrainians he cannot and will not keep?    Proxy wars often do more harm than good, and western powers are not their only proponents. Consider the misery inflicted upon Yemen’s desperate people by the proxy fight between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. History is littered with examples of countries where liberators, in overthrowing oppression, became oppressors. Look at Iran, look at Angola.    The contrary argument, of course, is that each case is different. Ukraine is different. And so it is, at present. But a western-backed insurgency there could easily morph into civil war, spread to the neighbouring Baltic republics and elsewhere, and become in time a head-on, undisguised, unlimited confrontation with Russia. It’s easy to see Johnson starting such a fight. Knowing him as we do, it’s hard to see him finishing it.  Ukraine needs all the support it can get at this moment of enormous, looming trauma. But the best way to help – if it is generally agreed that is the right thing to do – is not to start a potentially endless dirty war of assassinations, bombings, midnight terror, disappearances, bottomless abuses, broken families and broken hearts.    If Johnson and Biden truly want to make a difference – and ensure Putin backs off – they should assume the risk themselves, by offering full Nato membership to Ukraine’s government while it still has one. Don’t send out young Ukrainians to fight and die for democracy and freedom while you sit at home, declaring how terrible it all is.    Stand up for what you say you believe, or pipe down.

The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion.  They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership.  In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed.  Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend.  Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border.  It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000.  For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack  Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far?  Putin: pursuing an old Soviet glory? Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Vladimir Putin  The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded.  A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema.  Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy.  Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia.  More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep.  Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas.  At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word.  Joe Biden: a message to China as well as to Russia. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  Joe Biden  The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster.  Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state.  Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan.  Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move.  Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.  Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution.  Zelenskiy: under pressure to go slowly on Nato membership. Photograph: Reuters  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine’s president impressed world leaders in the Munich security conference this weekend with a brave and punchy speech after ignoring warnings to stay at home for fear of a Russian-inspired coup attempt. His response to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put.  One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides.  Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s.  True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force.  Scholz and Macron: soft line and hard line? Photograph: Getty Images  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz  Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises.  These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war.  Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front.  While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions.  Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights.  That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach.  The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far.  Johnson (right, with Zelenskiy): errand boy for America? Photograph: Getty Images  Boris Johnson  Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it.  At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally.  The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid.  But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff.  Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London.  All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America.  When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.

Putin has said he will not immediately recognise the so-called republics but he is likely to wield that option as a bargaining chip as he continues to demand security guarantees from the west.  The stage-managed manoeuvre unfolded on Tuesday as Putin also confirmed a “partial” withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border, a decision that would reduce the potential for a war if it involves a large number of troops. It is not yet clear that it will.  Since 2014, Russia has used the deadly Donbas conflict to divert attention from its annexation of Crimea and as part of its strategy to maintain control over Ukraine’s geopolitical future.  The Minsk ceasefire deal signed in 2015 formalised a plan to reinsert the Donbas territories into Ukraine but give them a veto over Kyiv’s foreign policy choices, including potential accession to Nato.  But the deal has stalled over ceasefire violations, disagreements about what steps to take first, and a growing belief in Ukraine that the deal was signed at gunpoint and is no longer politically viable.  Hawkish officials and prominent figures in Russia such as the head of RT, Margarita Simonyan, have called for recognition of the regions’ independence. But that is far from a popular sentiment and would remove a key element of the Kremlin’s leverage over Ukraine by killing the Minsk deal.  “The recognition of the LPR and DPR [Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics] by Russia would signify its intentional withdrawal from the Minsk agreements,” a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.  Moscow has already made it difficult to reintegrate the territories by issuing hundreds of thousands of Russian passports there and arming and backing their governments since 2014.  Still, a formal recognition of independence would be seen as a considerable escalation. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said recognition would be a “blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty”. And some European officials have said it would trigger sanctions packages put together to deter a Russian invasion.  “The call of Russia’s State Duma to recognise the occupied territories of Ukraine is an open escalation,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Approval by Kremlin should be met with swift and decisive sanctions.”  The decision may give Putin a way to save face from the crisis, after trying and so far failing to achieve guarantees that Nato will not admit Ukraine and will remove its infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997.  Rather than starting a war, he could kick out the legs from under the ceasefire settlement and move troops into Donbas or even provoke a Ukrainian attack, giving Russia a casus belli.  While Putin argued in his remarks that his deputies were “following public opinion”, it is clear that the Duma vote on Tuesday was largely managed by the Kremlin. As Putin noted, the decision for a partial withdrawal from the borders was directly tied to the vote on recognising the republics. One form of pressure on Ukraine was being swapped for another.  At an impasse in negotiations with the west, Putin is threatening to demolish the status quo. It may mean Russia is considering other options besides war to achieve its goals, but it also signals the Kremlin is growing impatient.  “Russia hears that Ukraine is not prepared to join Nato today, and we know this premise,” Putin said after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “And they say right away that it won’t be admitted tomorrow, but will be admitted when they prepare it for this. But this might be too late for us. Therefore, we want this issue to be settled now, right now, in the near future, through a negotiating process, by peaceful means.”

Following years of financial losses one of the handful of remaining coal-fired power plants in the state appeared doomed, its likely fate offering a small but noteworthy victory in the effort to avoid disastrous climate change. But then a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it.  The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “We were just waiting for this thing to die,” said Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “They were struggling and looking to close. It was on the brink. And then this cryptocurrency company came along.”  In a deal struck in late 2020, Marathon, a bitcoin “mining” company, became the sole recipient of the power station’s electricity. It established an elongated data center on 20 acres of land beside the facility that is packed with more than 30,000 Antminer S19 units, a specialized computer that mines for bitcoin. Such thirst for power is common in crypto – globally bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway, a country of 5.3 million people.  As the bitcoin miners moved in last year, Hardin roared back to life. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, the plant’s boilers fired up on 236 separate days. Planet-heating emissions from the burning of Hardin’s coal soared too, with 187,000 tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the second quarter of last year, more than 5000% more than was expelled in the same period in 2020.  In the third quarter, a further 206,000 tons of CO2 was emitted, a 905% increase on 2020, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows. Hardin was operating at “near full capacity”, Marathon said in a December update, with the data center producing around 34 bitcoin on 1 December.  “I was horrified to see it all happen, it was a terrible turn of events,” said Hedges, who took to visiting the plant and photographing the new data center as it took shape, fans perched on its roof to help cool the humming computer hardware. “This isn’t helping old ladies from freezing to death, it’s to enrich a few people while destroying our climate for all of us. If you’re concerned about climate change you should have nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it’s a disaster for the climate.”  Hardin is part of a wave of America’s “zombie” fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations. China, formerly the epicenter of the bitcoin industry, effectively banished around half of the world’s currency miners last year and the resulting search for cheap power has seen companies eye struggling US power stations.  In 2020, a mothballed coal plant in upstate New York was converted to run on gas and power a large-scale bitcoin mining operation, a move that owner Greenidge Generation said is “bringing a piece of the world’s digital future” to the state. Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor who said he would accept his first paycheck in bitcoin, last week criticised the environmental impact of crypto mining.  Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close before pivoting to bitcoin. And in Kentucky, a new bitcoin facility is being built next to the Big Rivers Electric Corporation, which owns and operates four coal-fired power plants.

Photograph: Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images  This tactic, crypto firms argue, generates local jobs – Kentucky aimed to lure currency miners by passing a law that exempts them from an electricity sales tax – and uses up excess power without straining the grid for homes and businesses. But critics point out that the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US.  “Coal and natural gas power plants used for crypto mining that would otherwise be sunsetting as we decarbonize adds yet more carbon to the atmosphere in an era when we should be cutting such emissions,” said Benjamin Jones, a specialist in natural resource economics at the University of New Mexico. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.”  Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm.  Even some early champions of bitcoin have balked at its energy use, with Elon Musk last year halting Tesla’s use of the crypto currency because, he said, the electric vehicle company is “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Uber, the ride-hailing service, has said it won’t accept crypto payments until the climate impacts are reduced.  Entrance of the Hardin plant. Photograph: Courtesy of Anne Hedges  A little more than a decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoins with a single computer at home, using a negligible amount of electricity. The ultimate supply of bitcoins was limited and new bitcoins were awarded to those who could help validate transactions – the miners.  The process of validation essentially involves playing a giant guessing game that gets more difficult the more miners participate. As interest in bitcoin has soared, fast, powerful computers, packed in warehouses, now have a better chance of winning the guessing game and being rewarded with several bitcoins, which are currently worth around $42,000 each.  This race for bitcoin wealth gobbles up an enormous amount of electricity – around 0.5% of total global consumption. The energy used to mine bitcoin every 60 seconds would be enough to power the average American household for 17 years, while the annual electricity consumption for mining would be able to power all kettles used to boil water for tea in the UK for 28 years.  While this usage has been criticized by climate activists, bitcoin miners claim it should be put in a different context. Fred Thiel, chief executive of Marathon, said that the movement of physical goods around the world, and even the use of washing machines in the US, uses more energy than bitcoin. “I understand the desire for some people to point bitcoin mining as the big bad boy, but on a comparison with every other industry out there, it’s insignificant,” he said in an interview.  Thiel likens bitcoin mining to the transactions processed in data centers by companies such as Amazon and Google and claimed that the industry is moving quickly towards renewable energy – Marathon plans to phase out its use of coal next year – after finding its options were limited when miners had to quickly shift away from China.  “Go back to 2020, renewable companies weren’t offering energy to bitcoin miners,” said Thiel. “Very few people wanted to even deal with bitcoin miners in the energy world. And so bitcoin miners spent time looking for stranded assets. And so the only way for us to mine was to find stranded energy, which we did in finding the Hardin plant.”  It remains to be seen if bitcoin will make a significant move away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime it will likely come under increasing scrutiny over its appetite for fossil fuel-powered electricity. “We simply don’t know how emissions from bitcoin mining will look in five to 10 years,” said Jones, the University of New Mexico professor. “It seems likely, though, it will to continue to be a major consumer of energy going forward.”

Republicans in several states have launched efforts to ban books pertaining to race and LGBTQ+ issues from classrooms, while some legislatures are pushing to introduce laws which would ban teachers from discussing homosexuality. Other states have already banned discussion of the modern-day impact of historic racism in the US.  It is a situation that has no parallel in America’s recent history. And in an interview with the Guardian, Stephanie Nossel, CEO of PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, said the efforts to censor education, in particular, fit in with a wider attempt by conservatives to influence society.  “There have been battles and debates that have bubbled up from time to time but the ferocity of this wave of both the education gag orders affecting curricular and book bans is unprecedented,” Nossel said.  “We’re in this pitched moment of historically unprecedented polarization in our country and there is a very potent and intense struggle under way about what the future of our society looks like,” Nossel said.  There are few signs that US polarization will decrease any time soon. Democrats and Republican politicians are deeply divided over issues around education, social care, women’s rights and the pandemic recovery, while only a fifth of Republicans believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected, despite a lack of evidence of widespread election fraud.  In January an NBC News poll found that 70% of Americans believe the country has become so polarized it can no longer solve major issues facing the country.  “Our population is changing. We’re becoming an increasingly pluralistic society, along so many different dimensions and there’s this fierce backlash trying to kind of yank it in the other direction, with the notion that we’re somehow restoring some great path that’s been lost.  “We see that in efforts to curtail voting rights across the country and to empower legislatures to overrule the will of an increasingly diverse population that go to the polls.”  That crusade is increasingly bleeding into education. In the last year, PEN America counted 155 bills introduced in 38 states that would censor what teachers can say or teach in classrooms. In 2022 there has been a “steep rise” in the introduction of what PEN America calls “gag orders”, the organization said.  In Florida a “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which would ban discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, was passed by the state senate’s education committee on 8 February, and has been endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. The bill, which must pass the full Florida senate and the house before becoming law, would allow parents to file lawsuits against school boards if they believe policies violate the law.  A bill introduced in the Kansas house on 9 February would change the state’s obscenity law, making it a class B misdemeanor for a teacher to use any material which depicts “homosexuality” in a classroom, while looming legislation in Arizona would allow parents to sue teachers and school districts for perceived violations of parental rights.  In schools, these laws serve to “hobble our educators, and intimidate them in a chilling way”, Nossel said.  “It puts librarians, teachers, principals in a position of having to fear that if they put forward certain ideas, or even if a student puts forward certain ideas, and it gets taken up as a classroom discussion, that they may be subject to discipline or punishment or fines.”  While classroom censorship has become an eagerly embraced hobbyhorse for conservatives, there is little evidence that a majority of parents are demanding more censorship in the classroom or demanding more influence over what their children can read, or be taught.  A CNN poll in early February found that only 12% of Americans believed parents “should have the most sway over which library books are on the shelves and how American history is taught”.  “I think it’s a manufactured issue, to be honest. There aren’t a lot of parents who are rifling through their child’s backpack in horror to discover, you know, a copy of Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” Nossel said.  “I think there are some activists who have realized that by pointing out, whether it’s profanity or controversial ideas in some of these books, they can activate a sense of frustration that parents do have about a range of issues.”  Those issues include the debate about wearing masks in schools, and mixed emotions about the length of pandemic-era school closures.  But censorship has also been pushed by conservative groups linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors. Groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education have been instrumental in book banning attempts in the US, often presenting themselves as small, “grassroots” efforts, while in reality they have links to prominent, wealthy Republicans.  Existing tensions, Nossel said, have “been used to fuel this ideological debate over books and to fire it up”.  “We used to talk about a pocketbook issue here in the United States, an issue that affects people’s pocketbooks.  “This is an issue that affects the backpack. It affects something that’s in the home, that’s very personal and close to home. And so, I think the organizers and the activists feel like they’ve been able to strike a nerve with this, even though the backdrop of parental concern over what’s being read and taught in schools is relatively low.’  There may be no recent parallel for the scale of the conservative crackdown.  Nossel, whose book Dare to Speak: Defending Free Speech for All, serves as a guide to protecting and promoting free speech, said the clearest similarity to the potential prosecution of teachers is from almost 100 years ago, in the Scopes trial, involving the Tennessee science teacher John Scopes.  In 1925 Scopes was accused of violating Tennessee’s recently passed Butler Act, which made it illegal to teach the theory of evolution in public schools. He was found guilty and fined $100, although the verdict was later overturned. After the trial Mississippi passed a similar law, and in the same year Texas banned evolution theory from school textbooks.  More recent parallels can be found in the policing of books and ideas in the Soviet Union, and Russia introduced a “gay propaganda” law in 2013 which in effect made it illegal to equate straight and gay relationships. China has long banned the book Tombstone, Yang Jishen’s recounting of the Great Chinese Famine, which casts a negative light on the country’s communist rulers.  Nossel said it would be going too far to directly equate the situation in the US to those countries – “We’re a democracy here, and that’s extremely important,” she said – but she warned there is an “echo in the tactics”.  “Those situations, obviously, were far, far more severe. But I think we have to be on guard,” Nossel said.  “A lot of us have been surprised about what we’ve witnessed in this country over the last several years. So we can’t be too sanguine about this just being sort of a phase, and a passing trend.”

The mission, run by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is made up of hundreds of unarmed monitors, often former diplomats from OSCE member states. Their armoured vehicles crisscross the territory on both sides of the lines to report ceasefire violations.  As Moscow looks ready to exploit the tense situation in the conflict zone to provide a pretext for the further invasion of Ukraine, the work of the monitors is more important than ever. However, just when they are most needed, their ability to work has been hampered by the decision by several countries to evacuate, due to the risk of a Russian invasion.  “We have asked for France and Germany to increase the number of monitors they have in place, and we want the OSCE to return to working according to its mandate,” said the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereschuk, speaking on Saturday in Stanytsia Luhanska, a town in Ukrainian-controlled territory right on the frontline.  Russia insists Ukraine is planning an offensive in the east. Ukraine and western countries believe Russian claims of escalation are merely a smokescreen to give it a pretext to launch a military assault.  “It’s very important for everyone to understand that it’s the Russian Federation that’s behind this. Ukraine has no offensive plans,” said Vereschuk, after a visit to a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska that was shelled on Thursday.  Impact marks suggest the kindergarten was hit from the south, where the Russia-backed separatists have positions, but Russian media have suggested the incident could have been a setup.  Although journalists were given access to the scene on Thursday and again on Saturday, in their daily report the OSCE said its staff were not permitted to approach closer than 50 metres to the school and were thus “unable to determine the weapons used or the direction of fire”.  “This did not happen,” said Vereschuk. “Unfortunately, we are able to state that the OSCE special monitoring mission was not completely objective about the situation with the kindergarten.”  Serhiy Haidai, the Kyiv-appointed governor of Luhansk region, went further, suggesting the departure of British, American and Canadian monitors had led to a pro-Russian bias.  “Those who are left are representatives of Russia and the former Soviet countries, and they can look at things very one-sidedly. They don’t go where they know they will find proof of shelling of civilian buildings, but they are very happy to look at our military installations, and this creates a big question for us,” he told the Guardian in Stanytsia Luhanska.  The mission’s 680 monitors come from more than 40 countries, and the withdrawn American, British, Canadian and Dutch delegations represent 57, 40, 28 and seven people respectively, according to a January OSCE report.  The OSCE mission has long come under suspicion on both sides of the lines, though impediments to work on the separatist side have usually been more frequent and greater. “The Ukrainians were always suspicious of the Russian and Belarusian monitors, while the separatists were suspicious of Americans and Poles,” said Nikolaus von Twickel, a Berlin-based analyst who previously worked for the mission.  A spokesperson for the mission did not comment on the Ukrainian accusations, but after this article was published, the Twitter account of the mission posted a message from the chief monitor: “In response to a media item today, I underline that all staff are bound by the mission’s code of conduct – the ethical principles and norms of the OSCE – and perform their duties impartially and neutrally.”  Sources inside the OSCE mission dismissed Ukrainian claims of bias. “The idea that a change in personnel would influence the report … This just isn’t how it works. There are so many layers of checks,” said one source inside the mission, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  However, there is great unease at the decision by some countries to withdraw monitors. In a video call with about 450 staff last Monday, the head of the monitoring mission, Yaşar Halit Çevik, said evacuated staff with office jobs would not be able to work remotely, according to one source who was on the call.  Çevik also said that if monitors from countries that had not ordered evacuations were worried about the situation, they could take annual leave. Many staff have done so, further depleting the mission.  One member of the mission described the OSCE plans for evacuation if there is a Russian escalation as “shaky at best, and still in progress”, which was a factor that led many to opt to take leave.  However, among the monitors stationed in the most dangerous parts of eastern Ukraine there is a feeling that the US, British and Canadian withdrawal is an overreaction. “There is a strong opinion among colleagues that it’s a bad idea,” said one monitor, from a country that has not evacuated its citizens.  “There are colleagues who served in Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq. People knew they were signing up to be sent into a war zone. And now, when the mission is more important than ever before, they are being pulled out.”

New legislation, described as the “toughest ever” by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, gives the UK government powers to freeze the assets of individuals linked to the Russian state in the event of an invasion of Ukraine but fails to “capture” property owned via anonymous offshore structures.  The irritation in EU capitals at the perceived hole in the UK’s sanctions threat has only been exacerbated by Boris Johnson’s repeated calls in recent days for European governments to “wean” themselves off dependency on Russian gas.  “Parading around preaching at your allies is all very well if you have sorted your own house out,” said one diplomatic source. “But they haven’t. You only need to look at the number of empty properties in Kensington and Chelsea to know that.”  Truss had claimed that legislation laid in parliament on 10 February left the oligarchs with “nowhere to hide” as the UK is able to sanction entities and businesses of economic and strategic significance to the Russian government, as well as their owners, directors and trustees.  But EU capitals are concerned by the failure of the government to ensure that the identity of those who own real estate is at hand in the event of sanctions being necessary. According to the NGO Transparency International, more than 85,000 properties in the UK are owned anonymously by entities registered abroad.  The legal loophole in Europe’s punitive package has been the subject of discussions in recent days among diplomats coordinating Europe’s response to Russian aggression.  It is understood these concerns have been conveyed to London. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.  On Sunday, Boris Johnson, speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, conceded that the City of London had a problem with Russian money but claimed that the government would be able to expose the true ownership of property through a register of beneficial ownership.  Johnson told the BBC: “We are making sure that we open up the Russian doll of property ownership, of company ownership, in London and see who’s behind everything. And we’ve got to do it and we’ve got to hit very hard.”  But such a database is yet to be established despite promises made by the government since 2016. Plans for an economic crime bill had been included in the 2019 Queen’s speech but the legislation is yet to materialise.  Johnson conceded that the sanctions package “may not be enough on its own”, adding “it will be very damaging and very difficult” but “it may not be enough to deter an irrational actor”.  The west has sought to show a united front on the sanctions that would be imposed on Russia if Vladimir Putin does wage war in Ukraine, with warnings from the US, the EU and the UK of “severe costs and massive consequences”.  On Sunday, the European council president, Charles Michel, told the Munich security conference: “One thing is certain: if there is further military aggression, we will react with massive sanctions.”  The UK has for a long time been a favoured hiding place for Russian oligarchs seeking to protect their wealth. Transparency International published a report last week that identified £1.5bn-worth of property owned by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin.  A report by the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee in 2018 concluded: “London’s role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlin-connected corruption risks signalling that the UK is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Putin’s offensive measures.”

He is courteous and friendly, but without ever quite shaking off the impression he would rather be almost anywhere else. It’s just before Christmas, and the rampant Omicron variant of Covid-19 has put paid to in-person meetings. You don’t get the impression Murphy minds too much. At a Zoom’s remove, he sits back in his chair, hair restored to luxuriant cruising length after the savage chop required for Peaky Blinders. His storied peepers – organs that have inspired countless column inches and exhaustive maritime imagery – are, for once, hard to discern.  I recognise the spare white wall behind him, which is decorated with a poster for the band Grizzly Bear and a painting. This must be his famous basement. In the Dublin home he shares with his wife, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist, and their teenage sons Malachy and Aran, the basement is Murphy’s fortress of solitude. He has spent a lot of time here over lockdown, noodling around on guitars, scrolling the news about the pandemic and recording impressively eclectic radio programmes for BBC 6 Music.  Playing a blinder: Cillian Murphy as mob boss Tommy Shelby. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions  “How do you recognise that?” he asks, with the haha-but-seriously-how-do-you-know? tone of a man wondering if he needs more security.  “I think you did Jimmy Kimmel from it,” I say.  “Oh yes that’s right,” he says, relaxing, just slightly, with a chuckle. “I’d forgotten. Every man needs a cave, and this is mine.”  Murphy, 45 but with the career of an actor twice that age, has always been a nightmare for dirt-dishing hacks. He does not fall out of nightclubs. He does not have a torrid personal life, or at least not one that has been made public. He is not given to bashing his colleagues or trenchant political statements. “Cillian’s not silly,” says the actor Sam Neill, his co-star in the first two series of Peaky. “He does not splash his life around. He does not turn up to set shredded. He is extremely diligent and extremely good at what he does.”  “I love getting up and being someone else,” Murphy says. “What I find hard is getting up and being hilarious or entertaining as myself. That was never in the job description and I’m not very good at it. But it’s an unwritten part of the gig. You do the work and then you have to go out and perform as yourself. I find it terrifying, because I’m not a personality, you know?”  Last man standing: Cillian Murphy in 28 days Later from 2002. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy  He says the 6 Music programmes have been satisfying to do because it’s just about the tunes – Masayoshi Fujita to Al Green to T Rex – without any element of revelation. “I couldn’t do live radio – I’d find that absolutely terrifying,” he says. “I like just sitting down here in the dark, coming up with the playlists.” To listen to him, you would think he sits at home all the time, making the odd furtive expedition to Tesco.  “I really don’t go out much,” he says, “And people are so underwhelmed when they encounter me, so I’m very happy with that. And I’m always happy to chat. What I don’t like is people surreptitiously taking photographs, which someone said is like the amateur Stasi. It’s so fucking weird. I’ve been sat on the tube and people have started filming me. I don’t want to be like, ‘poor fucking celebrities’, that is not what I’m trying to say. I’m very happy and privileged and all of that. But I think this thing of having cameras everywhere is something we need to sort out.” He laughs again. “Or maybe I’m just old.”  Sadly sometimes there is no getting around a bit of press. After nine years and 30 episodes, the final series of Peaky Blinders is about to air on BBC One. There are plans for a one-off feature film, but as far as telly is concerned, this is it. The drama has become a phenomenon, with millions of viewers around the world, thanks partly to it being picked up by Netflix. The Peaky Blinders look – three-piece suits, haircuts that are long on top and shaved at the back and sides – are imitated at racecourses around the country. And the series has been built around Murphy’s performance as the gang leader, Tommy Shelby.  The origin legend of Peaky Blinders is that when Steven Knight, the creator, was deciding who to cast as the lead, he got a text from Murphy: “Remember, I’m an actor.” The Irishman was one of two men under consideration. The other was Jason Statham. It would be a surprise if they often found themselves up against each other for work. Statham is a former Guy Ritchie stalwart turned blockbuster beefcake.  Hidden depths: in a scene from A Quiet Place: Part II (2020). Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy  Murphy, or at least as we thought of him then, was intense in a more cerebral way, a slightly otherworldly figure. He had broken through playing a troubled teen in Enda Walsh’s Disco Pigs, first in the stage version and then in the film adaptation. But he was best known for his work with the directors Christopher Nolan and Danny Boyle. Often he played scientists: the psychotic villain Scarecrow in Nolan’s Batman films, a physicist in the sci-fi thriller Sunshine; the beleaguered Jim in 28 Days Later, who wakes up in a post-pandemic London. Murphy was a subtle and charismatic actor, but he was not the first name that came to mind for a murderous Brummie gang leader with PTSD.  “Nothing really set Cillian up as the obvious choice,” Knight says. “But we knew he was interested, so we met him.” Some have cruelly suggested that Murphy’s text might have been a concealed dig at Statham, but Knight says not. “What [Murphy] meant by the text was that when he walks into a room, he’s not Tommy Shelby. But he can become him. He inhabits that role completely. It’s phenomenal. It is impossible to imagine anybody else playing him.”  “He’s very, very private,” he adds. “As a friend he’s open, he’s affable, he’s a real laugh. And I think if you’re in the spotlight you have to have two personalities. One is for when you’re being observed, and one is for when you’re just a normal bloke, which is what he is.”  Peaky did not look like a hit from the start. Set during the interwar years, it is a kind of mythic British Western, which fictionalises a real-life Birmingham criminal gang. In Knight’s vision, the Blinders are run by Tommy Shelby, a decorated First World War hero, and his brothers Arthur and John. They make their money through extortion, gambling and racketeering. As the Blinders’ influence has grown, the series has incorporated such real-life events as the Russian revolution, American prohibition and the gang wars of the UK after the 1920s. The series is built around Murphy’s performance, to the extent that Joe Cole, who played John, said he quit partly because it was “Cillian’s show, really”. Tommy is an enigma and a contradiction; a damaged man who does bad things to protect the people he loves.  ‘Her death was unbelievably sad and difficult’: with the late Helen McCrory, his co-star in Peaky Blinders. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy  “The beauty of the character is that he says one thing, but he’s got empathy in his eyes,” says Annabelle Wallis, who plays Tommy’s wife, Grace. “You cannot look away from them. He’s got that Irish colouring: the dark hair and the light eyes. I think what divides great actors and good actors are the eyes. I believe on a subconscious level that’s why the audience continues to love the character despite all the terrible things he does.”  For Murphy, the finale means mixed emotions. He is meticulous about preparation. “I do all the work before I arrive on set,” he says. “But that method thing doesn’t really make sense to me. It’s about a series of little decisions and processes, which hopefully add up to the performance you want. ” On the one hand, no more Peaky means no more of the “fucking exhausting” work to become Tommy, the immaculate Birmingham accent and the gym sessions and protein and, by his estimation, 3,000 fake herbal cigarettes per series. But it’s also the end of an enduring part that has lodged itself in the British firmament. Audiences don’t merely like Peaky Blinders, they love it: for its strangeness, its swagger, its evocation of the tricky interwar period in British history through the prism of a city, Birmingham, which is often overlooked.  “It feels like the end of something,” Murphy says. “It’s strange talking about it. I don’t have a grasp on it yet. Maybe when it’s done I’ll have some perspective. It’s the end of 10 years of my life; a big adventure with lots of colleagues and people that you became very close to.”  Among the people Murphy became closest to was his co-star Helen McCrory, who played the Shelby brothers’ beloved aunt Polly. McCrory died of cancer last April, at 52, before Covid-delayed filming began on the final series. Polly is the closest the gang have to a matriarch, unafraid to speak her mind and often serving as their moral conscience. In a remembrance of her he wrote for the Observer in December, he said she was his “closest pal” on set.  ‘People are so underwhelmed when they encounter me, so I’m very happy with that’: Cillian Murphy. Photograph: Simon Watson/The Observer  “Her death was unbelievably sad and difficult,” he says. “But I’m always careful when I talk about it. I’m a friend and a colleague, but then you think about Damian [Lewis, McCrory’s husband] and their kids. I don’t own that grief, you know? But she was a remarkable human being and a remarkable actor. It was very hard to make it without her.”  He also admired the way she balanced her home life with the demands of the job. “I think she and Damian handled them both being very successful actors, living in the public eye, beautifully,” he says. “The way she was able to interact with fans and be a mum and do the work. It was really elegant. I find it much more tricky; I overthink things.”  The irony of being so private about his life outside the work, in an era when some broadcast every hour the lord sends on social media, is that it makes fans even more desperate for intelligence. “I think being so private is what keeps his mystique and allure,” says Wallis. “It’s a dying trait in our culture, so when you have an actor who’s continually mysterious and evading the limelight, it creates a thirst for that person.”  Murphy will have to handle the limelight for a while longer. Christopher Nolan has cast him as the lead in Oppenheimer, his upcoming biopic about Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. It will be their sixth film together, after the three Batman films, Inception and Dunkirk. Those worried about the dumbing down of popular culture may be reassured that one of the world’s leading directors is spending $100m on a blockbuster about a physicist.  “I’ll always turn up for Chris, whatever the size of the part,” Murphy says. “Chris will call me up and I’m there. Isn’t it wonderful that filmmakers are still making challenging, demanding films within the studio system, shot on film rather than Imax? I think he’s flying the flag. Him, Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino, are fantastic filmmakers making interesting work on a massive scale.”  The film is based on American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer, Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography. Murphy says he is preparing by doing “an awful lot of reading. I’m interested in the man and what [inventing the atomic bomb] does to the individual. The mechanics of it, that’s not really for me – I don’t have the intellectual capability to understand them, but these contradictory characters are fascinating. Tommy Shelby’s a complete contradiction, too. People identify with that, because we all walk around with these contradictory ideas coexisting in our heads.”  Reading was Murphy’s first love. He grew up in Cork, where his mother taught English and French, and his father worked for the department of education. He went to the elite Presentation Brothers College, where he steeped himself in fiction before succumbing, temporarily, to the lure of rock stardom. The band he started with his younger brother, Paidi, the Sons of Mr Green Genes, was on the verge of signing a record deal but decided against it. An abortive attempt at a law degree followed, before Walsh cast him in Disco Pigs in 1996, when Murphy was 20.  ‘We cook, we watch movies, we listen to music’: Cillian Murphy on life at home. Photograph: Simon Watson/The Observer  “We did pretty well, but I’m happy it didn’t work out,” he says of the music career. “I don’t think I’d have stayed friends with the guys in the band and I still am good friends with them. All bands fall out. Unless you’re Coldplay, you get signed, used up and spat out. At least as an actor you can make decisions on your own. That five-person dynamic in a band is traumatic.”  Over the past couple of years he has starting making music again, but only for personal interest. “I’m too hypercritical. It’s all shite. Never, ever for public consumption. But it was a good exercise. It’s healthy for the soul to let it out on something like that.”  There is one area where Murphy has used his platform to help agitate for change, as a spokesperson for a scheme pioneered by the Unesco Child and Family Research Centre at NUI Galway, to get empathy taught in schools. They recently had a breakthrough, with a number of schools deciding to trial it. “There’s data that shows how beneficial it is for kids, not only for their empathy but also academically,” he says. “Raising boys, it seems very practical and sensible that you would promote empathy. It’s about listening, and the best acting is about listening, too. If you’re listening to someone, you can respond emotionally to them. Social media is not an empathic form. As [the writer] George Saunders says, we’re not our best selves on there. It’s very gladiatorial. But we’re stuck with it.”  Murphy’s lockdown sounds like it has been stubbornly normal. His sons are old enough to have knuckled down to their homework without Tommy Shelby-esque motivational talks (Aran has shown signs of following his old man into the trade, appearing in a stage play of Hamnet, about Shakespeare’s only son.)  “We cook, we watch movies, we listen to music,” Murphy says, laughing at the attempt to skirt back into his personal life. “I was vegetarian for a long time then I relapsed and now I’ve relapsed back to vegetarianism. My wife is, too. It’s so unremarkable! It’s not good copy.”  In other words: remember, he’s an actor.

Hello, Warren Murray here to open the week in news.  A massive leak from one of the world’s biggest private banks, Credit Suisse, has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. Details of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients all over the world are contained in the leak, which unmasks the beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn)* held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions. The leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by Credit Suisse, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data.  We can reveal how Credit Suisse repeatedly either opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world. They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend, and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine. One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal.  The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients. “Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct”. The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the past decade, and a portion remain open today.

Biden, Putin may meet – Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin have agreed in principle to attend a summit aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis, France’s presidency has announced. It follows weekend diplomatic efforts by Emmanuel Macron to avert a Russian invasion. The Élysée Palace said the summit “can only be held if Russia does not invade Ukraine”. The White House said Biden had accepted in principle, although “currently Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon”. Biden convened a rare Sunday meeting of his national security council. Moscow has rescinded its undertaking to end military exercises in Belarus which were due to conclude on Sunday. The Belarus defence ministry said Russian troops would stay indefinitely. We are of course live-blogging all the developments.  End of Covid restrictions – Cabinet will meet today to rubber-stamp the lifting of all remaining Covid restrictions in England. Changes are expected to include ending the legal requirement to isolate if you have Covid; ending universal free PCR and lateral flow tests; ending the national contact tracing service; and ending twice-weekly tests for schoolchildren. Boris Johnson told the BBC that coronavirus “remains a dangerous disease” for vulnerable and unvaccinated people, but it was time “to see our country really getting back on its feet”. Separately, Priti Patel has agreed to ban anti-vaxxers from “harmful and disruptive” protests outside schools and vaccination clinics. Buckingham Palace said the Queen, 95, had experienced “mild cold-like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid but was due to continue with light duties this week. And Australia has finally reopened its international borders.  SBTV founder dies – Jamal Edwards, who set up the media platform SBTV, which helped catapult grime and new artists like Ed Sheeran, Dave and Jessie J to global fame, died on Sunday morning aged 31. Edwards said he started SBTV “on a £20 phone” while he was still at school and grew it into a leading online youth broadcaster. Edwards was born in Luton in 1990 and grew up in Acton, west London.  Jamal Edwards set up SBTV, a hugely influential media platform for emerging music. Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images  He received a BTec diploma in media moving image from Ealing College and worked at retail chain Topman to financially support himself while developing SBTV. A director, author, DJ, entrepreneur and designer, he was awarded an MBE in 2014 – when he was 24 – for his work in music. He was an ambassador for the Prince of Wales’s charity, the Prince’s Trust, and undertook extensive philanthropic work, including in mental health and the funding of youth centres.  Ottawa freed of convoy – Canadian police have fenced off the Ottawa city centre after evicting the “Freedom Convoy” led by truck drivers opposed to a vaccine mandate. Seventy-six vehicles had been towed, police said on Sunday, and with the end of the three-week occupation came 191 arrests and the prospect of more. Demonstrators had used hundreds of trucks and vehicles to block the city centre since 28 January.  01:20 Ottawa trucker protest: pepper spray and scuffles as police try to clear capital – video  On the weekend police used pepper spray and stun grenades to clear most of the area in front of Canada’s federal parliament. Protesters who were filmed by police and had left the city would be held to account, said Ottawa’s interim police chief, Steve Bell. “We will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges.” Canada’s parliament is due on Monday to vote on whether to keep in force emergency powers invoked by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau.  House prices spiral up – First-time buyers are expected to lose out again in the race to buy the few properties on the market. Asking prices for homes newly listed in Britain rose by a record 2.3% in February, according to the property website Rightmove. The site said it was the biggest monthly increase in the 20 years it has kept records – the average advertised cost of a home was up by £7,785, to £348,804. The number of new property listings increased by 11% during the month, but the number of people looking to buy a property rose by 16%. Rightmove’s figures say average asking prices have risen by nearly £40,000 in the two years since the pandemic started, compared with £9,000 in the previous two years.  Today in Focus podcast: Credit Suisse, a bank for dictators, drug lords and criminals  A leak of data from Credit Suisse has shown how it provided services to known criminals and fraudsters for decades. It’s the latest huge scandal to hit the Swiss bank, say investigative reporters Kalyeena Makortoff and David Pegg.

Charlie Brooker: ‘Mr Dystopia? That makes me sound like a wrestler.’ Photograph: Michael Wharley  Sport  Rory McIlroy has taken aim at Phil Mickelson after the latter’s extraordinary sentiment relating to a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf tour. Upon completion of his final round at the Genesis Invitational on Sunday, McIlroy branded Mickelson’s words “naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant”. The Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick, condemned the unsavoury scenes that led to Anthony Elanga being struck by a coin from the Leeds United stand during a fiery contest at Elland Road on Sunday, with the hosts investigating the incident.  Dreaming is for free, as someone round these parts once said, and Daniel Podence’s second-half winner means Wolves are now two points behind fifth place in the Premier League with two games in hand and both Arsenal and West Ham, the two teams immediately above them, to play away this coming week. The former England midfielder Jack Wilshere has joined Danish club Aarhus. There may have been some raised eyebrows at the Lionesses’ unusual starting XI to play Spain but a gutsy and focused performance against a team laden with Barcelona’s Champions League winners earned a 0-0 draw and demonstrated there is serious depth to England’s squad looking ahead to the European Championship this summer. If there is one man England’s rugby team are keen to see back fit and singing the anthems at Twickenham, it is Manu Tuilagi.  Business  Asian shares have mostly been lower after a retreat on Wall Street. Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai declined while Sydney advanced. At time of writing, futures trading suggests the FTSE will open higher while the pound is worth $1.362 and €1.198.  The papers  The Guardian’s joint Credit Suisse investigation is promoted heavily on page one today. Also on the front: “Last-ditch talks as fears of Ukraine war intensify”. The Queen’s Covid diagnosis is on the front too, and in the conservative press it’s big news that ties in well with the clamoured-for end of England’s coronavirus restrictions. “Queen’s Covid example to us all”, says the Daily Mail. The Telegraph has “Queen vows to carry on working with Covid”.  The Guardian’s front page, Monday 21 February 2022  “Queen catches Covid in castle outbreak”, says the Express. The Mirror has “Queen gets Covid but she carries on” and the Metro’s headline is similar: “One keeps calm and carries on”. The Sun puts a foot wrong with “HRH to WFH” – the correct royal style is HM, for Her Majesty. The Times leads with “PM’s ‘pride’ as all restrictions lifted” while the Queen’s diagnosis is an inset panel to that story. In the i they have “Queen still at work with Covid”. The situation on the Ukraine-Russia border is also on fronts of course, and it is the lead in the Financial Times: “Belarus says Russian troops will stay as west seeks Ukraine talks”.

The information passed to Mr. Biden from the intelligence agencies left unclear whether Mr. Putin’s orders would lead to a massive invasion or a more gradual approach that would give the Russian leader more opportunities to exploit fissures just beneath the surface in the Western alliance arrayed against him. He could, for example, test the proposition that Germany or Italy, the two Western European countries most dependent on Russian-provided gas, might falter in their resolve.  Those were the scenarios being discussed most intensely this weekend at the Munich Security Conference, the annual meeting of government ministers, corporate leaders and strategists, where attendees gamed out Mr. Putin’s choices.  “If he is intent on escalating, I don’t think it’s a sudden blitzkrieg to Kyiv and the ouster of the Zelensky government,” said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical consulting firm. “It’s much more likely to look like a recognition of the independence of the breakaway territory” around Luhansk, in the east.  “You hope, if you are Putin, that leads to more skittishness of some of the NATO allies, less alignment with NATO, more opportunities for Russia to get what it wants without having to go full-scale into Ukraine,” Mr. Bremmer said.  A few weeks ago, some American officials shared that sentiment. Mr. Putin, they noted, presumably wanted to achieve his goal — a halt to Ukraine’s drift toward the West — as cheaply and with as few casualties as possible. All he sought was a friendly, pliable government like the one he has in Belarus, said one senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing diplomatic efforts. The president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has tied the security of his country to the presence of the Russian military. (“They will be here as long as necessary,” said Mr. Lukashenko, who is considering inviting Russia to place its nuclear weapons back on Belarusian territory.)

A stray shell, for example, might hit a residential building, or there could be a terrorist attack on fleeing refugees. Whatever the situation, Ukraine would be blamed, and Russia would have a pretext to invade.  Russia, despite repeated accusations from the West, says that it has no intention of invading, and that it simply wants its legitimate geopolitical interests respected.  On Sunday evening, the Ukrainian military issued a statement saying the Russian-backed separatists in the Luhansk region had opened fire with heavy artillery on their own capital city “with the goal of blaming the Ukrainian military.”  “In the absence of any aggressive action from the Ukrainian defenders, the occupiers themselves are blowing up infrastructure in the occupied territories and firing chaotically on towns,” the statement said. Russian news agencies reported artillery strikes in the area. There were no immediate reports of casualties.  While attacking one’s own side to blame an enemy may seem particularly sinister, it would not be the first time it has happened over the eight-year history of the two enclaves.  Analysts have suspected numerous violent events to be false-flag attacks. And insider violence by Russia’s security services or local proxies has been an integral aspect of the republics’ history for years, according to the Ukrainian intelligence services and public statements by comrades of some of those killed.  In recent days, both sides along the eastern Ukrainian front have been making ominous predictions about a mass-casualty event somewhere out in the mining and farming villages — and they are blaming each other even before it has happened.

Putin chairing a meeting with members of the Security Council via a video link last week in Moscow. Credit... Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik, via Reuters  MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will hold an unscheduled meeting of his Security Council on Monday, the Kremlin said, declaring that “tensions are rising” as the warnings from the United States that his nation stands poised to attack Ukraine, swiftly and without provocation, grow more dire by the day.  Mr. Putin held a second call with President Emmanuel Macron of France at 1 a.m. Moscow time on Monday morning, after speaking with the French leader on Sunday, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters.  Mr. Macron proposed a summit between President Biden and Mr. Putin, the French presidency said, but Mr. Peskov did not confirm that preparations for such a meeting had begun.  “It’s clear that tensions are rising,” Mr. Peskov said. “It’s too early to talk about concrete plans for organizing any summits.”  At Monday’s extraordinary meeting of the Security Council, Mr. Putin would deliver a speech, Mr. Peskov said. He did not specify what the speech would be about.  The meeting would come a day after the latest round of high-stakes diplomacy by Mr. Macron, which had appeared to give some new hope for a peaceful resolution over Ukraine as White House officials said Mr. Biden would be willing to consider direct talks with his Russian counterpart as long as Russia did not invade.  While not confirming plans for a summit, Mr. Peskov noted that Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov was planning to meet with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken this week, and that he may speak to his French counterpart as well.  White House officials said a possible summit between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin would only be held after meetings between the top diplomats of the two countries, which are tentatively scheduled for later this week  One senior White House official said there were no plans for either the format or timing of a meeting between the two leaders. Another official called it all completely notional, and said that all evidence suggests Russia still intends to invade Ukraine in the coming days. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  In a statement from the White House, Jen Psaki, the press secretary, said that Mr. Biden had accepted the idea of talks with Mr. Putin “in principle” and said that the United States remains committed to pursuing diplomacy “until the moment an invasion begins.”  “We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,” she wrote in the statement. “And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.”  Mr. Putin said last week that Ukrainian forces were carrying out a “genocide” of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, a false claim that Western officials see as an attempt to build a case for a military intervention. Russian state television aired unfounded claims that Ukraine was preparing an offensive against the Russian-backed separatist territories in the country’s east, and showed residents fleeing to Russia, noting that “children are especially suffering.”  “Everything is very serious,” the state television host Dmitri Kiselyov said on his weekly news show Sunday evening. “Ukraine is literally being dragged into war with Russia.”

Appeasement. Result? At least the annexation of Crimea and aggression against my state.”  The mood at the conference — the Davos of foreign affairs, a venue of often bracing conflict — was subdued, almost disembodied, marked by stunned nervousness over the possibility of a European war, diminished by harsh Covid-19 restrictions and missing the Russian participation that has often stirred vigorous debate.  The Russian no-show felt ominous, a symbol of a Europe newly divided. Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, put the choice facing the continent starkly: either a “system of joint responsibility for security and peace” or “spheres of influence,” which she compared to the carve-up of Europe into Allied and Soviet spheres at Yalta in 1945.

Sixty-two percent of Ukrainians don’t want him to run for re-election, and if an election were held today, he’d garner about 25 percent of the vote — down from the 30 percent he easily won in the first round of the 2019 election. He’d still be likely to win, but the historic 73 percent he scored in the second round feels like a distant memory.  The president’s tense relationship with the press doesn’t help, either. A former actor used to the sound of applause, Mr. Zelensky is notoriously thin-skinned when it comes to criticism and challenging questions. He is visibly irritated by traditional journalists: In November, this fractious approach led to unseemly confrontations at a news conference.  It’s not just the media Mr. Zelensky struggles to work with. His first year in charge was chaotic. His hastily assembled team quickly fell apart, and yesterday’s allies turned into some of his harshest critics. There were constant reshuffles. New ministers were given very little time to prove themselves and were kicked out if they didn’t.  The churn eventually stopped, but at a cost. Mr. Zelensky, stung by the fallout, came to largely rely on the loyal rather than the qualified. A former movie producer and longtime friend was made chief of staff, joining other friends and confidants of Mr. Zelensky in wielding outsize power. The security service is overseen by a childhood friend, a former corporate lawyer, and the president’s party in Parliament is run by a loyal former I.T. businessman. The circle around the president has become an echo chamber.  In the process, Mr. Zelensky has turned into a version of the politician he campaigned against: insular, closed off, surrounded by yes men. In normal circumstances, that would be bad enough. But now, when Ukraine is menaced by Russia, it may be affecting Mr. Zelensky’s judgment.  That’s become ever clearer in recent weeks. As the West pursued megaphone diplomacy to discourage an invasion, Mr. Zelensky tried to downplay the threat. But this understandable effort to project calm and steady skittish markets was undermined by his showy style.  In a tone-deaf address in January, for example, a patronizing Mr. Zelensky effectively mocked Ukrainians for their proneness to panic and laughed off a possible invasion. The very next day, he claimed Russia might invade Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Instead of being comforted, the country was confused. No wonder 53 percent of Ukrainians think Mr. Zelensky won’t be able to defend the country if there is an invasion.

Oil prices had been essentially flat over the last week as traders anticipated a potential nuclear deal with Iran that could allow the country to bring millions of gallons of oil to the market. But with tensions ratcheting up along the Russia-Ukraine border, oil markets opened in evening trading more than a dollar a barrel higher. In a sign of the volatility of the market, prices eased later on Sunday night and were down about 50 cents a barrel.  President Biden and other senior American officials have said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has already decided to invade Ukraine despite the threat of crippling sanctions. Any invasion would most likely interrupt Russian natural gas and oil shipments to parts of Europe and then be followed by a decline in purchases of Russian energy by the West. Nevertheless, negotiations continued on several fronts.  The United States and many other industrialized countries will most likely release millions of barrels of oil from their strategic reserves as soon as a significant invasion occurs. There is also talk in Washington of suspending federal taxes on gasoline. Such measures could help restrain prices at the pump, at least for a short time.

Russia says its buildup of troops and weapons is part of planned military exercises. Satellite images, social media videos and photos show the scale and intensity of some of Russia’s latest deployments. The situation is volatile, and Russia’s military movements continue to cause fear and confusion. Satellite imagery from Sunday shows the arrival of new equipment, and vehicles being repositioned at a site just 17 miles from Ukraine. U.S. officials and independent military experts say at least half of Russia’s battalion tactical groups, which are designed for ground combat, have been deployed near Ukraine. Vehicles transporting short-range ballistic missile systems called Iskanders appear to be moving closer to the border, as seen here in Western Russia in February. Satellite images show that these types of weapons were also moved to a site in Belarus in January, putting them within range of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. And in mid-February, there was a new addition to the site: a field hospital. Another field hospital was also set up in Crimea, the part of Ukraine that was seized by Russia in 2014. In the same area, satellite images show a new camp for troops, which could indicate a higher level of military readiness. And in Belarus, videos show this Krasukha-4, one of Russia’s most powerful electronic warfare systems, about 50 miles from Ukraine. It has a range of up to 186 miles, and is typically used to interfere with military aircraft radar systems. Russia has also deployed helicopters, and more than half of these ground-attack aircraft recently arrived at an airfield in Belarus. It is also moved landing ships from Northern Europe that can transport tanks, armored vehicles and troops. Russia says 30 of its ships are taking part in live-fire exercises, but the fleet is also effectively blocking Ukraine’s ports, and further encircling the country.

For this brand-new BBC Two four-part series, they form two rival bands of musicians over the age of 64 and get them to rock out the main stage of the Isle of Wight Festival. It’s then up to the crowd of 65,000 to decide which band they love the most…  In just eight weeks, mentors Martin Kemp and Lady Leshurr audition and form their rock bands. Both Martin Kemp and Lady Leshurr also call-in help from top musical director friends as well as renowned stage performers including X-Factor finalist Fleur East, soul singer Mica Paris and the Darkness front man Justin Hawkins.  CT2  Lady Leshurr  Hello Lady Leshurr!  What made you want to get involved in the series Rock Till We Drop?  I wanted to get involved in this project because it’s something that’s never happened before. I always love being a part of something that is going to shift cultural perception. In my experience, I have found the music industry to be ageist at times; I have been asked to make my age younger, suggesting I don’t have a lot of time left if I want to make it, which is quite upsetting and frustrating because talent doesn’t have a time limit! It’s refreshing that there is now a TV show where the older generation gets an opportunity to showcase their talent and prove to the world that they still have what it takes.  What was the series highlight for you?  Meeting people from different walks of life - different ages, different accents - those that are older than me and have had so much experience within the music industry and their personal lives which is what has made them the person they are today. I think when I started choosing the people I wanted in my band and seeing them eventually meet was such a great thing to watch. I loved being there throughout to see their friendships blossom; I’m sure they have made friends for life!  What was one of the hardest things about making the series?  The hardest thing was not being able to be there for my band to show support when they performed at the Isle of Wight due to Covid. It was like I was there the whole way, and then at the final hurdle I couldn’t be there to support them.  What would you say to any musicians and singers out there who still feel it’s not too late for them?  I’d say keep pushing. There is no limit on anything in life. You can wake up tomorrow and be the biggest superstar in the world, or you can post a video and it can go viral within seconds. Nothing is guaranteed but anything is possible!  Can you share one golden piece of advice from your time and experience in the music industry?  One thing I had to learn the hard way is that you have to trust your gut. When things don’t feel right, chances are they aren't. You must surround yourself with positive, impactful people that only want the best for you and your career, otherwise it can mentally and spiritually break you - changing you into a person you never thought you’d be.  Rock Till We Drop introduces us to people from all walks of life and all ages, even a 95 year old drummer. What inspired you most about the people you met?  What inspired me the most about these talented people was that they still had so much more to give. It’s all about the fight, and the fact that they still had the confidence and the strength to audition, which shows a lot.  If you could be in a band like the two that appear in Rock Till We Drop – what would you name your band?  I think I’d call my band MOM. It would be an all female band and every band member would be a mother!  What will you take away / what have you learnt most about this generation of rockers?  I have learnt that they’ve got way more heart and passion than the younger generation!  Martin Kemp  What made you want to get involved in Rock Till We Drop?  I loved this the moment I first heard the idea; it’s the stuff dreams are made of, just when you think life has passed you by, an opportunity like this comes along.  To be able to give these bands a moment they have always dreamed of on one of the biggest festival stages in Britain was something I will never forget.  What was one of the hardest things about making the series?  The hardest thing has to be telling some of the guys that we couldn’t take them along to the next stage, as a performer I know how much that hurts…  What did you learn about yourself doing this project?  Just how much I miss being on that stage with a band, feeling the love of 65,000 people, it’s a buzz you just can’t recreate.  What would you say to any musicians and singers out there who still feel it’s not too late for them?  It’s never too late… You always have to remember, music is and should always be a hobby… even if you’re super successful, it’s still a hobby.  Can you share one golden piece of advice from your time and experience in the music industry?  Never change your artistic point of view for someone else’s. If you succeed it has to be your success and if you fail it has to be your failure.  Tell us about some of the challenges getting each band ready to play the Isle Of Wight main stage?  The main challenge getting the bands ready to play the IOW was turning them from solo musicians that mostly played in their living rooms to a band and getting them to understand that being in a band wasn’t just about playing music together but living and working together and how give and take plays a big part of making a band work.  If you could be in a band just like the two that appeared in Rock Till We Drop – what would your band name be?  STARDUST… because for ten minutes on a sunny afternoon in September some definitely spilled a tub of the stuff on these guys.  What will you take away / what have you learnt most about this generation of rockers?  That for some, life can be like a good rock song with its climax in the last 16 bars…  Meet Lady Leshurr’s Band  Lead singer - Bette aged 77, Barnsley  Bette is a miner’s daughter from Barnsley Yorkshire who got into singing as a child after her father made her stand on the table and sing to his mates after work. Bette left for London with £5 in her pocket and made it as a club singer although sadly she missed out on the lead part of the West End production of Hair, as she felt she didn’t have the acting talents.  Prior to lockdown, Bette found herself performing once a month at her local club night. However, with the crowds at just under 200 people, it’s a long way from the thousands at the Isle of Wight Festival.  When she’s not performing, Bette enjoys retirement. She looks after friends’ pets, enjoys walking, drinking coffee and watching tv – a far cry from that of your usual lead singer in a rock band.  Guitarist - Martin aged 67, West Sussex  Postman Martin, lives in a static caravan with his wife in West Sussex. When he was in his 30’s, life was very different touring in a band called Peep Show who featured in Kerrang! magazine and played gigs at Reading Festival. Peep Show disbanded and two of the members went on to play with Grace Jones and Shane McGowan, whereas Martin took up a job as a postman.  Martin plays his own songs and rarely does covers - his main styles of music are rock, blues, funk, reggae and soul.  Martin’s rockstar energy and talent wowed mentor Lady Leshurr at the auditions but he was gracious enough to accept the role of lead guitarist instead of lead singer.  Bass player - Carol aged 72, Manchester  Following years of being overlooked by most bands for being female, Carol proved herself by performing in countless bands over the years. At school she started her first girl trio, singing in harmony and playing guitar. Carol’s band once spent an afternoon singing with Tom Jones and shared the same manager that worked with 10cc and Herman’s Hermits.  In 1968 Carol started playing bass professionally and singing back-up vocals in bands touring the UK and Europe. In the 70’s and 80’s Carol ran her own recording studio with her husband and went on to become a wedding and party band musician.  Carol stopped teaching music during lockdown and it put a stop to much of her musical career.  She loves many styles of music and has played everything from big band, Motown, soul, blues, pop and funk.  Back up Guitar/Bass - Brian aged 65, Winchester  Brian was discovered by “the guy that signed Bryan Adams and The Police.” He also recorded in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio but somewhere along the way, things didn’t work out long-term. “There were failures and it hurt. Life has been Plan B”. Brian has a busy family life with four children and took up work as a painter and decorator.  At the age of 61, Brian realised he had lived his entire life with undiagnosed ADHD. Brian is now proud of his ADHD and describes it as his gift and super-power.  Brian is a talented guitarist and bassist and with a vast musical repertoire, he can pick up any song quickly and easily which we discover becomes vitally important as the Isle of Wight Festival draws closer…  Keys - Steve aged 68, North London  Steve is a jack of all trades and has been a cabby, teacher, civil servant and delivery driver.  In the 80’s he was a founding member of the Brit-funk band ‘Central Line’ however he left just before they got a hit single.  Steve has played keys for a number of famous faces including Barry White, Hot Chocolate and Des’ree. Despite this, Steve says, “the ship never came in for me.”  Steve lives in North London and works as a session musician. He is delighted to make it into Lady Leshurr’s band, bringing fun and energy to her line-up.  Drummer - Arty aged 73, Runcorn  Liverpudlian Arty is a man full of determination who doesn’t let anything hold him back. Arty lives with a disability. He contracted polio as a baby and has been a wheelchair user ever since.  When he was 16, Arty asked his parents for a drum kit – when they replied, “You’ll never be able to play with your disability”, this was all the encouragement he needed. He formed a band and his determination paid off. He played in a band for many years and played alongside many of the Merseybeat scene stars.  Alongside music, Arty played wheelchair basketball for 40 years, which took him all over the world with Team GB.  Music wise if it wasn’t released before 1968, Arty probably hasn’t heard it, he is Merseybeat all the way.  Meet Martin Kemp's band  Co-lead Singer – Jimmy aged 74, Lancashire  Jimmy has a raw voice with performance levels to match. He grew up in the North East, living with his publican parents until he walked out in his late teens. He joined a band when he was 16 and has played music ever since.  Jimmy almost played for Tina Turner - he was a back-up keys player should anything go wrong in the middle of the tour, however when it did go wrong, he was in Ibiza and couldn’t be found!  Jimmy’s grandchildren call him the ‘Grand Dude’ and he wants to show them that he still has what it takes in his mid ‘70s.  As well as having an amazing soul voice, Jimmy can play keys and sax.  He lives with his wife in Newcastle and following Covid lockdowns like the majority of the band members, has been desperate to get out and perform.  Co-lead singer - Carmen aged 64, South London  Carmen has a beautiful soul voice and has never had the opportunity to sing professionally. She only came to singing in her mid ‘30s but often sang so quietly that people couldn’t hear her. After singing lessons Carmen’s teacher told her that due to hay fever, she could never turn into a professional singer.  She has only ever sung church music until now so how will Carmen take to rock or pop?  Carmen is recently single, having been in a relationship for the past 42 years. Now in her mid ‘60s, Carmen has moved into her own home and has the support of her adult daughters.  Guitar - Leburn aged 64, Bath  Leburn is American rock ‘n’ roll royalty who has found himself living in rural England and he says it’s “like being in the longest episode of the Archers.”  He has played with Marvin Gaye, Chaka Khan, Debbie Harry and formed a Reggae band. Leburn was also on the same stage as the Red Hot Chilli Peppers but life took a different turn when he lost everything to substance abuse.  Leburn made a fresh start with his wife and moved to the UK, he pulled pints and dreamed of the life he could have had. Now single he lives in a bedsit in Bath doing the occasional gig. “I get paid £70 and it costs me £30 in travel – sometimes the only thing for dinner is an onion.”  With the promise of a festival stage and a crowd shouting for more – will a place in Martin’s band bring back Leburn’s ambition and fire for playing?  Bass - Richard aged 72, Sunbury-on-Thames  Richard started playing the guitar at boarding school. He has worked as an engineer for most of his life, including electronics for concord, hearing aid technology and mostly recently repairing industrial catering equipment.  Richard lives with his pet bird in a cottage in Sunbury on Thames.  Richard finds any opportunity he can to get out and play music – whether that be at the local food bank or care home. He says it’s his way to get him out of the house.  Richard’s family haven’t seen him perform for years.  Keys - Eileen aged 80, Aberdeen  80-year-old Eileen started her musical journey during World War 2 when as a child, she used to listen to “all the wonderful singers that were around”. She started playing songs on the piano simply by ear and insists she does read music now.  Relentlessly upbeat, Eileen played for the Royal Family for 25 years at an annual ball, and describes it as, “wonderful, just wonderful”. Over the years she has met the Queen Mother, the Queen and the late Princess Diana.  Eileen still regularly plays in a church band with her children.  Drums - Roy aged 95, Bedfordshire  Roy has been a semi-professional drummer since the age of 16. When Roy was 20, he was in reserved occupation during the war and became a well-known West End drummer. Roy used to play gigs in Working Men’s Clubs and then larger venues across the UK.  Roy now lives with his wife, who he met when he was 50 and married at 51. Roy has no other family apart from his wife’s nieces and nephews.  Roy retired on the eve of his 87th birthday and still plays practice drums at home, he also continues to indulge in his passion for listening to music.  Replacement drums – Barry aged 79, Kent  Barry has been playing the drums since 1961 but in order to make a living, he worked as an electrician until retiring 14 years ago.  Barry joined a band called Gambler in the 1970’s who he still plays with today.  When Barry was 21, he signed to record label Decca and recorded two singles with a band called The Limeys.  Barry also worked as a promoter booking David Bowie and his band for just £50, before they hit the big time.  Barry met Martin Kemp’s musical director Toby Chapman when he was 14 years old, when he asked Tony to join his band. Now Toby is able to give something back to Barry by asking him to be a part of this incredible experience playing at the Isle of Wight Festival in front of a huge live audience.  Barry lives with his wife Maggie of 58 years in Kent and has two daughters, five grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.

We met the 65-year-old queuing in a hangar, at the Novotroitske crossing point in eastern Ukraine.  It sits on the "line of contact" - an almost 500km (310 mile) long fissure between Ukrainian government territory and two enclaves that have been held by Russian backed separatists since 2014. Families, communities, and services are divided by this line. The enduring conflict here on the eastern front has already claimed more than 14,000 lives - at least 3,000 of them civilians, according to the United Nations.  The self-styled Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) are recognised by no one - for now, not even the Kremlin - but they are home to about four million people. Larysa is one of them. She was wrapped up against the cold in a bright blue jacket, pink jumper, and matching woolly hat. She preferred not to use her last name.  It takes permission and patience to get from Ukrainian government territory to the other side. Larysa knows the drill.  "I do this every six months," she said. "I have been for a check-up at a hospital in Dnipro [in central Ukraine] and now I am going home to Donetsk."  As she waited for sniffer dogs to check her bag, she wasn't too concerned about the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders.  "We have been bombed, and we have been through a lot," she said.  "I don't believe there will be an invasion, or if there is, it won't be a big one. That's my view as someone with intuition. I watch TV and what politicians say. I think all of this is just to keep us on our toes and stop us from getting too relaxed."  But Western leaders have long feared that President Vladimir Putin would fake a crisis in the Russian-backed rebel areas - or the appearance of one - to use as an excuse to invade. The seeds were sewn on Friday when rebel leaders announced that women and children would be evacuated over the border to Russia because Ukraine was planning to attack. Ukraine denied that and most civilians in those areas appear to have stayed put.  Read the full story

The device had picked up a signal from a transmitter that she and colleagues had previously attached to a Swainson's thrush, a small brown and white speckled bird native to the Americas. The same signal had popped up on Morales' handheld receiver a few days earlier, emanating from exactly the same bush in a park on the edge of Montreal in Canada.  This was a worry. It seemed so unlikely that the transmitter remained attached to a live bird – more likely, it had fallen off and was hanging on a branch. Just to make sure, Morales, a graduate student at McGill University, gave the berry-laden shrub a gentle shake – and then a flutter of feathers among the branches and shadows caught her eye. To her surprise, the thrush, very much alive and healthy, was hopping about the bush in protest at having been disturbed. This little bird had hung around for longer than she expected.  Swainson's thrushes migrate from northern areas to Central and northern South America every autumn. But some make a "pit stop" in and around cities such as Montreal. For a study published last month, Morales and her colleagues had been researching how Swainson's thrushes balance the need to migrate quickly – so as to maximise its benefits – with the need to refuel, such as by stopping over in places like Montreal. They caught and radio tagged a total of nearly 80 of the birds.  Huge numbers of migrating birds visit cities all around the world on their extraordinary journeys, which often cover thousands of kilometres. It is not always obvious why they come to urban locations. Some appear to be attracted by light. Others, such as the Swainson's thrush in its bush full of berries, seem to enjoy the food on offer. But cities are not always friendly to outsiders.  The death toll, sadly, is staggering. Some migrating birds, for example, are killed by domestic cats while others collide with buildings. Many thousands of birds die every year in New York alone when they crash into the brightly lit windows of skyscrapers, a well-known problem in megacities (Read more from BBC Future about why this happens). More recently, a flock of blackbirds was filmed dropping from the sky onto a street in the city of Chihuahua in north-west Mexico, leaving many dead.  And yet, scientists are discovering that towns, while dangerous, can sometimes help to support migrating species. So how do we ensure that cities act more as travel lodges – and not death traps – for these species?  During their study, Morales and her colleagues found that Swainson's thrushes make surprisingly long stopovers in Montreal, where many of the birds moult – a process through which the birds shed and regrow some of their feathers. That helps to prepare them for the long migration. It's like putting a new set of tyres on your car.

The incident happened on Saturday, during a visit close to areas controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  Ukraine confirmed the group were evacuated to a safe shelter.  Russia has denied claims of an imminent invasion, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region.

The UK prime minister added people need to understand the "sheer cost in human life" that the outbreak of war in Ukraine could entail for both sides.  Russia has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region, accusing the West of "hysteria".
