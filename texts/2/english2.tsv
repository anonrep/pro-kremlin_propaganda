Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Tuesday tweeted video of the explosion in Kharkiv’s Freedom Square, calling it a “barbaric Russian missile strike” and accusing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “murdering innocent civilians”.

INCREASE PRESSURE, ISOLATE RUSSIA FULLY! pic.twitter.com/tN4VHF1A9n — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 1, 2022  The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said successive Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv, including the latest on the central administration building, amounted to state terrorism and a war crime.  “Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately, Zelenskiy said. “Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves.”  In an emotional address to the European parliament, Zelenskiy said Ukraine “has a desire to see our children alive – I think it is a fair one. We are fighting for survival. We are fighting to be equal members of Europe. We are exactly the same as you are.”  01:10 'Everything has changed': Ukrainian president speaks after Kharkiv missile attack – video  More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were also killed in the eastern city of Okhtyrka, between Kharkiv and Kyiv, in a Russian missile strike on a military base, local officials said, giving conflicting accounts of when the attack on the barracks took place.  On the sixth day of fighting since Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine, the failure of its armed forces, amid continuing stiff resistance, to capture a single major city has led western countries to warn that commanders may increasingly bomb civilian areas.  International sanctions and global financial isolation, which have had a sudden and devastating impact on Russia’s economy, with the rouble in freefall and long queues outside banks, may further increase the Kremlin’s frustration, observers have said.  “The Russian advance on Kyiv has made little progress over the past 24 hours, probably as a result of continuing logistical difficulties,” the British defence ministry said in a military intelligence update on Tuesday.  But it warned that the apparent shift in Russian tactics would inevitably put Ukrainian civilians at much greater peril, saying: “The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.”  At least 136 civilians have been killed, including 13 children, and 400 have been injured since the start of the invasion last week, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday, adding that the real toll would almost certainly be much higher.  The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster and vacuum bombs were fakes, adding it was “out of the question” that sanctions would “force us to change our position” on the invasion, which Russia calls a “special operation” to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine.  The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said at a press conference in Warsaw with his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, that it was clear Putin was “prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics”.  The eastern city of Kharkiv had already come under heavy fire on Monday, with at least nine people – including three children – killed and 37 injured by missile strikes hitting civilian areas. “It’s not just a war, this is a massacre of Ukrainian people,” the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said.  One Okhtyrka resident, Igor, said the city had been attacked every day since 24 February hitting not just military but also civilian targets, sometimes with thermobaric rockets. “It’s awful – I feel angry and desperate,” he told the Guardian.  00:44 Soldiers search through rubble in Okhtyrka after apparent Russian shelling – video  Human rights groups and Ukraine’s ambassador to the US have accused Russia of using cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that are normally banned in civilian areas. The US said it had no confirmation of their use.  The key south-eastern city of Mariupol, which separatists have said they aim to encircle with 24 hours, was without electricity following multiple missile attacks from advancing Russian forces, while reports said the southern city of Kherson was surrounded.  Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called on Russia to end the war, calling it “totally unacceptable”, but added that “as a defensive alliance” the organisation would not send troops or combat jets to avoid becoming part of the conflict.  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have abandoned their homes to escape the Russian advance and more than 500,000 have fled the country, according to the UN refugee agency, with thousands await passage at European border crossings.  Ukraine’s general staff said Russian losses since the attack, the largest invasion of a European country since the end of the cold war, included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft and 198 tanks. The figures could not be verified.  The escalation in shelling and missile strikes in Ukraine’s urban areas came as a Russian military column gathering to the north of Kyiv was estimated to be 40 miles (64km) long, more than double its size three days ago.  “For the enemy, Kyiv is the key target,” Zelenskiy said in an overnight video message. “We did not let them break the defence of the capital, and they send saboteurs to us … We will neutralise them all.”  According to the US satellite company Maxar, the Russian armoured convoy was 17 miles (25km) from the centre of the Ukrainian capital, a city normally home to 3 million. US intelligence has warned Russia was attempting to encircle Kyiv.  A Russian military convoy north of Ivankiv on 28 February.

US senators warned overnight of a “long and bloody fight ahead” after receiving classified briefings evoking the spectre of a protracted battle over the capital and “street to street combat” against Russian forces.

Photograph: Maxar Tech/AFP/Getty Images  As an unprecedented raft of international sanctions began to bite, including crippling measures against Russia’s central bank preventing it from using its $630bn of foreign reserves to prop up the rouble, the oil giant Shell became the latest western firm to announce it was pulling out of Russia.  BP and Norway’s Equinor have also said they are quitting the country, which relies on oil and gas for export earnings, while multiple major banks, airlines and carmakers have ended partnerships, halted shipments and denounced the Russian invasion.  The shipping group Maersk followed other international transport groups on Tuesday in saying it was suspending all container shipments to and from Russia except those containing food, medical and humanitarian supplies.  The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the sanctions would “bring about the collapse of the Russian economy”, adding that the west was “waging total economic and financial war on Russia”.  The EU late on Monday added top Kremlin-linked oligarchs, including Igor Sechin, head of the state oil giant Rosneft; Nikolay Tokarev of pipeline group Transneft, the metals magnate Alexei Mordashov, tycoon Alisher Usmanov and businessman Gennady Timchenko, to its sanctions blacklist.  In the cultural arena, three major film studios, Sony, Disney and Warner Bros, said they were pausing cinema releases in Russia, and YouTube is in the process of blocking Russia’s state-backed news channels RT and Sputnik in Europe.  Russia has also been barred from most major sporting competitions, while World Taekwondo has stripped Putin himself, who is passionate about martial arts and his athletic prowess, of his honorary black belt because of the invasion.

In the speech made by videolink from Kyiv, the Ukrainian president said his people, including those killed by missile strikes on Tuesday in the country’s second city, Kharkiv, were sacrificing their lives for European ideals in the fight against the invading Russian forces.  “Nobody’s going to break us. We’re strong, we’re Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive, I think it is a fair one”, Zelenskiy said. “We are fighting for survival. We are fighting to be equal members of Europe.”  He went on: “We are exactly the same as you are. So do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine”.  On Tuesday, Ukraine’s envoy to the EU formally handed over a request for membership of the European Union to the French ambassador, whose country holds the rolling presidency.  Addressing MEPs, and Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European Commission and council respectively, Zelenskiy said the EU was “going to be much stronger with us, that’s for sure. Without you, Ukraine is going to be lonesome”.  The impassioned appeal received a cautiously positive welcome from the two leaders of the EU’s institutions as they took to the podium at the front of the parliament’s hemicycle.  “The council (of EU governments) will have to seriously look at the symbolic, political and legitimate request that has been made and make the appropriate choice in a determined and clear-headed manner,” Michel said.  Von der Leyen said there was a “long path ahead”. “We have to end this war,” she said. “And we should talk about the next steps. But I am sure: nobody in this hemicycle can doubt that a people that stands up so bravely for our European values belongs in our European family.”  The path to membership will require the commission to give a positive assessment as to Ukraine’s potential candidature, a process that can take up to 18 months. There would then be a transitional period of indefinite length during which Ukraine would need to adopt the entirety of EU law.  Slovenia and Poland have called on EU member states to take “quick and courageous decisions” to ensure that Ukraine can join the EU by 2030. But there is some scepticism in other capitals about the wisdom of further expansion.  Zelenskiy told MEPs that he was speaking to them between Russian bombardments.  “You know, I don’t read off the paper, off the sheet,” he said. “Because the time of paper in the life of my country has ended.”  Today would be the last for some of those fighting for Ukraine’s freedom, he added. “We are giving away our best people, the strongest ones, the most value based ones”.  “This morning was a very tragic one for us: two cruise missiles hit Kharkiv, the city, which is located on the borders of the Russian Federation”, he said. “Can you imagine two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square? Dozens were killed. This is the price of freedom.”  01:10 'Everything has changed': Ukrainian president speaks after Kharkiv missile attack – video  In Geneva, numerous diplomats walked out of the room when Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, addressed the UN human rights council via a pre-recorded video message, after a similar boycott of his speech at the nearby Conference on Disarmament.  Diplomats gathered outside the Conference on Disarmament hall in front of a Ukrainian flag and applauded loudly. The applause could be heard in the chamber where Lavrov’s speech continued, with only a handful of ambassadors from countries including Yemen, Syria, Venezuela and Tunisia there to hear it.

Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, also pressed Johnson over the collective refusal of Nato countries to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.  Kaleniuk told Johnson, who was giving a press conference in Warsaw after talks with his Polish counterpart, that she was from Kyiv and had passed across the border into Poland in recent days.  “Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone,” she said.  “What’s the alternative for the no-fly zone? Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of world war III but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit.  “You are talking about more sanctions, prime minister, but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.”  Johnson responded: “I just want to say I am acutely conscious there is not enough we can do as the UK government to help in the way that you want. I’ve got to be honest about that. When you talk about the no-fly zone … unfortunately the implication of that is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be engaged in direct combat in Russia. That’s not something we can do.”  He said the UK had been among the first to “tighten the economic noose” around Putin’s regime, and “Putin and Putin alone” was responsible for the suffering of the Ukrainian people.  Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who recently passed stewardship of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation, is said to have gone to Belarus to try to help negotiate peace. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, told parliament last Thursday that Abramovich should be sanctioned.  Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned.  Johnson is coming under mounting pressure over the UK’s slowness to bring in sanctions against oligarchs close to Putin, with the only asset freezes and travel bans so far brought in targeting Gennady Timchenko, Russia’s sixth richest oligarch, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg.  Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, has listed in parliament 35 Russians who have been suggested by the imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny as possible targets for sanctions.  Johnson on Tuesday acknowledged more could be done to tighten sanctions. “There is plainly more to be done on [the payments system] Swift, we can tighten up yet further on Swift, even though it has had a dramatic effect already, I think we do need to go further,” he said.  “There’s more to be done on Sberbank, there’s more to be done on the freezing of Russian assets. I think there’s genuine amazement and dismay in Russia about what has happened already but there is more to be done.”  There could be more “severing of sporting links” and “cracking down on the billionaires associated with Vladimir Putin,” he added.

Russian forces have launched rocket attacks that killed “dozens” of civilians in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, and began a renewed assault on the capital, Kyiv.  At least nine people have been killed, including three children, and 37 wounded in one day after the shelling in the Kharkiv, the city’s mayor said.  The southern Ukraine city of Kherson is “surrounded” by Russian soldiers, according to accounts by a Ukrainian journalist, Alyona Panina, and the city’s mayor.  The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.  Satellite images taken on Monday show a Russian military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64km), Reuters reports.  Russia used a vacuum bomb on Monday in its invasion of Ukraine, according to Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US.  The US has promised further sanctions against Russia and more weapons for Ukraine’s military, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.  The office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) has reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead.  Canada will supply upgraded ammunition and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, prime minister Justin Trudeau said.  The Ukrainian president has called for a no-fly zone for Russian missiles, planes and helicopters following the attack on Kharkiv.  Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy also signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. A senior EU official said leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March.  Ukraine has opened its border to foreigners willing to fight. Ukraine’s president has issued a decree temporarily lifting requirements for entry visas.  Fifa and Uefa have suspended Russia’s national and club teams from all international competitions until further notice.  The US will expel 12 members of Russia’s UN mission, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security.

The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, said on Tuesday morning that Gergiev’s contract had been terminated with immediate effect. It came a day after the conductor’s management dropped him for refusing to end what it said was his “long-expressed support” for a “criminal regime”.  The decision leaves Gergiev, hailed as one of world’s greatest conductors, more or less isolated in the world of classical music. The Scala in Milan, the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden and the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg have also cut their ties with the 68-year-old.  The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, which has run an annual Gergiev festival since 1996, is expected to cancel its event this September if the conductor does not end his support for Putin.  In the US, Gergiev had already been replaced for several performances by the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in New York and in Naples, Florida, and for two performances again at Carnegie Hall in May where he was due to lead St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Orchestra, of which he is music director.  Reiter said in a statement that Gergiev, who had been the chief conductor at the Munich Philharmonic since 2015, had refused a demand that he “distance himself unambiguously and unapologetically from the brutal war of aggression which Putin is leading against Ukraine and now in particular also against our partner city, Kyiv.”  Reiter had appealed to the conductor in a letter on Friday to condemn the war, giving him until Monday evening to do so. “In the current situation, a clear signal for the orchestra, its audience, the general public and politics would be essential in order to enable further cooperation,” he said.  Marcus Felsner, Gergiev’s former manager, on Sunday called him “the greatest conductor alive and an extraordinary human being with a profound sense of decency” but said he had no choice but to let him go as he “will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes.”  He said: “In the light of the criminal war waged by the Russian regime against the democratic and independent nation of Ukraine, and against the European open society as a whole, it has become impossible for us, and clearly unwelcome, to defend the interests of Maestro Gergiev.”  Felsner, who signed Gergiev in 2020, called it “the saddest day of my professional life”.  Over the years, Gergiev’s close friendship with the Russian president, which began in the early 1990s, has drawn increasing criticism, particularly since the annexation of Crimea.  In 2014, Gergiev was a signatory to an artists’ appeal that supported the annexation and in which he stated his clear support for Putin’s political views. In 2012 he appeared in an advert supporting Putin’s presidential campaign and in 2016 he conducted a concert in the Syrian city of Palmyra for an audience of Russian soldiers, government ministers and journalists after its capture from Islamic State.  There has so far been no public reaction from Gergiev, and his US agent has yet to respond.

A GoFundMe page organised by a senior executive from the Kyiv Independent has raised more than £150,000 for national and regional titles scrambling to survive the chaos precipitated by the Russian invasion five days ago.  Funds are being earmarked to help journalists relocate operations from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in peril to Warsaw, Vilnius and other neighbouring capitals, said Jakub Parusinski, chief financial officer at the Kyiv Independent and the campaign’s organiser. Separate initiatives are also under way to help secure funds for urgent immediate needs such as equipment, insurance and engineering support for websites, he said.  “What we really need right now is for the world to have trusted, verified information from across the country, so that people in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus know exactly what is going on,” said Parusinski. “However important foreign correspondents from overseas news organisations are, you need local media to tell the local story.”  Around 12 national titles, including the Kyiv Independent and in-depth reportage news website Zaborona, are part of the group that will benefit from funds raised. A first round of disbursals from the emergency fund is due to be made as early as next week, Parusinski said.  The GoFundMe effort will be aimed specifically at helping newsrooms relocate away from danger.  “For any newsroom in Kyiv, the logic looks like this: you have a small portion of your team who will stay and effectively become war correspondents,” said Parusinski. “The rest are moving west to run the website and operational stuff in places like Warsaw, Vilnius or Bratislava. We are helping to get the journalists out and set up in other capitals.”  Kateryna Sergatskova, editor in chief of Zaborona, said many of her journalists were staying in Kyiv “working from the shelters under the attacks” to uncover the true face of war.  She welcomed the prospect of funding to help underwrite the operational costs of emergency reporting and to establish a temporary operational hub.  “Independent media are covering the actual events of the war and provide accurate, unbiased information at a time of an information war,” she said.

Putin was speaking in January, days after the country’s central bank proposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining. In the case of bitcoin, the cornerstone cryptocurrency, mining is the energy-intensive process by which computers verify new bitcoin transactions – putting them on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain – and generate new bitcoins as a reward for that work.  The Bank of Russia was emphatic in its warning, saying that cryptocurrency mining entailed “significant risks for the economy and financial stability.”. One week later, Putin appeared to be less sure, pointing that Russia had advantages in cryptocurrency mining due to its huge energy wealth and expertise in the field.  Putin’s doubts about a full crypto-embargo might well have deepened after the west applied massive pressure to Russia’s financial system with new sanctions. The EU, US, UK and Canada have targeted the country’s $640bn (£478bn) in foreign currency reserves – a financial buffer held as a back-up to deal with emergencies and provide financial stability – by agreeing to “prevent the Russian central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions”.  The same group have also announced that unnamed Russian banks will be expelled from Swift, the main global payments messaging system used by banks to make cross-border money transfers.  Russia and its banks could be looking at cryptocurrencies more closely because they could represent an alternative medium of international exchange to the dollar. Cryptocurrencies could also bypass the international banking system that is key to enforcing sanctions as a listening post for financial transactions worldwide (a characteristic of cryptocurrencies that watchdogs and central banks dislike), by offering an alternative way to make irreversible cross-border transactions.  “We’re at a watershed moment in global history where central banks of nation-states are no longer in direct control of the financial instruments once used to impose global regulations. With cryptocurrency in its infancy, these decentralised currencies lack the agency and infrastructure needed for the ability to regulate institutions as large as Russia,” says Eric Michaud, co-founder of Off The Chain, a blockchain security conference.  Other crypto experts argue, however, that the transparent nature of blockchains makes it difficult for sanctioned entities to use cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions.  Nonetheless, some nation states have turned to bitcoin for an escape. Iran, heavily sanctioned by the US but with substantial fossil-fuel reserves, effectively converts its excess energy into cash by acquiring bitcoins off Iran-based bitcoin miners (powered by fossil-fuel generated electricity) and using the currency to buy imports.  “The Iranian state is … effectively selling its energy reserves on the global markets, using the Bitcoin mining process to bypass trade embargoes,” said Elliptic, a blockchain consultancy that helps clients combat crypto-related crime, in a blog post last year.  Elliptic’s director of policy and regulatory affairs, David Carlisle, says crypto mining is “one of the most feasible options” for Russia, which is already the third-largest country for bitcoin mining according to data from the University of Cambridge.  “In addition to actually minting crypto that can be used to trade with governments, Russia can tax the underlying money activity as well. They can license and tax the activity itself,” says Carlisle. Elliptic estimates that the Iranian government could make about $1bn a year from Bitcoin mining. Carlisle adds: “Once it’s in possession of large amounts of bitcoin that it’s mined, Russia can then use that Bitcoin to pay for imports of goods and services that it might otherwise struggle to access, owing to US and European restrictions.”  However, the Wall Street Journal reported last week that the US is considering imposing sanctions on Russia’s cryptocurrency market. Companies such as Elliptic offer software that lets businesses spot illegal crypto transactions.  According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, the transparent nature of blockchains makes it difficult to use cryptocurrencies as a basis for cloak-and-dagger sanctions dodging. “Sanctions evasion activity is captured on public, permanent, immutable blockchain ledgers,” says Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis.  Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced extensive sanctions against Russian businesses and elites following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. This has prompted many to ask Chainalysis how Russia may attempt to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions. — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) February 25, 2022  There remain other paths that Russian actors could use, including the North Korean route of hacking cryptocurrency platforms, which raised $400m for Kim Jong-un’s state last year alone, according to Chainalysis.  There are also ransomware attacks, where criminal groups encrypt a target’s computers and demand cryptocurrency in exchange for unfreezing them, although Russia’s FSB security agency recently claimed to have dismantled the REvil ransomware group. Last year, the US treasury department sanctioned two Russian-owned cryptocurrency exchanges, SUEX OTC and Chatex, for allegedly helping launder ransomware proceeds. On Monday, crypto exchange Binance said it was blocking the accounts of any Russian clients targeted by sanctions.  According to Elliptic’s Carlisle, the Russian state could use a network of exchanges to conceal crypto ownership. “If the Russian government or Russian entities wanted to look to ways to evade sanctions using crypto, they could try to develop a network of complicit exchange services that would help them do that,” he says. There are also cryptocurrencies that are difficult to trace, such as the privacy-focused Monero.  But Carlisle adds that the sheer scale of the financial restrictions facing Russia is such that cryptocurrencies will not suffice. “Crypto alone will never enable Russia to circumvent financial restrictions at the scale it needs to mitigate the full impact of restrictions; Russia’s total banking sector assets are $1.4tn – nearly the size of the entire crypto market.”  There are also alternatives to cryptocurrency. Ejecting Russian banks from Swift could encourage China to strengthen its own nascent payment network, Cross-Border International Payments System. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, says: “It would not be beyond the bounds of belief that China takes the Russian line on sanctions being unfair and provide a means to alleviate them by giving Russia the use of CIPS.”  Or the answer might be even closer to home. The Bank of Russia is developing its own digital rouble too.

Ukrainian scholars are warning of an “unfolding cultural catastrophe”, Getty said in a statement from James Cuno, the president and chief executive officer of the J Paul Getty Trust.  Fedir Androshchuk, the director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in Kyiv, said he was attempting to safeguard the museum from attack or looting alongside two colleagues.  “The museum is located in the middle of a rich cultural heritage area near three fine churches, but also close to some possible targets (the Ukrainian security service and border forces),” he wrote in an email to a Swedish academic.  Getty said Russian forces had begun destroying Ukraine’s cultural heritage, including the Ivankiv museum, about 50 miles north of Kyiv, which housed “precious Ukrainian folk art”.  Monuments at risk represent “centuries of history from the Byzantine to the baroque periods” and Unesco world heritage sites.  Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs tweeted on Monday that 25 works by the folk artist Maria Prymachenko held by the museum had been lost. “She created world-famous masterpieces. Her special gift and talent captivated Pablo Picasso,” said the ministry.

There are seven world heritage sites in Ukraine, including St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, which contains unique mosaics and frescoes from the early 16th century, and Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, an Orthodox monastery founded in 1051.  The entire ancient quarter of Lviv, dating from the 13th century, is also a world heritage site.  Lviv old town is a world heritage site. Photograph: Pavlo Palamarchuk/Reuters  Getty said: “The material cultural heritage of the world is our common heritage, the identity and inspiration for all humanity. Cultural heritage has the power to unite us and is critical for achieving peace.  “It is also too often the target of war, another way to destroy and overtake a society by erasing its memory.”  Much of the world’s ancient heritage had already suffered from “wanton destruction, looting, neglect, reckless overdevelopment, and climate change. To have even more lost to senseless war is unconscionable.”  Getty said he condemned “the cultural atrocities being committed now in Ukraine, together with the unfathomable human and environmental losses. We stand in solidarity with our Ukrainian colleagues. Protecting and preserving our cultural heritage is a core value of civilised societies. What is taking place in Ukraine is a tragedy of monumental proportions.”  In his email, Androshchuk said four museums – in Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Chernihiv – had “managed to take down and protect their main exhibitions. In Vinnytsia, the museum building is now partly used for internally displaced people. So far I have not heard that any of the aforementioned museums has been subject to looting or attack.”  But he added: “There is no guarantee that the Ukrainian cultural heritage will not be plundered and transferred to Russian museums, especially given that Kyiv has a special place in Putin’s interpretation of Russian history and its roots.  “Many finds made in Ukraine during the 1800s and early 1900s are already in the two finest Russian museums. And there is also evidence that objects from archaeological excavations in Crimea have been sent to the Hermitage in St Petersburg.”  There were “established instructions, dating to Soviet times, on what museums should do in case of armed conflict – to take down and hide objects in a certain order of priority and documentation. The problem is how to do all this with a lack of time and resources.  “You cannot force employees to come in and work under such circumstances. Many are fleeing with their families. But I am very proud of my colleagues. Many of them came to the museum and helped to dismantle the permanent exhibition…. After this effort, two archaeologists and two young historians, my young colleagues, headed straight to the front.  “At present, I see my mission as the following – to stay at the museum until the defence works.”

So let’s unite and show everyone a united and strong Russia!”  Ovechkin encouraged other Russian hockey stars such as Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Bure and Ilya Kovalchuk to sign up to his social media campaign, and changed his Instagram avatar to a photo of him alongside Putin.  It’s easy to imagine the smirk the Russian leader allowed himself at the sight of his new gladiatorial champion playing in front of adoring fans in DC of all places – the next year Ovechkin even hoisted the Stanley Cup for the Capitals. But it’s just as easy to picture Putin’s fury over Ovechkin’s comments following Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine last week.  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Thank you for your feedback.  “Well, he is my president,” the 36-year-old Ovechkin told a press conference a few days ago. “But how I said, I am not in politics. I am an athlete and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon. It’s a hard situation right now for both side and everything. Everything, I hope, is going to end. I’m not in control of the situation.  “Please, no more war.”  Mealy-mouthed as it was (“What!? Not only an alibist, a chicken shit, but also a liar!” spat Czech goaltending legend Dominik Hasek on Twitter, before calling on the NHL to suspend all Russian contracts), Ovechkin even tentatively distancing himself from Putin was a remarkable sign of something deeper. His words weren’t the strongest criticism of Putin from a Russian hockey player – that honour goes to Rangers left winger Artemi Panarin, who has also thrown his support behind opposition figure Alexei Navalny – but calling the Ukraine invasion a “war” at all is now a journalistic crime in Russia.  Of course, the dissent of other Russian athletes across the spectrum, such as rising tennis star Andrey Rublev writing “NO WAR PLEASE” on the camera lens after a victory last week, is brave considering what Putin does to dissidents, even those who live abroad. (Panarin is on leave after reports emerged in Russia that he supposedly beat up a teenage girl, allegations that the team calls a case of vengeful “intimidation” for his politics.)  But Ovechkin is no rising star. He is the pole star, “the Great Eight”, the charming and ebullient golden boy of the Great Russian Sport, perhaps hockey’s purest-ever scorer, now closing in on the previously inviolable goal record of Wayne Gretzky and doing so in the most glass-bangingly charismatic way possible.  What’s more, hockey isn’t just Russia’s sport. It’s Putin’s. The Russian leader likes to lace up, and has got populist mileage out of skating in farcical games where he “scores” improbable numbers of goals against professional players (and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko) who are clearly terrified of him. He once tripped over a red carpet on the ice; most of the players pretended not to see.  Just like the other action-figure poses that once made him something of an amusing meme, Rock’Em’Sock’Em Putin sends a specific message. Hockey has always been political for Russia and North America. The rink was where the cold war could get hot. Putin’s subsequent shame at the fall of the Soviet Union, too, is mirrored in what happened to Russian hockey.  In the dying days of the empire, prominent Soviet players led by Alexander Mogilny began to defect to the west, and when the USSR collapsed then so too did the once-unstoppable Red Army teams that had dominated international competition for decades. In the early 1990s an American investor from the Pittsburgh Penguins flew to Moscow to find the Red Army team playing to empty stands, their trophies in a dusty cabinet and a strip club in the basement. The investor rebranded the team as the Red Penguins and whipped up sellout crowds with pumping music, cheerleaders and American-style capitalist razzle-dazzle. Putin would have hated it. Slowly, however, organized crime muscled its way in to cream off the new profits, just as Putin himself rose to lead a kleptocratic Russia that he was determined would be macho on the world stage again. Under his watch the KHL, Russia’s version of the NHL, even began to poach NHL players in return.  So hockey is sensitive for Putin, and Ovechkin is sensitive for him, too. “As Putin’s favourite athlete, it’s significant that Ovechkin did not come out and endorse Putin’s war,” says Jack Todd, hockey writer for the Montreal Gazette. “It’s the first sign of any distance between Putin and one of his more enthusiastic supporters.” Todd argues that Ovechkin needs to do more, because he’s uniquely positioned to be heard: “Given Ovechkin’s position as a hero of the Russian people, it would be hard for Putin to retaliate against him, especially now when everything is crumbling.” Should Ovechkin and Panarin persuade the NHL’s Russian players to sign a joint letter asking Putin to withdraw from Ukraine, he notes, it could collectively insulate them from repercussions.  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.  For now, Ovechkin is playing the “I’m just an athlete” card so any such joint action looks unlikely in the short term. On Monday, the NHL condemned the invasion of Ukraine and urged “a peaceful resolution as quickly as possible”. The league added that it is cutting ties with its business partners in Russia, while acknowledging its players “and their families are being placed in an extremely difficult position”.  A stronger stance from Ovechkin and his compatriots in the NHL could hurt Putin’s support among the kind of Russians who do not read dissident media but take pride in their country’s international hockey pedigree. They may even start to question the “special military operation” in Ukraine.  After all, even the captain of PutinTeam now calls it a war.

The Guardian spoke to people living in countries near Ukraine about the situation, how they feel about their own safety and what it might mean for them.  ‘My heart breaks’  When the invasion happened on Thursday morning I burst into tears, then I contacted my family in Lithuania. It felt like it was 13 January, all over again, when the Soviet Union attacked us on in 1991, when Lithuania was trying for independence. I was a teenager then and it was like a nightmare, horror, the sound of guns – but it also brought Lithuanians closer together.  My father is Ukrainian. He is part of the older generation, who thought that the west was making up stories about the Russian invasion. My mum says he stopped watching the Russian news after the invasion.  We have family in Ukraine and are ready to welcome them to Lithuania or Brussels, where I am now living. After not hearing from my cousin, for a day, we got a message telling us that the Russian army was not far away and they were ready to fight till the end against the invasion. His son is in the Ukrainian army. I am afraid for their lives. My heart breaks.  I am afraid that Russia will invade Lithuania as well. And nobody will move a finger for us as we are so small. I pray it will not spread, because being independent matters. Kotryna, 45, from Lithuania and working in Brussels  ‘We’re anxious Putin might cut off the gas and oil supply’  Igor Dudkiewicz from Poznań, Poland.  The mood in Poland I think is generally good – no one is scared because I don’t think anyone really believes that Russia will try to attack a Nato member state. I am angry and frustrated about what is happening.  There is a lot of solidarity with Ukraine and a lot of us know someone from there. I took part in a protest on Thursday showing my support, and we’ve been trying to arrange donations.  We don’t think Putin will attack our country but we are anxious he might cut off the gas and oil supply. It’s the economic effect that is worrying people which is why some have started trying to stock up. Igor Dudkiewicz, 23, law student, Poznań, Poland  ‘Is your country going to be the next target?’  I felt very anxious when I heard about the invasion. I felt this rush of adrenaline and I just don’t know whatwould happen next. I felt like the people responsible for the invasion are completely insane. I couldn’t think of any proper justification for it. Ukraine is a country that has a similar culture to Slovakia and you begin to worry that what’s going on over there is going to come here. Is your country going to be the next target?  What worries me is that in Slovakia there are a lot of people who would like to step out of Nato. Recently we had a survey and about 40% of Slovaks felt that the US and Nato were responsible for the rising tensions in Ukraine.  I worry that there are a lot of people who may feel that this conflict is legitimate and caused by Nato and not by Russia, which of course is the utmost lie, but I don’t know how to counteract that. Michaela, 23, student, from Slovakia and living in London  ‘We’ve already made plans about where we will go if we are attacked’  Elza Stepiņa from Ogre, Latvia.  We’re all quite stressed. I skipped school today because the situation is quite hard to deal with. I’ll be back on Monday but on Thursday it was too much hearing talk about Russia possibly attacking us.  Before, we were scared to speak our minds because we were worried about being attacked, but we’ve realised that the Russian regime is not as powerful as it seemed. Latvia is a Nato member state and it would protect us if anything happened.  Both of my parents are in the military and I’m quite scared of losing them. I text my father constantly to ask how he’s doing and we watch the news all the time. Our government has said there is nothing to worry about but it doesn’t stop the panic.  We haven’t packed any emergency bags yet but we’ve made plans about where we will go in Latvia – a place where there is food and water reserves, and is not near any military bases.  Since 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia, we’ve understood that as long as Putin is in power in Russia there will always be a threat to us. At the time my dad packed his bags and was ready for army mobilisation. That was when we decided to make plans in case anything happens in Latvia. Elza, 18, student, Ogre, Latvia  ‘We have been afraid this could happen, and now it has’  Most people in the Baltics have been very depressed for the last two days. There’s a deep sense of pain as we have been afraid this could happen and now it has.  Most people want to stay optimistic and don’t want to plan for a war, however we have started discussing as a family where we would go if we needed to leave. It’s created a lot of uncertainty and some people are considering stocking up on food, at the same time many are level-headed and not massively panicking.  I feel like the west’s answer has been too weak for Russians and it’s time for the rest of Europe to get uncomfortable. The leaders in the west are being too slow in understanding the full horror of what is happening.  There is nothing really connecting us to Russia apart from our border. People in the Baltics have moved on from the Soviet era. We are hopeful and happy in Estonia that we have Nato membership, but at the same time we’re still uncertain as to whether they will really help us if anything happens. Tiiu-Ann, 37, production designer, Tallinn, Estonia  ‘I’m not sure about anything now’  Urszula Drabińska from Wołomin, Poland.  I think we’re all a bit nervous. I’m not panicking but I don’t feel safe and I sometimes think about how me and my husband can prepare for war here in Poland. On Thursday, there were queues at the cash machines in my home town. There’s been something in the air for a while so over time we have collected some food, like rice and beans, water, money and petrol and I’m considering different scenarios just in case.  I think if something happens our plan is to stay here as this is where my family lives, and where we have food and shelter. If we were to leave we would have nothing and have to depend on others to help us. When I think about the future I’m not sure about anything now. All I do know is that I wouldn’t believe anything Putin says.  Some of my friends are a bit disappointed that Poland hasn’t done more to help Ukraine. But maybe we see it in a different way because of our history, when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and we were left on our own with no help. Urszula Drabińska, 36, editor and proofreader, Wołomin, Poland  ‘I’m prepared to enrol in the army if my country needs me’  I’m part Ukrainian, my grandfather was from there. I was brought up in Romania but I feel a lot of sympathy for the Ukrainians. What Putin is doing is unforgivable, but the EU’s response to his actions is pretty surprising. Why does no one help Ukraine? Why just sanctions? I feel like Putin will get what he wants and go even further, because no one is stopping him. I worry that he will not stop at Ukraine’s borders.  With the humanitarian situation, I am proud that we are willing to take in refugees from Ukraine. I think we’re prepared to take about 500,000 of them. I felt really angry when I heard about the invasion and I’m prepared to enrol in the army if my country needs me. Mihai, 22, student, Romania

In 2008, I was asked by the organisers to give a special presentation on where Russia’s economy might be, by 2020, to the St Petersburg Summit, Russia’s own version of Davos. To my slight embarrassment, I hadn’t really appreciated that they would be quite irritated if I didn’t suggest that Russia was likely to be in the top five largest economies of the world by 2020, which I did realise afterwards, when my presentation and comments caused a bit of stir in the post-event coffee areas and media.  Essentially I suggested that given Russia’s challenging demographics, and that crude oil prices were unlikely to continue the one-way rise that had characterised the decade to date, Russia’s potential growth rate was probably not much more than 2%. And if they really wanted to have the powerful economic growth that had been experienced in (those) recent years, they needed to undertake significant reforms to boost productivity.  The reaction to my presentation among officialdom was my first real suspicion that Russia might have challenges ahead, which of course, was without realising the scale of chaos that was about to unfold in the global financial system and the subsequent economic collapse around much of the world. That set of circumstances contributed to a major multi-year peaking in oil prices, and much of what happened since, which for Russia, has been persistent economic disappointment.  I have no great expertise at geopolitics but I have broadly assumed in the past decade or so that Vladimir Putin had decided that his huge domestic popularity would decline because he couldn’t achieve the growth that had taken place pre-crisis. Nor could he really reform, because much of his personal financial benefit and those of some close to him depended on the status quo, so he had to shift to another platform, which was loosely based around the idea of making Russia great.  During those years, I got to know several senior technocrats in the policy world, primarily from the central bank and finance ministry, and leading economic influencers, and I was often struck by how widely the belief was about Putin’s excellence as a strategist.  I had for some years been expecting some great era of big reforms to be unleashed due to these views but alas, they never came, and instead, this game of playing on his perception of western weakness dominated his apparent strategic thinking.  Well, after the weekend just passed, and the western financial sanctions announced, it seems to me that Putin isn’t such a great strategist after all.  I don’t know where the idea of freezing the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves originated, but whoever thought of it has come up with a cracker, alongside the bold move by leading western nations to agree to remove key Russian banks from the Swift plumbing network of the financial system.  In one fell swoop, that announcement has essentially eradicated the relevance of Russia’s massive official foreign exchange reserves, and with it, sowed the seeds for big problems for the Russian economy. I had been thinking throughout recent weeks: how can a country that is no longer in the top 10 largest of the world’s economy (barely 2% of global GDP now) have such apparent military importance around the world? After the further collapse of the currency, the ability of Russia to remain anywhere near as important globally is starting to rapidly fade. Based on the exchange rate on Monday, Russia could at the end of 2022 rank no higher than 15th.  While the background to recent awful events had included a picture of increasing closeness between Beijing and Moscow, I suspect the Chinese leadership might be scathing about what Putin has provoked as a response from the west. Now any country thinking of using its supposed military might to pick on a small neighbour to the dislike of the western democratic alliance will have to calculate the consequences for their own central bank being frozen out of the system, and with it, economic warfare being used in such speedy form as a much more powerful form of influence.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Of course, there are many other aspects that go along in parallel, not least the remarkable shift in German policy on its own defence spending, its decision to pay for some weapons for Ukraine, and, of course, its sudden opposition to the previously agreed deal for a pipeline for more Russian gas. And with this, there has been a much more joined-up and robust EU policy response.  It is now likely the case that some thinkers around the large emerging economies will have to, once again, rethink their happy dependency on the western-dominated financial system, and it is not impossible that current events sow the seeds for a big reform of the global financial system. There is no way that is going to happen unless such countries, China included, shift their approach to the use of their currency, and with it, many aspects of their economic and related systems. As for Russia, some huge reflection on its leadership must surely soon occur.

The use of such weapons, which suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, has yet to be independently confirmed, though footage from Ukraine has shown thermobaric rocket launchers on Russia’s TOS-1 vehicles.  Dr Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said while it was not clear if they had been deployed yet by Russia in Ukraine, it was only “a matter of time”.  How do they work?  The thermobaric weapon, also known as an aerosol bomb or fuel air explosive, is a two-stage munition.  The first-stage charge distributes an aerosol made up of very fine material – from a carbon-based fuel to tiny metal particles. A second charge ignites that cloud, creating a fireball, a huge shock wave, and a vacuum as it sucks up all surrounding oxygen.  The blast wave can last for significantly longer than a conventional explosive and is capable of vaporising human bodies.  Such weapons are used for a variety of purposes and come in a range of sizes. Hellyer says what we may see in Ukraine is Russia using them in a “bunker-buster” role to destroy defensive positions. Extremely large, air-launched versions are designed to destroy caves and tunnel complexes.  Where have they been used?  The bombs have been used by Russian and western forces since the 1960s. The US relied on them in its attempts to eliminate al-Qaida in the mountains in Afghanistan. Hellyer said Russia had a longer track record with them than the west. “Russia has systems right across the spectrum … from quite small tactical weapons, to huge, air-launched bombs.  “The separatists that Russia was supporting in the Donbas region, they have been using them for a number of years now.”  In 2000, Human Rights Watch condemned Russia’s reported used of the weapons a year earlier in Chechnya as “a dangerous escalation” with “important humanitarian implications”.  How dangerous are they?  Hellyer said thermobaric weapons were effective at their “specific purpose” of “primarily destroying defensive positions”. While they would not be used to penetrate a tank, they could be a ““very destructive weapon” against an apartment complex or other building.  “They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders,” he said.  Given their use is “pretty standard” in terms of Russian tactics, Hellyer said he expected to see more thermobaric warfare in Ukraine.  “One of the things we know about Russian tactics is that they are willing to destroy everything.  “It’s clear that the Ukrainians are hunkering down in some of the cities … as that continues the Russians are going to resort more and more to using … whatever weapons they have including thermobaric weapons in built-up urban areas.”  Reuters contributed to this report

Russian forces have bombarded the government headquarters in Ukraine’s second biggest city, a huge armoured column is rolling towards the capital, and details have emerged of an attack that killed scores of Ukrainian soldiers in the east.  In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, at least 11 civilians died after Russian missile strikes on the government headquarters, according to Ukrainian officials.  About 70 miles (112kms) north-west of Kharkiv, local officials in Okhtyrka said more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in a missile strike on a military base, though there were conflicting accounts of when the attack took place.  In the north, a Russian convoy approaching Kyiv is estimated to have doubled in length – to 4o miles (64km) – since three days ago. The front of the convoy is about 17 miles (25km) from the centre of the Ukrainian capital. US intelligence has warned Russia is attempting to encircle Kyiv.

What has happened since Russia invaded?  On Thursday Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war.  Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase.  Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus.  A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv.  Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles inside Ukraine.  On Friday Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv, and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer.  On Saturday Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the Hostomel airfield.  Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces, including Sumy in the east.  On Sunday an attempted incursion in to Kharkiv was defeated.  On Monday Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people Kharkiv.  Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack.  How did we get here?  Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine.  Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions.  The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded.  The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.  On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and armoured personnel carriers on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia.  What do we know about Russia’s deployments?  Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.  An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion.  Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown.

The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February.  Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations.  How do the militaries compare?  Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland.  What is the historical context?  In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war.  A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement.  Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war.  What is the role of Nord Stream 2?  On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics.  First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.  Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.

On the contrary, my social media feed is filled with posts from Russians opposing the war. “What happened?” they say. “How did we get to this? This is madness!”  People are saying they feel guilty about being Russian. People are burning their passports on camera. Hell, I posted: “I am Russian but Putin is not my president.”  But there are far fewer people actually out protesting. You have to understand that ordinary people in Russia are scared out of their minds. On the first day of the conflict, almost 1,000 protesters were jailed across Russia for walking outside with as little as a piece of paper that said: “I don’t want war.” According to the independent media source OVD-info, in the first four days of the war more than 5,200 people were arrested.  My friend spent time in jail for walking down the same street as the protesters. A professor of sociology, Grigory Yudin, was arrested in the centre of Moscow and reportedly beaten up in the back of an autozak (police bus).  There are now more police teams than I can count – with new names such as Rosgvardiya (Russia’s internal military force) – and they are ruthless. These forces were created several years ago specifically to wander the streets of Moscow (and other cities) and prevent anything “suspicious” from happening.  It doesn’t matter whether you’re an 18-year-old kid or a pregnant middle-aged woman, they’ll beat you up, put you in a wagon and take you in for questioning. When you have a former KGB agent in charge, you have a country that functions as an enormous jail.  It is painfully clear to us that this war is absolutely pointless. Putin is using false history lessons, lamenting the fall of the Soviet Union, and making claims about Nato advancing its forces simply to justify his own madness. I believe that the true answer to the question people ask on social media – “how did we get to this?” – is that Putin is insane.  I don’t know when or why this happened. Maybe it’s his age. Maybe his isolation during the pandemic caused him to question his legacy. I could believe anything now.  When my wife, who is Ukrainian, and I woke up last Thursday in our Dubai hotel room, our whole world had turned upside down. We turned on Putin’s televised address about the military operation. Twenty minutes later, we turned it off. We were scared by the vagueness of his report. What was a “special military operation”? Was this really a declaration of the third world war? We were disgusted by the theatrical performance of a president we had never chosen. We were even more disgusted by the thought that most people in Russia would believe him.  There’s a huge divide of opinions between the “New Russians” – my generation, people born in the 1990s, who never lived in Soviet times – and the older generation. Not one of my friends back home believes that Putin wasn’t planning this war for some time. The older Russians are fed lies by TV and other media to convince them that what Putin is doing is justifiable.  The big problem is that there is no coherent ideology in Russia. There is no shared way of interpreting the world. Instead, the simplistic idea that has become prevalent is a story of “us v them”. It’s extremely easy to sell and it gets votes. That’s the agenda that Putin has been pushing for the past decade or so.  He says that Ukraine is an enemy that is historically part of Russia but sold itself to Nato, or that everyone in the world is the US’s puppet.  These ideas are so contagious. When you try to reason with an average person in Russia, they might say something like: “The TV is right and you’re wrong. Also – you’re probably an agent of the CIA.” Many people live in ever-present fear and it’s easier for them to believe what they’re told. Standing outside the crowd can cost you your freedom.  None of my younger Russian friends around the globe are surprised. We’re so used to feeling disappointed and embarrassed by our government that we barely feel shame any more. Like children of abusive parents, after so many years we forget what’s normal and what’s not. We simply sigh, shake our heads, and say: “Well, what did you expect?” The “global Russians”, as we call ourselves, long ago gave up on the prospect of having a country and government we’d be proud of.  I can’t help but be reminded of the Soviet war with Afghanistan: 15,000 Russian deaths. Nine years of combat. My mother told me stories of her former classmates, people she actually knew, arriving back in coffins. It was a totally pointless endeavour that cost Leonid Brezhnev the entire economy and helped contribute to the Soviet Union’s collapse.  Putin, who is so keen on history, is unknowingly digging his own grave. With Russia cut off from Swift and facing sanctions from the EU, the US, and the UK, it’ll take only a few years before it runs into extremely hard times. And when it does, people will not be afraid any more. If history teaches us anything, it’s that people – even ones as stubborn and patient as the Russians – will not tolerate a lack of food. When the money runs out, so will Putin’s clock.  And we – the new generation of Russians – will be waiting.

On Sunday Vladimir Putin issued a new threat to the west – telling his defense minister and his top military commander to place Russia’s nuclear forces on alert.  It is a new cold war.  The biggest difference between the old cold war and the new one is that authoritarian neo-fascism is no longer just an external threat to America and Europe. A version of it is also growing inside western Europe and the US.  It has even taken over one of America’s major political parties.  The Trump-led Republican party does not openly support Putin, but the Republican party’s animus toward democracy is expressed in ways familiar to Putin and other autocrats.  Trump Republicans continue to refuse to acknowledge the outcome of the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “stolen” from Trump. In many states, on the basis of this big lie, they are making it more difficult for people who don’t share their beliefs to vote.  In several states they are laying the groundwork for ignoring the popular vote altogether and throwing a future presidential election to Trump or another strongman. They have stopped even pretending to be the party of free speech: they are banning books from schools and prohibiting teachers from talking about America’s struggles against racism and homophobia.  Putin’s attack on Ukraine, starting 24 February, and the attack by followers of Donald Trump on the United States Capitol on 6 January 2021 are different, of course, but they resemble one another in their contempt for democratic institutions and their attempts to justify violence by asserting a threat to a dominant racial or ethnic group.  Each also represents the logical culmination of leadership by a dangerous narcissist who flagrantly lies about his intentions and his opponents and who sees the world only in terms of his personal power.  Donald Trump has long admired Vladimir Putin who, evidence shows, personally authorized a secret spy agency operation to support a “mentally unstable” Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. Believing that a Trump White House would help secure Moscow’s strategic objectives, Russia’s spy agencies were ordered to use “all possible force” to ensure Trump’s victory.  Again in the 2020 election, according to a recently unclassified report by the US office of the Director of National Intelligence, Putin authorized “influence operations” aimed at “supporting Trump” and “denigrating President Biden’s candidacy”.  Presumably Putin supported Trump in 2016 and in 2020 in part because of Trump’s disdain for Nato. As president, Trump did all he could to undermine the organization, even suggesting the US should withdraw from it. Is it pure coincidence that once Trump was out of office and Nato remained intact, Putin attacked Ukraine?  Defending democracy and standing up against authoritarian neo-fascism requires courage. In 2019, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, refused Trump’s demand for help in rigging the 2020 election in the United States, even after Trump threatened to withhold money Congress had appropriated to help Ukraine resist Russian expansion.  Today, Zelenskiy won’t be bullied by Putin. He turned down America’s offer to evacuate him, saying: “I need ammunition, not a ride.”  Zelenskiy’s courage in the face of overwhelming brute force has fortified Ukrainians now defending their country against invaders.  Contrast this with the toadies at the Republican National Committee who in February censured Republican representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for participating in Congress’s select committee investigating the events of 6 January, and who called the attack on the Capitol “legitimate political discourse”.  Also contrast Zelenskiy’s courage with most elected Republicans who still refuse to stand up to Trump. On Sunday, on national television, Senator Tom Cotton refused four times to condemn Trump for calling Putin “smart” and “savvy” and Nato and the US “dumb”.  Make no mistake: Putin’s authoritarian neo-fascism has rooted itself in America.  It may be possible to prevent Putin’s aggression from spreading to the rest of Europe. But it is not possible to win a cold civil war inside America without destroying the United States – another of Putin’s objectives when he ordered his spy agencies to help Trump.  In the months and years ahead, those of us in the west who believe in democracy, the rule of law, human rights and truth, must do everything we can to win back our fellow countrymen to these same overriding values.

The first is that Putin does not function within the realm of the usual finely balanced checks and balances, sticks and carrots, that the west hoped would contain him and maintain an uneasy truce in Europe. The second is that decades of work since the second world war to learn from the mistakes of the past and fortify against them in the future have failed. Here again, we have not a civil war, but an invasion of a sovereign state in defiance of the rest of the world. Here again, we have images that are only known to us as historical reels, of frenzy and panic as thousands attempt to flee to safety.  But there is a third realisation that appears to shape the perception of too many western journalists justifiably appalled at the defiling of Europe. From the tone of much coverage, this seems uniquely distressing and more alarming to them because the lives of non-Europeans have less value, and their conflicts are contained, far away from us.  I thought it was just clumsy phrasing from a couple of reporters under pressure, but soon it became clear that it was, in fact, a media-wide tic. From Al Jazeera to CBS News, journalists were appalled that this was not happening in “Iraq or Afghanistan” but in a “relatively civilised European city”. One said: “The unthinkable has happened. This is not a developing, third world nation. This is Europe.” Another reflected: “These are prosperous middle-class people … these are not obviously refugees getting away from the Middle East. To put it bluntly, these are not refugees from Syria, these are refugees from Ukraine … They’re Christian, they’re white, they’re very similar.”  Ukraine’s former deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, told the BBC, unchallenged: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed.”  Daniel Hannan, Telegraph columnist, former MEP, Lord Hannan of Kingsclere; put it more bluntly, writing that those suffering in Ukraine “seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking … War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations. It can happen to anyone.” It is, he said: “civilisation in retreat”.  This strange account of a history in which wars, conflict and dispossession mostly happened in “third world” and “remote” countries (remote from whom?) is a fiction that has come about as a result of a political and media climate that has stripped the humanity of those seeking refuge so completely it has become a fact, repeated with no self-awareness or shame.  An extremely generous view of these statements is that it is not, in itself, an unusual impulse to care more about, or be affected more, by events happening closer to home than farther afield. Perhaps what these people are really trying to say is something along the lines of “this has not happened in this patch in generations” in order to highlight the abnormality of this particular conflict. There is that.  But there is also much more to it. There is an acceptance that war is natural in other places but an aberration here. That war happens only to the poor and the uncivilised, not the well-off and stable. That the fates of refuge and uprootedness are the lot of others, and therefore less of an event.  These are beliefs that fall apart under the slightest of scrutiny to reveal a worldview warped by what has for too long been a popular, unchallenged discourse on refugees and asylum seekers. These opinions were shaped, concertedly and over time, in order to justify inhumane and often violent policies passed to block people from entering European lands. For these policies to become accepted, their victims had to be portrayed as threatening and undeserving.  The legacy of that is a western world hostile to all those in need, blue-eyed or not. As ever, when we avert our eyes from the humanity of one group of people, we end up building immigration systems that assail the humanity of all. A border of policies as high as the heavens now meets Ukrainians seeking to enter the UK, even as family members.  As the Ukrainian flag was projected on to Downing Street, the Home Office was hoisting up the drawbridge, posting on its website: “Ukrainian nationals in Ukraine (who aren’t immediate family members of British nationals normally living in Ukraine, or where the British national is living in the UK), are currently unable to make visa applications to visit, work, study or join family in the UK.” After a barrage of criticism, the government promised to ease these visa rules, allowing the grandparents, adult children, siblings and adult parents of Ukrainians who are settled in the UK to apply for visas under the scheme. Even those visa applications that are allowed will have to navigate an obstacle course of paperwork in the middle of war.  Exceptionalism means we are doomed to repeat the complacencies of the past, constantly comforting ourselves that it can’t happen here, because it only happens elsewhere to others whose pain is somehow different from ours.  But their wars are no less unthinkable, their uprootedness no less traumatic, their civilisation no less valid, than the thousands now leaving Ukraine. And in designing a world in which we are sanguine about other people’s war, we have ensured that we cannot anticipate when war will happen on our doorstep – and that when it does, we are appalled, but then find our humanitarian response systems hobbled, calcified in cruelty.

The State Emergency Service issued an evacuation order for the town centre on Tuesday afternoon, directing people there to leave by no later than 7pm.  The Ballina Hospital was being evacuated due to the rising flood waters. NSW Ambulance and the SES temporarily relocated 55 patients to Xavier Catholic College where a makeshift emergency facility has been set up.  Flood waters from the Richmond River were expected to peak in Ballina on Tuesday night, coinciding with high tide.  The town has been on high alert since Sunday, eyeing flood waters from the saturated Wilsons River catchment, which peaked at 14.4 metres at Lismore on Monday, and Richmond river catchment, which has caused major flooding at Coraki, Bungawalbyn and Woodburn on Tuesday.  Some houses in West Ballina were flooded on Tuesday, but the waters swiftly receded. They are expected to build again to coincide with a 1.3 metre high tide on Tuesday night and a 1.8 metre king tide on Wednesday morning.  Authorities are predicting a one-in-500-year flood.  Upstream at Lismore, the flood waters have damaged hundreds of homes and businesses and are not expected to fully drain for several days, because water will have to be pumped out of areas surrounded by the flood levee.  It’s not known how many people remain stranded, and police have confirmed the body of an elderly woman was discovered by a concerned neighbour at a Lismore home on Tuesday morning.  The SES conducted at least 230 rescues in the northern rivers area on Tuesday. Power and telephone access has been cut, with high flood waters hampering repair efforts.  Water was lapping at the doorsteps of shopfronts in Ballina late on Tuesday morning as NSW police urged residents to stay out of the central business district.  The SES issued an evacuation order for South Ballina and low-lying areas of Ballina in the early hours of Tuesday. By 7am it said it was too late to move people away from the town and instead the SES advised people in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.  In North Ballina the canal has broken its banks, threatening homes and businesses and cutting off residents.  I am spending the morning evacuating in Ballina. Here’s Tamar St at king tide with the council chambers on the right pic.twitter.com/2eiciBKqX4 — Tessa Flemming (@tessa_flemming) February 28, 2022  “Rising flood water is beginning to make it unsafe to evacuate the area,” the SES said on Tuesday morning.  “Burns Point Ferry is closed and Wardell Bridge is inundated. You should immediately move to the highest safe place now, such as higher ground or inside a sturdy multi-storey building to upper levels as high above water levels as possible. Do not leave your location unless it is safe to do so.”  People were warned to take their pets, warm clothes, any medication they need, and insurance documents and move to the highest place in their area if safe to do so, and to keep moving as the water rises.  The emergency services agency warned that residents may be trapped without power, water, or other essential services, and “it may be too dangerous for NSW SES to rescue you”.  The NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, said: “We must prepare for the possibility that lives have been lost. While I would love to think, and I truly hope, that we will not see any deaths from this event, I think that it is unrealistic that a disaster of this magnitude will mean that there are no lives lost.”  She urged residents across Sydney and the NSW south coast to prepare for a possible evacuation order as the low moved downwards.  At Grafton, the Clarence River peaked at 7.66 metres.

On Monday Ballina was used as a base for rescue efforts for Lismore, 40km upstream, where the Wilsons River peaked at 14.4 metres – the worst on record for the northern rivers town.  The water broke over Lismore’s flood levee on Monday morning. It was higher than levels recorded in both 1974 and 1954, and is not expected to drop below major flood levels – 9.7 metres – until midday Tuesday.  Rescues continue in Lismore  More than 4,000 people were rescued by emergency services or neighbours in the area on Monday and overnight, according to Lismore’s mayor, Steve Krieg, but many people remained isolated on Tuesday morning.  Krieg told Channel Seven on Tuesday morning that nine people were still unaccounted for and 400 people were waiting to be rescued.  “The police have launched their boats to go out and start that, we also have three army helicopters in the area assisting with winch rescues, so our number one priority today is to make sure every citizen is accounted for, safe and well,” he said.  “I know there was 4,000 rescues performed yesterday by emergency service and civilians which is an incredible community effort – we’ll leave the rescues to the professionals today.”  Up to 50 people and livestock were rescued after they were stuck on a bridge in Woodburn overnight, with thousands more homes expected to be affected. The Richmond River was at 6.3 metres and rising when they were evacuated.  Dozens of people have spent the night stranded on the Woodburn bridge with their cars and horses.

In Ballina, the SES has said up to 7,000 homes could be inundated. The Ballina shire council mayor, Sharon Cadwallader, told the ABC the town was expecting a one-in-500-year flood.  “The water will move slowly, but all predictions, all flood modelling that staff have done, we are facing a one-in-500-year flood and that is a serious situation for Ballina,” she said.

He said there had been 6,000 calls for assistance across the state.  “To all people, particularly across the east coast of our state, these issues may come your way,” he said. “So if those evacuation orders are made, if those evacuation warnings are made, we need to get ready, we need to work together to get through this as a state.”  Dean Narramore, a Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist, said it would be a “wet couple of days” in all of metropolitan Sydney, with minor to moderate flooding possible.  More than a dozen flood warnings were in place across the state, with record flooding at Wilsons River at Lismore and new flood records set along the Tweed River.  The river peaked at 6.51 metres at North Murwillumbah, 4.8 metres at Tumbulgum and 2.95 metres at Chinderah.  At Grafton, the Clarence River peaked at 7.66 metres, just below the levee height of 7.95 metres. Flood waters were peaking at Ulmarra at around 6 metres while Maclean was peaking at about 3.3 metres, near the town levee level.

Although Democrats expected the bill to fail, they brought the measure forward at a perilous moment for abortion rights, to ensure votes were recorded.  The supreme court is expected in June to decide a Mississippi case which could severely curtail or gut abortion rights nationally.  On Monday, Democrats were 14 votes shy of the 60 needed to bring the bill to the floor for debate. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, was the only Democrat to join Republicans.  “Abortion is a fundamental right and women’s decisions over women’s healthcare belong to women, not to extremist rightwing legislators,” the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters.  “Every American deserves to know where their senator stands on an issue as important as the right to choose.”  In 1973, the supreme court invalidated dozens of state abortion bans in its landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which found a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Since then, Roe has protected women’s right to abort a pregnancy to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally regarded as 22 to 24 weeks gestation.  The bill brought before the Senate on Monday, the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), would codify the rights provided by Roe in federal law. Last September, it was passed by the Democrat-controlled House.  “Tonight we voted in the Senate to say that Roe v Wade is the law of the land,” said Patty Murray of Washington state, a lead sponsor of the bill, after it failed.  “Democrats stood up and said women should make their own healthcare decisions. We trust women. We trust patients. We trust their doctors.”  In oral arguments in the Mississippi case, justices showed an interest in undermining or overturning Roe. If the conservative majority were to reverse Roe, abortion would effectively become a state issue. In that scenario, 26 states are expected to ban abortion immediately or as quickly as possible.  The 6-3 conservative court has already permitted severe restrictions in Texas, which it allowed to enact a ban at six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant.  The WHPA would codify a right American women have had for generations and block medically unnecessary restrictions. That would undo hundreds of laws passed by right-leaning states that have sought to make abortion more expensive and difficult to obtain, often without any medical benefit to women.  Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, called the WHPA “extreme”, adding: “It’s an egregious violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, and that is the right to life.”  Young women, poor women and women of color disproportionately seek abortion. Abortion bans would fall heavily on such populations, forcing millions to travel hundreds of miles to seek abortion and leaving others with few options except clandestine providers or unwanted pregnancy.

Among them is extreme heat, a crisis that on average already claims more American lives than hurricanes and tornadoes combined.  Though the impact is already being felt, heatwaves are largely silent killers. Often, the toll is tallied far into the aftermath of an event and is vastly undercounted. Unlike fires and floods that produce immediate and visible destruction, heat’s harmful effects can seem more subtle – even if they are in fact more deadly.  “People don’t think of heat as a hazard,” says Kristie Ebi, a professor in the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. But in the Pacific north-west, where Ebi lives, for example, unprecedented temperatures baked the region last year, bewildering residents used to moderate, often lukewarm, summers.  Policymakers and environmentalists are looking for better ways to close the gap in the public’s perception of the risks, especially in the American west where landscapes are rapidly warming.  Some are pushing for new ranking systems to help elevate awareness around the issue or assign heatwaves names, much like federal agencies do for hurricanes.  “We need a shock to the system,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, the senior vice-president and director of the Adrienne Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. The organization, which focuses on policy solutions to the climate crisis, has advocated heatwave naming along with number categories as a way to add urgency to the growing disasters.  “If you go into the hospital now and are suffering from heat they will say you have kidney failure or heart failure” she says. “There are so many areas now we need to culturally shift that context of heat.”  The group advised California on new legislation introduced last year, which would make it the first state to implement a naming and ranking system like the organizational system for categorizing storms dating back in the 1800s. Athens, Greece and Seville, Spain will roll out similar programs later this year.  A sign at Zabriskie Point in Death Valley warns hikers of the risk of heat. Photograph: Bridget Bennet/Reuters  Advocates of the program believe assigning a name to a disaster will help people engage with it. “It becomes an identity and a brand is built,” Baughman McLeod said, adding that it also helps for archival purposes. “We all remember what happened during Hurricane Sandy. I know what a Category 3 is and I know when it has a name it has reached a certain threshold and I need to pay attention and act.”  Still, the science isn’t clear on whether a name would do much to communicate heightened dangers in the most effective way. “The National Weather Service is not aware of any research or evidence that suggests naming heatwaves would raise awareness about heat-related risks” said Kimberly McMahon, a NWS Public Weather Services program manager. But early warning systems, with or without associated names play an important part, she said. “Even knowing the potential for a heat event or abnormally hot summer can allow preparations to occur further in advance.”  Naming, too, can have its problems. A study published in 2014 found that Americans don’t adequately assess the risks when hurricanes are given female names. More than just a hallmark of misogyny, the researchers found this actually cost lives. On average deaths were more than 95% higher during female-named hurricanes than those assigned male names.  Naming aside, the two bills in California also outline the creation of an interagency heat taskforce, an extreme heat advisory council, and will open a new chief heat officer role to oversee planning and preparation. The pieces of legislation, if they pass, would initiate statewide advance warning and ranking by the start of 2024 and would establish the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program to coordinate state efforts and coordinate with local and regional officials.  Ebi says that coordination between agencies – that include local, state, and federal programs – will be key. “There are lots of opportunities to facilitate the information transfer so that as people develop these systems they don’t start from the very beginning” she said, noting that a variety of stakeholders should be brought to the table. “On the one hand the projections are dire,” Ebi says. “But on the other, we have an enormous basket of options for what can be done to protect people who are at higher risk during a heatwave.”  Several municipalities across the west and governments across the globe are already adopting heat programs and plans. At the federal level, The National Integrated Heat Health Information Systems and White House Extreme Heat Interagency Working Group are collaborating to expand messaging about extreme heat and offering up lessons learned.  Phoenix, which is at the top of the list of rapidly heating cities, hired scientist and heat expert David Hondula to head its new Office of Heat Response and Mitigation in September last year, becoming the first city to launch a publicly-funded position of this kind. Miami, Florida also brought on a chief heat officer, as did Athens, Greece and Freetown in Sierra Leone.  There’s still a difficult path ahead, but according to Ebi, planning will go a long way.  “All heat-related deaths are preventable,” she said. “We have a real opportunity to improve lives today even if the climate continues to change.”

Abe, who presided over record defence budgets before resigning in 2020, said Japan should cast off taboos surrounding its possession of nuclear weapons following the outbreak of war in Europe.  “In Nato, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy take part in nuclear sharing, hosting American nuclear weapons,” Abe said in a TV interview, according to Nikkei Asia. “We need to understand how security is maintained around the world and not consider it taboo to have an open discussion.  “We should firmly consider various options when we talk about how we can protect Japan and the lives of its people in this reality.”  Japan, the only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is part of the US nuclear umbrella but has for decade adhered to the three non-nuclear principles – that it will not produce or possess nuclear weapons or allow them on its territory.  Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, quickly rejected Abe’s call for a debate on the nuclear-sharing option. “It is unacceptable given our country’s stance of maintaining the three non-nuclear principles,” Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, told MPs this week.  Wang Wenbin, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing: “Japanese politicians have frequently spread fallacies related to Taiwan and even blatantly made false remarks that violate the nation’s three non-nuclear principles.  “We strongly ask Japan to deeply reflect on its history”, Wang added, and warned Tokyo to “be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue to stop provoking trouble”.  Under Abe, a conservative whose lifelong political ambition is to revise Japan’s “pacifist” constitution, said any conflict involving China and Taiwan would also constitute an emergency for Japan.  He called on the US to end its “ambiguity” on the defence of Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, noting that the island is just 110 km from Yonaguni, Japan’s westernmost inhabited island.  “The US takes a strategy of ambiguity, meaning it may or may not intervene militarily if Taiwan is attacked,” Abe said. “By showing it may intervene, it keeps China in check, but by leaving open the possibility that it may not intervene, it makes sure that the Taiwanese forces for independence do not get out of control.”  Abe, leader of the biggest faction in Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party, has made several hawkish interventions on security policy that enjoy support inside the party but could provoke a backlash among voters nervous about Japan’s potential involvement in regional conflicts.  China’s state-run tabloid Global Times accused Abe of attempting to “unlock” Japanese militarism. “It is not only ironic, but also a huge real risk, that a group of people in the only country in the world that was bombed by atomic bombs would call for an invitation to the culprit to deploy nuclear weapons in their own territory,” it said in an editorial.

The prime-time address comes at a precarious moment for Biden and the world. Speaking in the House chamber, Biden will interrupt harrowing coverage of combat in a European capital, as evidence builds that Russian attacks are striking civilian areas and Russian president, Vladimir Putin, threatens nuclear war.  It is a starkly different backdrop than White House officials had anticipated when they began drafting the speech, which typically draws millions of viewers.  “There’s no question that this speech is a little different than it would have been just a few months ago,” White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters on Monday.  Finalized between situation room meetings and calls with allies, Biden will attempt to deliver an address that balances the crisis with domestic challenges that polling shows are most important to American voters, such as the economy, inflation and a stalled domestic agenda. He has already warned that sanctions on Russia could cause oil prices to rise further. US inflation is already at its highest in decades.  The president, Psaki said, would use the opportunity to emphasize American leadership and to lay out his efforts to “rally the world to stand up for democracy and against Russian aggression.”  The speech, and all the pomp and circumstance that surrounds it, arrives as Biden’s approval rating falls to new lows, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. Just 37% said they approved of the job he was doing, with a majority of independents rating him negatively. Underscoring the headwinds facing Democrats ahead of the midterm elections, 50% of Americans said they wanted Republicans in charge of Congress. Just 40% preferred Democrats to remain in control.  In a preview of the speech, White House officials said Biden would tout his administration’s progress on the pandemic, the economic recovery and a pair of early legislative successes: a $1.9tn stimulus package and the bipartisan infrastructure law.  They said Biden would acknowledge the financial hardships facing many American families, while attempting to shift the narrative around the country’s economic trajectory from one of pessimism to progress.  Pointing to low unemployment and job growth, Biden will credit his economic policies with helping to usher in a rapid recovery, while calling for Congress to enact new measures designed to lower the costs of child care, healthcare and prescription drugs. The ideas represent some of the most popular parts of Biden’s sweeping domestic policy bill, known as Build Back Better, that is languishing before the Senate.  “The president is proud of the administration’s progress to date,” a senior administration official told reporters in a preview of his remarks. “We all look forward to building on this progress by easing price pressures and extending the historic labor market recovery in the months ahead.”  He is expected to directly address rising inflation, which is increasingly a top priority for voters and one of Republicans’ most potent attacks on Democrats.  Biden will also take the opportunity to tout his nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. If confirmed by the evenly-divided Senate, she will be the first Black woman on the court, fulfilling a pledge Biden made during the most difficult days of his campaign for the Democratic nomination.  Security is always high during the State of the Union, which brings political leaders under one roof. Capitol police have installed an “inner-perimeter fence”, evoking the tense days following the January 6 assault. For a three-hour window, flights will be restricted around Washington.  The Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, was chosen to deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden, an opportunity often awarded to a rising star. The first woman to govern Iowa, Reynolds gained national attention for bucking Covid-19 policies championed by Biden.  The Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, will also offer a response on behalf of the progressive Working Families Party. She is expected to call on Democrats to restart negotiations over Biden’s domestic spending bill, which includes poverty-reducing, economic and climate policies that are a priority for many progressives.  All 535 members of Congress were invited to attend the speech and will be seated on the floor and in the gallery. Guests are not allowed and full vaccination is “strongly recommended” but not required.  Ahead of the speech, the Congress physician announced that masks were now optional in the Capitol, including in the House chamber during the State of the Union. The decision will help underscore the message Biden hopes to deliver: that the US is moving beyond the pandemic.  The rule-change may also have averted a possible showdown with Republican lawmakers who have refused to comply with a mask mandate, incurring tens of thousands of dollars in fines. Still, the address comes as relations between parties have become increasingly toxic.  And the crisis in Ukraine has done little to ease the seething partisanship at home. Republicans have hammered the president over his handling of the pandemic and the economy as well as his response to Ukraine, which some have argued as too little too late.  Yet their criticism of Biden’s foreign policy leadership is complicated by the party’s embrace of Trump, who praised and flattered Putin even after Russia’s invasion.

Scientists have uncovered startling declines in their populations , with the United Nations estimating that half a million species could be lost by the midpoint of this century.  In writing about this silent unfolding disaster for my new book, The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires that Run the World, I explored how the loss of insects imperils our food security, potentially deprives us of new medicines and degrades the ecosystems we all rely upon to sustain life. Through habitat loss, pesticide use and climate change, we are creating a version of hell for our greatest allies on this planet.  But there is another reason to care about the insect crisis – their astonishing characteristics and abilities. Some seem otherworldly – such as the butterfly that has an eye on the tip of its penis.  “Each insect is like an alien life form with a detailed life history that often is so bizarre, you couldn’t create it as fiction if you wanted to,” as Michelle Trautwein, an entomologist at the California Academy of Sciences, told me.  Here are 10 of the most interesting things I found out about them.  Bees can do almost everything  Stingless bees congregate around their hive at an apiary in Pekan Bada, Aceh province, Indonesia. Photograph: Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images    Most of us are aware of the crucial pollination role that bees play in ensuring a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables. But researchers have uncovered an array of abilities in bees that may cause some surprise.  Honeybees understand the concept of zero, can add and subtract numbers and can even be trained to detect land mines more effectively than sniffer dogs. Their pollination services have become so valuable in the US that there is a growing criminal operation among “bee rustlers” to steal beehives in California’s farming heartland.  Some bumblebees, meanwhile, are able to fly at an altitude of 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level (a height just shy of Mount Kilimanjaro’s summit), can be taught to play soccer and remember good and bad experiences, suggesting they have a form of consciousness.  All of this is energy-intensive work. If a human male devoured a Mars bar, he’d burn the energy off in around an hour; a bumblebee of an equivalent size would use the same energy in just 30 seconds.  Beetles have the abilities of tiny superheroes  The carrion beetle Nicrophorus investigator. Photograph: HHelene/Getty Images/iStockphoto  The world is awash with not rats, sheep or even humans, but beetles – around 350,000 species and counting. Some have adapted to humanity’s altering of the world, such as the weevils that feast on our grain.  Others are noteworthy in their own right. A horned dung beetle is so strong that if it were a human, it would be able to hold aloft six double-decker buses. Another type of beetle, a water beetle called Regimbartia attenuata, can even survive being eaten by a frog by swimming through the amphibian’s stomach and crawling out of its bottom.  There are people who will strongly defend mosquitoes  Mosquitoes are not just agents of suffering. Photograph: doug4537/Getty Images  Mosquitoes are usually viewed as either an annoyance or a deadly menace. Indeed, there are fears that the threat of malaria and dengue will spread as we continue to heat up the world to mosquitoes’ liking.  But some entomologists have warm feelings towards mosquitoes, pointing to their pollination of certain flowers and their little-known environmental work, where they help cycle nutrients through soils and plants and provide food for animals higher up in the food chain, such as frogs and birds. Wiping out all mosquitoes would cause a cascade of detrimental impacts.  Cockroaches are hated – but impressive  If cockroaches had a theme song, it might be Donna Summer’s I Will Survive. Photograph: Smith Chetanachan/Alamy  The only insects that rival mosquitoes in our displeasure are cockroaches. There are thousands of species of cockroach found in forests but we tend to focus on the two – American and German – that have adapted themselves to our homes.  Objectively, these creatures are marvels. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the cockroach can crash into walls at high speed with no loss of momentum before scaling vertically. These great survivors can fit into cracks as thin as a small coin, bite with a force 50 times their body weight, and survive for two weeks after being beheaded.  Insects have shaped human history  A fruit fly played a key role in enabling space travel. Photograph: Tacio Philip Sansonovski/Alamy  Insects may not be celebrated like horses, tigers or dolphins, but they have played interesting cameo roles in our own history.  The common marsh mosquito was called the “founding mother” of the United States by one historian due to the malaria that ravaged the British army and helped force its surrender during the American Revolution. A century later, the emergence of modern beehive boxes unlocked the productivity of farmland and revolutionized agriculture.  What would you think the first animal in space was? A monkey? A dog or cat, perhaps? It was, in fact, a fruit fly that was propelled beyond the atmosphere in a US military rocket in 1947 to ascertain the potential impact of cosmic radiation on astronauts.  Moths are unfairly maligned  This massive giant wood moth was found by construction workers building a school in Queensland, Australia. Photograph: Mount Cotton State School/Facebook  Moths are often slandered as powdery vandals that enjoy chomping their way through the clothes in our wardrobes. This is largely unfair - it’s the moth larvae, not adults, that feed on clothes, and even then only a couple out of the thousands of moth species do this.  Behold, instead, the Hercules moth of northern Australia. The world’s largest moth, the species has a wingspan as wide as a dinner plate but no mouth - it lives off the food reserves gobbled up while a bulky caterpillar - and two false eyes in its rear to confuse would-be predators.  We should think more highly of wasps  A paper wasp builds a honeycomb shaped paper nest, in Montlouis-sur-Loire, Center France. Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images  Wasps aren’t just the pillagers of bucolic picnics. They are also important pollinators of plants and predators of the pests that chew through our most valued flowers and crops.  Research has additionally found that paper wasps can grasp transitive inference, a logical arrangement whereby if A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, then A must be greater than C. These wasps can also recognize other individual wasps by looking at their faces.  The production of chocolate and ice cream depends on insects  The next time you satisfy a chocolate craving, thank a species of tiny fly. Photograph: tyncho/Getty Images/iStockphoto  Enjoy chocolate? Be thankful, then, for the tiny midge that pollinates the cacao plant. Want a world with ice cream in it? Then you’ll want the pollinators that ensure dairy-producing cows have enough alfalfa to eat.  Crickets may become the food of the future  A man taste-tests baked Orthoptera crickets at the cricket farm of the Kyrgyz entrepreneur Adyl Gaparov in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Photograph: Igor Kovalenko/EPA  Insects have been on the menu for societies across Asia, Africa and South America for generations but are still viewed with unease by many western diners. That may change as the ruinous environmental impact of meat eating prompts some to switch to insects such as crickets, which can be farmed in huge numbers with little resulting pollution.  Crickets can be seasoned with chili; ants can be dipped in lemon. These are high protein snacks that could alter our relationship and appreciation of insects in general.  People will show a fondness for insects in unusual ways  Winston Churchill’s butterfly collection helped ease his depression. Walter Rothschild, scion of the banking family, enjoyed dressing fleas in costumes. People across North America plant milkweed to aid monarch butterflies. Giant burrowing cockroaches are doted on as pets in Australia.  It’s lazy to dismiss insects as pests or irrelevances. Many of us see how precious they are to our world. That feeling will need to be multiplied, and harnessed, if we are to stem the greatest crisis they’ve ever faced.  The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires that Run the World, is out now in the US

This is why people can feel angry when history is reinterpreted or retold in ways that make them feel uncomfortable. And yet that is not always a bad thing, since so many comforting views of the past are deeply flawed. History should not just exist to serve the present, but to challenge it, too.  This has all been particularly evident in Wales. In the 19th century, English observers were often struck by the Welsh obsession with the past. Matthew Arnold, a Victorian professor of poetry at Oxford, claimed that everywhere in Wales had its own traditions, and that the Welsh people knew and clung to this living past. History gave the Welsh dignity. It provided them with tales of times when the Welsh were self-governing or rose up against their chains of servitude. It was a refuge from an economic and political system that rarely favoured them and a challenge to those who belittled them.  But the past was also problematic for the Welsh. Although the tales of medieval princes could inspire, they were, ultimately, tales of defeat. Wales lost its independence. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, its last recognised prince, ended up with his head on a London spike. More than a century later, the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr returned some dignity to the Welsh people and he planned something resembling a Welsh state, with universities and its own parliament. Yet his dreams came to nothing and his rebellion was crushed by English military might. He was never captured, which gave him a romantic halo, but his tale remained one with an unhappy ending.  Such stories from the past complicated relations with the English. In the middle of the 19th century, Henry Richard, who would later become an influential Liberal MP, wrote that in Wales, “a fierce and vindictive patriotism” was “constantly fed by stories, half fact and half fable, transmitted from father to son, of the cruelty and perfidy of their Saxon and Norman oppressors, and of the victories and defeats which had marked their long struggle for independence”.  Welsh rebel leader Owain Glyndŵr. Photograph: Lordprice Collection/Alamy  History became more important as the Welsh language, the most potent symbol of Welsh identity and difference to England, weakened. Wales became a modern industrial nation in the 19th century, but greater contact with the wider world came at a linguistic cost. The Welsh language slipped into a precarious minority position. In the 20th century, English became more familiar through education, railways and the mass media. The future of Welsh was further imperilled through homes being turned into holiday cottages and the young moving away in search of work. If the language was Wales, as many believed, then the nation itself seemed to be in danger of dying. In this context, history gained a new function. It provided some solace through the idea that the Welsh were, in the words of Dafydd Iwan’s famous song, “yma o hyd, er gwaetha pawb a phopeth” (“still here, despite everyone and everything”).  But new concerns emerged in the 20th century about whether Wales’s history was well known enough. Calls for Welsh history to be taught more in schools date back more than a century, but recently they have become increasingly angry. Despite devolution, Wales is still not at the heart of most pupil’s history education. There is a belief that if people knew more about how Wales had fought for its freedom in the past, they would do so again.  Over the last century, some nationalists have certainly tried to use history to fuel national sentiment. Given how the Welsh have voted for the past century, it is reasonable to argue they have remained part of the United Kingdom through choice rather than through coercion. But, no matter how often historians point to the nuances of the past, popular understandings or tellings of Welsh history have often slipped into an accumulation of wrongs endured.  It is difficult not to wonder sometimes if people actually do want more Welsh history taught, rather than just their narrow version of it. It is difficult not to worry how a history based on grievance shapes the sense of belonging of the hundreds of thousands who have moved from England to Wales, and how it might shape the political decisions we make about our shared future as citizens of this small country.  Nonetheless, there have been times when Wales has been badly treated and let down by rule from England. Perhaps more damaging than dismissive and patronising attitudes to the Welsh language and Welsh people has been central government’s marginalisation of the Welsh economy. As the days of heavy industry drew to an end, little substantive was done to revive the fortunes of communities built around mines, metalworks or quarries that no longer existed. Many in Wales are much happier hearing about these slights than the more nuanced picture of the past painted by historians.  The defensiveness and anxiety that interpretations of the past can generate shows how emotional history can be, and how Welsh and British identity are sometimes trapped by their pasts. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s 2015 novel The Buried Giant, a magical mist of forgetfulness has been cast on the Britons and Saxons to ensure neither remembers the wrongs and atrocities committed by each against the other. This ensures old grievances do not fester and the two peoples can live side by side. It is a powerful parable about the dangers of remembering, but also people’s desire to do just that.  Whether Wales remains in the UK or not, geography means its most important external relationship will always be with England. It is much easier to accept this if it is remembered that the two nations have not always been at loggerheads. Indeed, Wales has often benefited from its relationship with England, whether through trade, the welfare state, fiscal transfers or international security. Recognising all this might move any campaign for Welsh independence away from the xenophobia that too often marked Brexit. It might also help ensure that any decision on Wales’ status is based on the needs of the future and not whatever did or did not happen in the past.  Prof Martin Johnes is a historian of Wales, sport, politics and popular culture at Swansea University  ‘My definition of folk music: music that can, and will, be changed’  I am a Welsh folk musician, and to be a folk musician means to be constantly in collaboration and conflict with your history, or, as it’s more commonly known, “the tradition”. Musicians everywhere face choices as to whether to embrace, subvert or reject the tradition, but they will always be in a relationship with it. As a Welsh folk musician, the tradition within which I exist is defined by melodies, songs and instruments being passed down through the generations, unchanging. The story I am told usually focuses on the things that have stayed the same, the things that will always and forever make Welsh folk music Welsh.  But I believe the story of Welsh folk music could be told the opposite way: as a story of change, of new influences and ideas being brought in by people from other places, and a story of new struggles and challenges that will inevitably enact changes over the centuries. My definition of folk music: music that can, and will, be changed.  I have been playing the harp since I was eight. I started learning on the Celtic harp, before moving on to the triple harp, which has three rather than one row of strings, removing the need for levers or pedals to play chromatic notes. It originated in Italy as a baroque instrument, before arriving in London in the 17th century and being adopted by Welsh Londoners, soon becoming known as the Welsh harp. I’m lucky enough to be one of a tiny group of young people in Wales, and the world, who play this instrument today.  Cerys Hafana playing the triple harp. Photograph: Avi Allen  My first harp teacher’s house is a museum that also happens to be a home. It is exactly where you want to go to receive a thorough education in the history of Welsh folk music. You are surrounded by artefacts, manuscripts and instruments that are kept warm and loved, and which in other less careful hands may have found themselves gathering dust. My first harp teacher is a gatherer, a protector, a collector. She takes this job seriously. It is her lifeblood, her passion, but the responsibility weighs heavily on her shoulders.  She can often be found shaking her head and wringing her hands, aghast at the young people today who show no interest in their history or their music. Most of those who have taken on the role of protecting and preserving the tradition have an overwhelmingly pessimistic outlook on the future of Welsh folk music: these young people just don’t get it. They don’t care. They have no respect for history and tradition, no understanding of where they come from, and are changing Welsh folk music beyond recognition.  One of my formative experiences in folk music was attending an annual week-long course for young people at an outdoor education centre in north Wales. Before I arrived the first time, harp in tow, I was very much under the impression that I was the only young Welsh folk musician left in Wales. So what I found came as a bit of a rude awakening. There were about 50 other teenagers filling every corner of the centre with jigs and reels, singing folk songs in improvised four-part harmony until 3am. I spent most of my first visit hiding on the top bunk in my room, but over the years I began to feel more and more at home in this noisy, frenetic community of passionate young musicians.  This other tradition has a very different approach. Tunes are there to be used and abused. The musical points of reference come from far and wide, with jazz perhaps the most obvious external influence. I am now a member of the Youth Folk Ensemble of Wales, a continuation of the course, and though the majority of melodies and songs we use are Welsh, we have arrangements inspired by eastern European turbo folk and Daft Punk.  For a while, at these events, I felt as though I’d found “my people”. It was a breath of fresh air to me, as a young queer person with no friends at school, to be surrounded by such open-minded, enthusiastic and welcoming people. And then one night, while a group of us were sitting around playing games, the clock struck midnight and someone gleefully declared: “Right! It’s past midnight, which means we can now be as homophobic and racist as we like!” and proceeded to play a game involving guessing who in the room was most likely to be gay.  One key event in the Welsh folk calendar is the Mari Lwyd – a traditionally south-Walian celebration of the new year which, in short, involves a pub crawl with a horse’s skull on a stick. But the village of Dinas Mawddwy in Snowdonia in north Wales plays host to a Mari Lwyd that, despite being relatively recently established, pays its respects to much more traditional aspects of Welsh folk culture, perhaps most notably folk dancing, which takes place on the street, led by a group of dancers in authentic Welsh costumes. Everyone, regardless of age, nationality and language will come out, wait for the accordions and fiddles to start up, and be organised into pairs by the more seasoned dancers.  It is, however, incredibly important that these pairs are all man and woman. This is often checked a few times before starting a dance, to make sure everyone is following this sacred rule. And every time we change partner, I get asked the same question: “Are you a man or a woman?!” I try to answer with whichever I think I’m supposed to be in the dance, to minimise confusion. This may be a reinvented tradition, and it may involve a horse’s head on a stick and a man in drag, but heteronormativity and the gender binary are apparently two traditions that must be protected and respected at all costs.  Mari Lwyd celebrations in south Wales in 2018. Photograph: Jessica Gwynne/Alamy  I have a theory that the triple harp is seen by many as a symbol of Wales, its plight mirroring that of Wales and the Welsh language in the last century. Many influential players today came to the instrument as adults with a passion for Welsh history, and saw learning it as the ultimate manifestation of their interests. It is viewed as a kind of historical artefact, hailing from a better time when everyone in Wales spoke Welsh (and was born in Wales), when every young person was passionate about their native culture, and when rich landowners made their servants work in national dress in the name of preserving the tradition.  But when people imply that things were better for Wales back then, I can’t help but suspect that what that really means is that things were better for the Wales of rich white men. It’s an erasure of all the things that have changed for the better. And it’s an erasure of all the kinds of people who weren’t around, or weren’t able to participate then, but who have so much to offer now. Where do we draw the line between preserving tradition and excluding people who aren’t considered “traditional”?  Cerys Hafana is a triple harpist, pianist and composer from mid-Wales  ‘The first time I saw that sign I remember thinking: who is that boy?’  It’s Saturday 14 October 2017 and I’m back in Swansea. It’s evening and I’m staring up at the sign outside a pub in the Killay area of the city. The pub is very familiar, but the sign is not. It’s nondescript, in stark contrast to the sign that hung there years before. I can still picture the old one: a portrait of a young boy with dark brown skin. His head is turned to the right; his eyes look into the distance. White teeth are visible; he might be smiling. He wears a bright pink shirt with a mandarin collar, and a matching turban. It is large, pleated and decorated with pearls. In the centre of the turban there is an oval jewel set in gold, and a yellow feather. A painted ornate livery surrounds the portrait. Whitbread is painted in white letters above the image. Beneath, The Black Boy.  The first time I saw that sign I was sitting in my dad’s blue Mini in the car park. I remember wondering: who is that boy? Did he used to live here? Was he black in the sense of being African, as the name and his face suggested? Or Indian, as his clothes suggested? What was his connection to the area? The “ugly, lovely town” of Dylan Thomas’s childhood was a city by the time I was born there. Killay, once a mining village, was now a suburb. We moved there from nearby Fforestfach in 1977 and lived there until the summer of 1982. But that sign no longer hangs outside the Black Boy. It was replaced by a different sign, which was soon replaced by the one that hangs there today. Both these later signs depict boys, but neither are black.  What happened to the old sign? And how did it come to be there in the first place? That boy was only the third dark-skinned boy I’d ever seen in Killay. The other two were my older brother and a classmate of his, the son of a Sri Lankan doctor. My brother and I were Indian-South-African-Dutch. The only person in the known history of my family to be born in Wales, I grew up with a definite sense of being Welsh, bolstered by my love of sport, and early aspirations play football for Swansea City and Wales. Having parents who had grown up in two different countries, and who put a great emphasis on fitting in, contributed to my sense of being Welsh.  I can vividly recall the first time I considered the question of whether or not I was black. I was seven years old. We lived on an avenue up the hill from the Black Boy pub, where kids regularly played outside. I was running from my house to the end of the street. As I passed our nextdoor neighbour Mr Thomas’s green Triumph, I “pushed off” with my right hand. The car pulled alongside me a few moments later. Mr Thomas leaned towards the open window on the passenger side: “Keep your filthy hands off my car you black bastard.”  Things fade from memory – or they don’t. The old pub sign is gone. It was first replaced by a picture of a smiling white boy with coal on his cheeks. This sign gave way to the present one: a white boy in perhaps Victorian garb, including a black jacket and hat, slightly unkempt, looking to his left, his eyes not visible.  I find one explanation at the library. “In Wales during the 18th century it was the height of fashion to employ a black servant. In the popular mindset Africa and the West Indies conjured up images of ivory, Guinea gold, sugar and coffee; in short, a limitless reservoir of wealth and luxury goods. A black domestic servant enables the owner to associate him- or herself with all that was fashionable about the New World. It also brought a touch of African exoticism into the parlours of rural Wales,” writes David Morris in Identifying the Black Presence in Eighteenth Century Wales, published in a 2008 issue of Llafur, the journal of the Welsh people’s history society of the same name.  This might go some way to explaining the name of the pub and the original sign, which was similar to paintings by William Hogarth from the 18th century. But there is more.  Swansea’s growth as a town was largely due to its copper industry. Copper, mined in Cornwall, was brought by boat to Swansea where it was smelted. By 1823, 10,000 of Swansea’s 15,000 residents were supported by the copper industry, earning the town the nickname “Copperopolis”.  This copper had many uses, including “copper bottoming” Nelson’s ships before the battle of Trafalgar. And, as historian Chris Evans explained in 2011, “Copper and brass articles were important as trade goods on the Guinea coast of Africa, either in the form of copper rods, wire or ingots, or as readymade semi-decorative items, such as manillas (bracelets), that eventually acted as an African currency … You could buy human beings with copper.” One such copper manilla can be viewed at Swansea Museum.  Evans nominated the White Rock Copper Works in Swansea to be an entry in the book 100 Places That Made Britain. He noted that the earliest known illustration of the copper works identifies one of its buildings as “Manilla House”. Black boys were bought with copper smelted at White Rock.  I am not the only person who has noticed the changing signs outside the Black Boy in Killay. The artist Daniel Trivedy exhibited a replica sign featuring the original image of the turbaned Black Boy on one side and the image from the current sign on the other. “Occasionally people find it necessary to alter the accounts of history to provide a more palatable version of events,” Trivedy told the South Wales Evening Post. “Perhaps this is the case with the Black Boy pub sign. However, to ignore the black presence in our history (and pub signs) is to deny the roots and heritage of multicultural Britain.”  The Black Boy Inn in Caernarfon, north Wales, which was named “the Welshest pub in the world” in 2016, has been the subject of some controversy over its name. But in 2008, John Evans, the owner, told the North Wales Daily Post: “I would never consider changing it, even if it was bad for business, because we have to hold on to our heritage.” The images of black boys on the signs outside his pub look to me like racist caricatures. Perhaps these, too, are part of “our” heritage?  Darren Chetty is a writer, teacher and researcher  ‘Essentially, there is no such thing as a Welsh accent’  One of my closest friends, born and bred in London, has joked for as long as I’ve known her about me not having a Welsh accent. It mirrors a conversation I’ve had hundreds of times. “Really? You don’t sound Welsh,” is about the size of it. Admittedly, I speak very differently to someone with what you might call a stereotypical Welsh accent. I’m not sure what people are expecting. Uncle Bryn from Gavin and Stacey, perhaps? Tom Jones? But I grew up at the other end of the country, more than 100 miles away from Barry and Pontypridd. Why would we sound the same?  The idiosyncratic cultures of Liverpool and Manchester, just 30 miles apart, are so widely understood, I don’t see why it should be so hard to grasp that a country of 8,000 square miles might have some regional variation in accent. Of course, given the common and pointless use of Wales’s landmass as a unit of measurement, I should say, rather than it being a country of 8,000 square miles, that it’s four times the size of Iceberg A-68, formerly of the Larsen C ice shelf, or that it’s equivalent to two million rugby pitches. Ah, rugby. We love rugby, us Welsh. All of us.  I love Wales, but that doesn’t mean I hate or even mildly dislike any other country, particularly England, where I’ve lived for more than 20 years. The rugby players from Caernarfon who used to refer to me and the rest of the Rhyl Youth team as “the Brookside 15” (after the 1980s TV soap set in Liverpool) as we stepped down from the coach really wound me up. But fair play, that’s what they were trying to do. The newcomer making conversation at a party, however, doesn’t deserve this level of discourse because a) they’re not Henry Higgins and b) I don’t sound like Richard Burton reading Under Milk Wood, or Vanessa Shanessa Jenkins ordering a takeaway.  But I am from Rhyl in north Wales, and sound very much as if I am. Beating any wags to the punchline, there’s absolutely no way you’d say you were from Rhyl if you weren’t. Having always spoken the way I do, in an accent many hear as a Lancashire/Cheshire hybrid with Welsh remnants in certain vowels and extended consonants, I just put it down to a bit of basic geography and received local wisdom. The town is 30 miles from the border with England, and there are lots of English residents in Rhyl – a legacy of postwar migration and, ever since, retirees seeking out some fresh seaside air. During non-pandemic summers, there are always plenty of English tourists around on the “Liverpool Riviera”, as it’s sometimes called. During the many summers I worked in the McDonald’s on the high street, had I not been surrounded in the kitchen by friends from school, I could easily have convinced myself I was working on Liverpool’s Lord Street or Oxford Road in Manchester.  “The accent in north Wales today will be pretty similar to what we would have heard after the second world war,” says Prof David Crystal, honorary professor of linguistics at Bangor University and a leading authority on accent and dialect. “After the first world war, you would have heard a stronger traditionally Welsh influence, but it still would have been broadly similar. In the late 19th century, however, Rhyl would have been very ‘Welsh’ sounding,” he says, suggesting the accent would have been much more in line with what we hear elsewhere in Denbighshire, a few miles south of Rhyl, and in Conwy, 18 miles west – that is, something more identifiably, stereotypically “Welsh” to outside ears.  In 2005, while presenting the Voices series for the BBC, Crystal travelled all over Wales to sample the accent in every corner of the country. “There’s a real switch around Conwy,” he told me of his findings. During Voices, Crystal and his team interviewed a number of people in my home town, including a family who have, for at least four generations, run the donkey rides on Rhyl beach. “They sounded as Lancashire as anything,” says Crystal. “Not exactly Lancs, but that’s the point. Even so, they felt as Welsh as the hills.”  For an explanation, we must go back to 1858, when Rhyl’s train station was opened. My accent, reasons Crystal, is more likely a result of Victorian tourism than anything else. Now mostly private houses and flats, the streets of the town’s West End were once lined with hotels and B&Bs catering for English visitors. Given Rhyl’s proximity to the north-west of England, tourists from Merseyside, Lancaster, the West Midlands and beyond, keen to see the sea, could visit for the day if they pleased.

Photograph: Science & Society Picture Library/Getty  As Crystal explains, when two people meet, an accommodation occurs, the shifting of accents towards or away from one another, depending on their relationship. It’s easy to imagine a situation in Victorian Rhyl where, as trainloads of holidaymakers with money to spend arrived in the town, entrepreneurial locals softened their Welsh accents to welcome their guests and make sure they were understood.  “There are always two forces driving language – intelligibility and identity,” says Crystal. “I have to understand you, but I also don’t want to be you. I wonder how much of the dilution in the Rhyl accent came from well-to-do English tourists not understanding the locals, and them modifying to allow for that.”  It’s definitely one in the eye for the old yarn in which the English visitor enters a pub in Wales only for the locals to stop nattering away in English and switch to their mother tongue. It was much more likely the other way around. Along the border with England, accents more traditionally associated with Gloucester and Hereford appear, while in Pembrokeshire – once referred to as Little England Beyond Wales – the English accent is strong, even among those born and raised there.  The Valleys accent – so often the Welsh accent people associate with the whole country – where did that come from? “Somerset,” says Crystal. “People arrived from Somerset to the Valleys, and if you think about it, they really are not that far apart. Essentially, there is no such thing as a Welsh accent. There are many, each as valid as another.”  So I do have a Welsh accent. It’s just not one you may have heard before.

The iron curtain slams down after the body blows of Brexit and Covid, amid Cop26 climate warnings. With Vladimir Putin’s invasion shaking Nato into life, refilling the war chest will reverse the peace dividend. Rocketing prices for gas, wheat and metals presage prolonged economic pain, as ever, unjustly shared.  These thunderbolts strike when Britain lacks resilience on almost every front. Last week Martin Rees, the astronomer royal and an ex-president of the Royal Society, gave a Cassandra warning in the Financial Times on our vulnerabilities. “The current system dooms Britain to remain perpetually unprepared” against “existential risks” from “the atomic bomb, biological weapons, artificial intelligence and climate change”. A chaotic and short-termist national risk register gives no “proper assessment of the dynamic nature of risks such as floods, cyber-attacks and bio threats”.  His words are restrained, but the Lords risk assessment and risk planning committee, of which he is a member, tolls a funereal bell on the country’s capacity to protect itself. Why this critical lack of resilience? Up jumped Jacob Rees-Mogg last week, the improbably titled minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, with a reminder of the reasons why, as he announced another 65,000 public servants were to be cut. These are the doers of mundane things protecting us from threats great and small, dangers distant or immediate. Westminster politicians can command, but if there’s no one on the end of the bell pull when it rings in the Downton public servants’ hall, nothing happens.  The curtain was pulled back when one appalled beginner revealed he was left alone in the Foreign Office with a failing computer system to cope with the tragic exodus from Kabul. Between government policies in parliament and actual delivery falls the shadow of monumental maladministration.  When the axe swung after 2010, the number of public servants dwindled to its lowest since the second world war. Then, irony of ironies, in escaping Brussels’ “red tape” and “bureaucrats”, says Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, “Brexit became a job creation scheme for civil servants”, as every department swelled to recreate lost EU functions. Numbers leapt up again to respond to Covid, but even then they were still well below 2010 levels. Some roles, such as test-and-tracers, will be shed, but, says Rutter, ministers picking a headline-grabbing number at random, regardless of skills and necessary tasks, is as absurd as the “one-in-two-out” rule for regulations plucked out of the air 10 years ago, which Iain Duncan Smith’s task force is trying to accelerate.  Here’s the perversity: ministers slice away the skills, experience and capacity that would be needed to carry out their own wishes. Let’s ignore how misguided their policies may be, and just look at their incapacity. Hardly a week passes without some breathtaking example tumbling out of the National Audit Office, the public accounts committee or select committees scrutinising Whitehall departments.  Last week, for example, the public accounts committee revealed official estimates that the state is unlikely to recoup up to £21bn of Covid business loans in “an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters”. That sum is so enormous it’s beyond counting in the usual currency of nurses, teachers or police officers, but think what damage it could repair. Cuts to due diligence on monitoring contracts is the worst possible value for money, as Rutter warns that reports of unchecked fraud undermine trust in HMRC, when the whole tax edifice relies on people’s willing compliance.  Take a deep breath here and let’s dash haphazardly through just the latest revelations. The law’n’order party has brought justice to a near halt through a lack of prosecutors, defending barristers and judges, with the backlog so long, cases are now listed for 2024. Last week’s official report showed rape cases in England and Wales take two years to get to court. Undertrained, understaffed and ill-equipped police fail to cope with a fraud epidemic, up by 43% in two years, causing the resignation of government minister Lord Agnew.  Some blunders are small but telling: last week the £1.3bn Kickstart scheme was revealed as “chaotically” failing to get a promised 100,000 young unemployed people into work or checking what employers had done with their £1,500 grants.  The Home Office asylum-seeker backlog has seen decision delays of more than a year rise ninefold in the past decade.  The 6 million-long NHS waiting list was already rising pre-Covid, due to cuts in doctor and nurse training and in beds, but now the length of time people are waiting for is also increasing: in 2010, there were virtually no people waiting for more than a year, now the figure in England stands at roughly 300,000.  Delays at the DVLA for driving licences and HGV driving tests long predate Covid. Add here the parlous state of the Environment Agency to cope with sewage outflows and floods, Natural England stripped bare, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs nowhere near defining its replacements for EU farm subsidies. A backlog of checks on restaurant hygiene and factory safety grows, the Institute for Government tells me, while children at risk are not referred to social services and education harm mounts due to catch-up failures in English and maths.  These are just snapshots of public services no longer there for the dull basics.  Look at this blustering government’s big talk and ponder how a broken-down machine can produce net-zero targets, “levelling up” and Brexit “opportunities”, let alone a whole new defence tilt. Here’s an exhibition performance in bad government decisions matched by failed administration – and it’s about to get worse. As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Rishi Sunak’s ill-timed Mais lecture promised tax cuts. Maybe ideological small-staters of the Rees-Mogg and Sunak stamp don’t much mind if the despised state fails to function, but voters do.

He may win all the battles but still lose the war. Putin’s dream of rebuilding the Russian empire has always rested on the lie that Ukraine isn’t a real nation, that Ukrainians aren’t a real people, and that the inhabitants of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv yearn for Moscow’s rule. That’s a complete lie – Ukraine is a nation with more than a thousand years of history, and Kyiv was already a major metropolis when Moscow was not even a village. But the Russian despot has told his lie so many times that he apparently believes it himself.  When planning his invasion of Ukraine, Putin could count on many known facts. He knew that militarily Russia dwarfs Ukraine. He knew that Nato would not send troops to help Ukraine. He knew that European dependence on Russian oil and gas would make countries like Germany hesitate about imposing stiff sanctions. Based on these known facts, his plan was to hit Ukraine hard and fast, decapitate its government, establish a puppet regime in Kyiv, and ride out the western sanctions.  But there was one big unknown about this plan. As the Americans learned in Iraq and the Soviets learned in Afghanistan, it is much easier to conquer a country than to hold it. Putin knew he had the power to conquer Ukraine. But would the Ukrainian people just accept Moscow’s puppet regime? Putin gambled that they would. After all, as he repeatedly explained to anyone willing to listen, Ukraine isn’t a real nation, and the Ukrainians aren’t a real people. In 2014, people in Crimea hardly resisted the Russian invaders. Why should 2022 be any different?  With each passing day, it is becoming clearer that Putin’s gamble is failing. The Ukrainian people are resisting with all their heart, winning the admiration of the entire world – and winning the war. Many dark days lie ahead. The Russians may still conquer the whole of Ukraine. But to win the war, the Russians would have to hold Ukraine, and they can do that only if the Ukrainian people let them. This seems increasingly unlikely to happen.  Each Russian tank destroyed and each Russian soldier killed increases the Ukrainians’ courage to resist. And each Ukrainian killed deepens the Ukrainians’ hatred of the invaders. Hatred is the ugliest of emotions. But for oppressed nations, hatred is a hidden treasure. Buried deep in the heart, it can sustain resistance for generations. To reestablish the Russian empire, Putin needs a relatively bloodless victory that will lead to a relatively hateless occupation. By spilling more and more Ukrainian blood, Putin is making sure his dream will never be realised. It won’t be Mikhail Gorbachev’s name written on the death certificate of the Russian empire: it will be Putin’s. Gorbachev left Russians and Ukrainians feeling like siblings; Putin has turned them into enemies, and has ensured that the Ukrainian nation will henceforth define itself in opposition to Russia.  Nations are ultimately built on stories. Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will tell not only in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come. The president who refused to flee the capital, telling the US that he needs ammunition, not a ride; the soldiers from Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”; the civilians who tried to stop Russian tanks by sitting in their path. This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.  The Russian despot should know this as well as anyone. As a child, he grew up on a diet of stories about German atrocities and Russian bravery in the siege of Leningrad. He is now producing similar stories, but casting himself in the role of Hitler.  The stories of Ukrainian bravery give resolve not only to the Ukrainians, but to the whole world. They give courage to the governments of European nations, to the US administration, and even to the oppressed citizens of Russia. If Ukrainians dare to stop a tank with their bare hands, the German government can dare to supply them with some anti-tank missiles, the US government can dare to cut Russia off Swift, and Russian citizens can dare to demonstrate their opposition to this senseless war.  We can all be inspired to dare to do something, whether it is make a donation, welcome refugees, or help with the struggle online. The war in Ukraine will shape the future of the entire world. If tyranny and aggression are allowed to win, we will all suffer the consequences. There is no point to remain just observers. It’s time to stand up and be counted.  Unfortunately, this war is likely to be long-lasting. Taking different forms, it may well continue for years. But the most important issue has already been decided. The last few days have proved to the entire world that Ukraine is a very real nation, that Ukrainians are a very real people, and that they definitely don’t want to live under a new Russian empire. The main question left open is how long it will take for this message to penetrate the Kremlin’s thick walls.  Yuval Noah Harari is a historian and author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

The news that Roman Abramovich is apparently giving up day-to-day control of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation has been interpreted in wildly different ways which, with the benefit of a little reflection, seems to have been the entire point of the exercise.  For some it is the ultimate sacrificial act of devotion: Abramovich’s way of insulating the club he adores from the threat of sanction, censure, even seizure. Big surprise: the billionaire oligarch has feelings! For others it is a cynical sleight of hand: the act of very grandiosely doing nothing at all, a solemn legal statement with no legal import whatsoever. For some it is a sign that nothing will be the same again. For others it is a sure sign that Abramovich is intent on ultimately making everything the same again.  Certainly if Abramovich had intended to clarify the ownership situation, or whether he intended to sell Chelsea, or what “stewardship and care” actually means in practice, or any of a number of issues currently worrying Chelsea fans, one assumes he would have done so.  Be nice if we could ask him, wouldn’t it? You know: take some lateral flows, sit him down for an hour with a few journalists or an audience of Chelsea fans. Pick his brains. Shoot the breeze. But the fact that this mundane scenario feels about as plausible as a page from a fantasy novel is, in many ways, the basic problem, a problem that goes far beyond one partially shaven Russian/Israeli/Portuguese citizen and his company credit card. Why does any owner of an asset as cherished as a local football club get to hide like this, essentially to communicate via smoke signals and the occasional managerial sacking? How, in the world’s most popular sport, did we allow one man – any man – to be simultaneously this powerful and this untouchable?  Democratic governments are accountable to their voters. Chief executives are accountable to their shareholders. Who is Abramovich accountable to? The Premier League? Fifa? The only thing we can say with any degree of certainty is that it is not Vladimir Putin. Definitely not Putin. Categorically. We know because a court said so. And so we must conclude that the modern football club owner is essentially a sort of renegade, an independent actor, answerable to nobody but his own theoretical conscience and the siren call of his desire.  From Mike Ashley at Newcastle to the Oyston family at Blackpool, to the Glazers at Manchester United to Mel Morris at Derby, the collateral damage caused by bad owners can be a form of trauma for the fans caught up in it. Abramovich, for his part, has been a reasonably popular absentee landlord, hoisting Chelsea from the depths of fourth place in the Premier League in 2003 to third place now, having spent more than £2bn and signed Nemanja Matic twice along the way. Yet even amid the serial rattle of silverware he is yet to answer any of the questions that have been swirling around him for almost two decades. Why football? Why Chelsea? How did you make your money and what exactly do you intend to do with it? And what is it you want here exactly?  Chelsea sold commemorative programme celebrating 10 years of Roman Abramovich being in charge back in 2013-14. Photograph: BPI/Shutterstock  Of course, we know why these questions remain unanswered. For decades English football, taking its lead from the British state, simply bent the knee to foreign capital, trusted in the innate virtue of wealth to the point where even to query the source of that wealth became an act of sabotage or treachery. Owners became gods, omnipotent and unshiftable, bending the rules and making the rules, fending off any attempt at scrutiny with armies of lawyers and lobbyists, spin and silence. Only now is football beginning to wake up to the stench of its own money, and yet the furious backpedalling of the Johnson government and the performative outrage of the footballing authorities suggests that the real red line was not morality but PR.  As ever the only real defence against all of this is organisation and resistance. The only reason Stamford Bridge has been kept out of Abramovich’s hands is through the resilience of the Chelsea Pitch Owners group. Fan solidarity, amplified by social media, helped to strangle the European Super League and belatedly force the government into a review of football governance. But the wider issue here is awareness: a realisation that the fight for sporting representation is really a microcosm of the wider struggle taking place across the board.  For all the senseless tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, Russia is not the enemy here. The dissent and protest of its own citizens in the face of a frightening state proves as much. The real faultline is between the powerful and the powerless, the rulers and the ruled. Recognising football’s complicity in war and cruelty also involves recognising that similar corruptions are occurring everywhere one looks.  The club you love has been trying to monetise you ever since you first clapped eyes on it. The bodies entrusted with the health of the sport are interested in player welfare, racism and competitive balance only to the extent that it might curdle their bottom line. The company whose services you engaged will do anything to avoid speaking to you on the phone. The government you voted in secretly despises you. Crisis has a habit of sharpening the contours of our world, of filtering out the noise. And up close an alarm bell sounds an awful lot like a million pennies dropping.

The 52-year-old German, who took the job last October, said he was “absolutely convinced” his decision was the right one.  Gisdol, who had previously spent his whole playing and coaching career in his homeland, most recently with Cologne, had been in charge for 12 matches.  He told Bild: “Being a football coach is the best job in the world. But I can’t do that job in a country whose leader has invaded another country in the middle of Europe. That does not go together with my values and I have therefore resigned as manager of Lokomotiv Moscow with immediate effect.  “I can’t stand at the training ground in Moscow and coach the players, ask them to be professional when a few kilometres away there are orders given that brings suffering to the people of a whole country. This is my personal decision and I am absolutely convinced it is the right one.”  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Gisdol’s move came the day after Fifa and Uefa acted in unison to suspend Russian teams from international football competition. It means Spartak Moscow, Russia’s one remaining club side in European competition, will no longer compete in the Europa League. Lokomotiv were also in the Europa League but finished bottom of their group.  Lokomotiv responded to Gisdol’s remarks by saying he had been sacked. “Markus Gisdol was dismissed from the post of head coach of FC Lokomotiv,” the club said in a tweet. “Marvin Compper will prepare the team for the upcoming games. The club and the team are working as usual and are concentrating on achieving the maximum result in the upcoming matches.”  Compper, a 36-year-old former centre-back, is also German.

The most powerful bodies in football joined the International Olympic Committee in acting after days of growing protest. The suspension means Russia will not be able to face Poland in a World Cup play-off semi-final next month, while its women’s team will also be barred from this summer’s European Championship in England and its remaining club side in European competition, Spartak Moscow, will no longer compete in the Europa League.  In a joint statement the two organisations said: “Fifa and Uefa have today decided together that all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both Fifa and Uefa competitions until further notice.  “These decisions were adopted today by the Bureau of the Fifa Council and the Executive Committee of Uefa, respectively the highest decision-making bodies of both institutions on such urgent matters. Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.”  Uefa also announced a second highly significant move, confirming that it had cancelled a long-standing and highly lucrative sponsorship deal with Gazprom. The Russian gas company had been a sponsor of the Champions League for a decade and the final of this year’s competition was to have been played in the Gazprom Arena in St Petersburg.  Last week Uefa moved the match to Paris, however, and has now severed the relationship entirely. “Uefa has today decided to end its partnership with Gazprom across all competitions,” a statement said. “The decision is effective immediately and covers all existing agreements including the Uefa Champions League, Uefa national team competitions and Uefa Euro 2024.”  Daniil Medvedev became men’s world No 1 on Monday. It is unclear what sporting sanctions will mean in non-team sports. Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/AP  On Sunday, Fifa had said that Russia could continue to compete in World Cup qualifying if they changed their name and played matches on neutral grounds. An action described by Fifa as taking “initial measures”, it was resisted fiercely by Poland, Russia’s opponents in World Cup qualification. The Polish stance was supported by a number of other European nations, too, including the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland.  As pressure grew on Fifa on Monday a change in direction was signalled by an intervention from the IOC. Citing the mission of the “Olympic Movement” to “contribute to peace through sport and to unite the world in peaceful competition beyond all political disputes”, the IOC issued a lengthy resolution calling on all sporting organisations to act.  “In order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants,” the resolution read, “the IOC Executive Board recommends that International Sports Federations and sports event organisers not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions”.  The IOC added a condition, however, which could yet mean Russia competes in the Winter Paralympics which start in Beijing this weekend. In situations where short notice “for organisational or legal reasons” meant Russia and its ally in the invasion of Ukraine, Belarus, could not be excluded, they “should be accepted only as neutral athletes or neutral teams”, the IOC said. This would be a similar sanction to that applied to Russia at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, where “no national symbols, colours, flags or anthems should be displayed”.  The Ukrainian delegation for the Winter Paralympics is yet to arrive in Beijing due to the invasion and on Monday evening the British Olympic Association called for Russian athletes to be banned immediately from competition.  “Together with the National Olympic Committee of Germany, [we demand] the immediate exclusion of Russia and Belarus from the international sports family until further notice,” the BOA said. “We call on the international sports federations to ban athletes representing Russia and Belarus from competitions for the time being and to suspend Russian and Belarusian officials from their positions.”  There are further questions now likely to be asked over the involvement of Russian athletes in non-Russian teams, and also in individual sports. One of the most prominent examples is Daniil Medvedev who took over the mantle of the men’s world No 1 tennis player from Novak Djokovic on Monday and over the weekend made a statement calling for peace.  The Ukrainian Tennis Federation board member Seva Kevlych told Reuters that Medvedev should not be allowed to compete in grand slam matches. “Let [Medvedev] play on the ATP Tour but grand slams are ITF events and if you lose the possibility to play in grand slams he could never be world No 1,” Kevlych said. “He shouldn’t play in the French Open, US Open and Wimbledon.”  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Kevlych’s words echoed a broader, sweeping agenda for action against Russia issued by Ukraine’s ministry of sport. Arguing that “Russian authorities use sport achievements for propaganda of their own ideology” and as “a tool for popularizing ideas of bullying, murder and destruction”, the ministry called not only for athletes to be excluded from competition but for Russian representatives to also be removed from governing bodies and Russian companies from being allowed to act as sponsors.

The unions from the respective countries have been barred from all international rugby and cross-border club rugby activities until further notice. Furthermore, the Rugby Union of Russia has been suspended from World Rugby membership.  This decision, in line with recommendations by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and building on last week’s decision by Rugby Europe to suspend Russia’s home activities in the Rugby Europe Championship, was taken by the World Rugby Executive Committee in order to “protect the rugby family and take a strong stance against the conflict.”  In a statement released on Tuesday, World Rugby reiterated its condemnation of “Russia’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine and the facilitation of this action by Belarus. The global rugby family is united in standing in solidarity with everyone affected by these deeply disturbing events and joins the global community in calling for the restoration of peace.  “The decision has been taken with the interests of rugby’s values of solidarity, integrity and respect at heart. World Rugby also remains in contact with colleagues at the Ukraine Rugby Federation and has pledged its full support to the rugby community in the country.”  Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a source close to the Russian national team said that it was a “sad day” for the sport and that “proud athletes who love nothing more than representing their country were being punished.  “There are good people in Russian rugby and no one wants war,” the source said. “Some of the players are worried. It’s a very scary time for everyone. I don’t think anyone thought it would come to this. It’s surreal. We’re all hoping it gets resolved as quickly as possible.”  Three days after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Russia’s Rugby Europe Championship match against Georgia in Tbilisi was cancelled. With two defeats from as many matches, Russia were bottom of the log in Europe’s second tier international competition.  Russia had not yet qualified for next year’s World Cup in France and this suspension effectively ends their hopes of doing so.  A spokesperson for World Rugby told the Guardian: “World Rugby has no Russian sponsorship or planned events hosted in Russia or Belarus. Russia is also not involved in the bidding process for future men’s or women’s Rugby World Cups.”  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Elsewhere the Rugby Football Union has reportedly contacted Fifa to express its opposition to a proposed name-change of the Russian football team which would see both organisations share the initials ‘RFU’.  Fifa had come under criticism for its lukewarm stance against Russia last week, failing to expel its football teams from international tournaments. However, this changed on Monday with Fifa joining Uefa in banning the country from all international and club competitions.  The international governing bodies for ice hockey and curling, as well as Formula One, the National Hockey League and the US Soccer Federation are among those organisations which have already placed sanctions on Russian athletes and events.

Now, as Luke Harding reports from Lviv, he personifies the defiance and dignity of Ukraine’s embattled population  On Saturday morning, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s latest video popped up on social media feeds around the world. “Good morning everybody! Ukrainians: there’s a lot of fake information online that I called on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s an evacuation,” he said. “I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state, our territory, our Ukraine, our children. That’s all I have to say. Glory to Ukraine!”  As Luke Harding tells Michael Safi, the transformation of Zelenskiy from a comic actor to Ukraine’s president was a barely believable tale in itself but now, in the face of one of the world’s largest armies bearing down on his capital, he has become an embodiment of the resilience and character his population are showing.  His intended audience is threefold. First and foremost his fellow Ukrainians, who he addresses directly and encourages to continue the defence of their homeland and to assure them that propaganda claiming he has fled Kyiv is false. He is also addressing ordinary Russians in their native tongue to argue against Vladimir Putin’s claims, saying “neighbours always enrich each other’s cultures. However, we are not part of one whole. You cannot swallow us up.” And finally he has been speaking in English to the international community where his bravery has won him global acclaim as well as several big diplomatic victories as Russia is frozen out of financial markets and aid to Ukraine is sped through.

The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion.  They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership.  In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed.  Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend.  Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border.  It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000.  For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack  Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far?  Putin: pursuing an old Soviet glory? Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Vladimir Putin  The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded.  A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema.  Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy.  Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia.  More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep.  Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas.  At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word.  Joe Biden: a message to China as well as to Russia. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  Joe Biden  The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster.  Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state.  Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan.  Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move.  Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.  Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution.  Zelenskiy: under pressure to go slowly on Nato membership. Photograph: Reuters  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine’s president impressed world leaders in the Munich security conference this weekend with a brave and punchy speech after ignoring warnings to stay at home for fear of a Russian-inspired coup attempt. His response to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put.  One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides.  Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s.  True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force.  Scholz and Macron: soft line and hard line? Photograph: Getty Images  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz  Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises.  These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war.  Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front.  While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions.  Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights.  That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach.  The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far.  Johnson (right, with Zelenskiy): errand boy for America? Photograph: Getty Images  Boris Johnson  Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it.  At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally.  The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid.  But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff.  Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London.  All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America.  When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.

In a case that could have profound implications for those affected by the crisis, the supreme court considered an argument brought by West Virginia, a major coal mining state, that the US Environmental Protection Agency be limited in how it regulates planet-heating gases from the energy sector.  The Biden administration wants the court to throw out the case as baseless because it doesn’t relate to any existing regulation.  But John Roberts, the chief justice, said West Virginia and other states could still claim some “harm” from rules not yet enacted.  Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative, noted that the court had previously expressed “skepticism” about the government’s ability to regulate a “significant portion of the American economy”.  Amy Coney Barrett, like Kavanaugh nominated by Donald Trump, indicated, however, that the EPA had the expertise to regulate in this area.  The case has deeply worried environmental groups, stoking fear it could hobble any effort to set strict limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired plants.  “It was grotesque to hear big coal’s lawyers argue for tying EPA’s hands on cutting climate-heating pollution, even as the world’s scientists warn of a bigger, worsening swath of human suffering,” said Jason Rylander, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, referring to a report released on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  “We’re out of time and the president must act boldly now,” Rylander said.  The Biden administration is already dealing with congressional refusal to enact the climate change proposals in its Build Better Back domestic spending plan. Now the justices are taking up an appeal from 19 mostly Republican-led states and coal companies over whether the EPA has the authority to limit carbon dioxide emissions.  Biden has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade.  A broad ruling could also weaken regulatory efforts that extend well beyond the environment, including consumer protections, workplace safety and public health.  Several conservatives on the court have criticized what they see as the unchecked power of federal agencies, concerns evident in orders throwing out two Biden policies aimed at reducing the spread of Covid-19.  Last summer, the 6-3 conservative majority ended a pause on evictions over unpaid rent. In January, the same six justices blocked a requirement that workers at large employers be vaccinated or test regularly and wear a mask on the job.  The West Virginia attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, has cast the power plant case as about who should make the rules.  “Should it be unelected bureaucrats or should it be the people’s representatives in Congress?“ Morrisey said.  David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the court’s consideration of the issue was premature. He said Biden’s opponents were advancing “horror stories about extreme regulations the EPA may issue in the future. The EPA is writing a new rule on a clean slate.”  The case has a long and complicated history that begins with the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. That would have required states to reduce emissions from the generation of electricity, mainly by shifting away from coal. But it never took effect. In a 2016 lawsuit filed by West Virginia and others, the supreme court blocked it by a 5-4 vote, with conservatives in the majority.  After Trump took office, the EPA repealed the plan. The agency argued its authority to reduce carbon emissions was limited and it devised a new plan that sharply reduced the federal government’s role.  New York, 21 other mainly Democratic states, the District of Columbia and some of the largest US cities sued. The federal appeals court in Washington ruled against both the repeal and the new plan, leaving nothing in effect while the new administration drafted a new policy.  Adding to the unusual nature of the supreme court’s involvement, the reductions sought in the Obama plan by 2030 have been achieved through the market-driven closure of hundreds of coal plants.  The Biden administration has no intention of reviving the Clean Power Plan, one reason the solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration’s top supreme court lawyer, argues the court should dismiss the case.  Some of the nation’s largest electric utilities, serving 40 million people, are supporting the Biden administration, as are prominent businesses including Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla. A decision is expected by late June.

Food price inflation reached 4.3% last month, the highest level seen since September 2013, as the price of items including savoury snacks, fresh beef and cat food rose the fastest. However the cost of some products, including bacon, beer, and spirits has been falling.  Britain’s households are already facing a cost of living crisis, after the UK’s annual inflation rate hit 5.5% in January, hitting its highest level in almost 30 years. However, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, economists had predicted that there was more pain to come in April, when household energy bills will soar.  Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, predicted that food prices are likely to continue their climb:  Apart from the start of the pandemic, when we saw grocers cut promotional deals to maintain availability, this is the fastest rate of inflation we’ve recorded since September 2013. Added to this, ongoing supply chain pressures and the potential impact of the conflict in Ukraine are set to continue pushing up prices paid by consumers.

Karim Khan said that although Ukraine was not a member of the ICC, it had awarded jurisdiction to the court. He said that there was grounds to open an investigation based on a previous preliminary investigation on Crimea and the Donbas published last year, and on current events in Ukraine.  “I have already tasked my team to explore all evidence preservation opportunities,” Khan, a British lawyer, said.  He said that he could go to ICC judges to approve the inquiry, but it would be faster if an ICC member state referred the case to his office, “which would allow us to actively and immediately proceed with the office’s independent and objective investigations”.  Earlier in the day, Lithuania had called on the ICC to open an investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russia and Belarus in Ukraine.  Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, told the Washington Post: “What Putin is doing is just a murder and nothing else, and I hope he will be in The Hague.”  With evidence mounting of Russia’s use of indiscriminate cluster munitions on Ukrainian cities, and the leveling of residential buildings in Kharkiv in particular, the government in Kyiv is also preparing a case against Moscow to take to The Hague.  Ukraine has also taken Russia to the international court of justice (ICJ) for having launched an invasion on the pretext of false claims of genocide perpetrated against the country’s Russian speakers.  David Bosco, an expert on international justice at Indiana University, said the ICJ submission “is kind of a symbolic move by Ukraine”.  “That’s not going to yield very much because it’s not actually clear that ICJ is going to have jurisdiction,” Bosco said. “And then even if they do, it’s something that would take a long, long time.”  Even before Khan’s announcement several groups had started to collate war crimes evidence for use for future trials at the ICC or elsewhere.  Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigative journalism agency, said the group was working with other organisations to preserve evidence that would be accepted in court.  “We’ve been working on issues related to accountability using open source evidence for a long time, so we’re very familiar with the needs of stakeholders like the ICC,” Higgins said.  “Our goal would then be to make that data available to any accountability process that wants to use it. We aim to have, at a minimum, date and geolocation data, and then work to add other data, such as the type of violation documented, munitions featured in videos, etc.”  Khan’s predecessor as ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, announced in 2020 that there was enough evidence from the conflict in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to launch an investigation but the ICC judges did not give their approval. Khan said that, after reviewing Bensouda’s case, “I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine.”  Bosco said that in the wake of the Lithuanian submission, Khan would not have to seek the judges’ approval to launch a new investigation, and so could move swiftly to start work.  “If the ICC is going to investigate, that means from their perspective they have jurisdiction over any Russians on Ukrainian territory and over any crimes committed on Ukrainian territory,” Bosco said. “But it’s got to be either war crimes, crime against humanity or genocide.”  The Rome statute, the ICC’s founding document, was amended in 2018 to include the crime of aggression. However, in his statement, Khan said he did not have jurisdiction to investigate that crime because neither Russia nor Ukraine are signatories to the Rome statute.

The range of so-called Putin-Versteher (Putin-understanders) – those who have sought to explain or justify the Russian leader’s actions – include figures from the far-left Die Linke and the far-right AfD, as well as members of the Social Democrats and some conservatives who have tried to keep him on side in the interests of their constituents and German energy security.  “Putin-Versteher are on the precipice,” the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Sunday (FAS) said, listing an array of German politicians it said were now paying the price for having mistakenly thought they could “tame Vladimir Putin with empathy and friendly accommodation”.  The former German chancellor and head of the Nord Stream 2 administrative board, Gerhard Schröder, emphasised Putin’s ‘clubbability’. Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/AP  The tabloid Bild went further, describing a range of politicians as “Putin Streichler” – or Putin caressers – saying over the past 20 years these included not just former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, but the former Social Democrat foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, now Germany’s president, the former state leader of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, and Angela Merkel, who it accused of pushing the building of Nord Stream 2 and holding back with sanctions even amid widespread evidence of Kremlin misbehaviour.  But the invasion of Ukraine has marked a turning point, with analysts concluding that many politicians had been stunned into a change of heart.  Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has now expressed regret over past policy failures relating to Russia. Photograph: Jens Schlueter/AFP/Getty Images  Germany’s former defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer implied that some Germans, including herself, had taken a shamefully naive approach towards Putin’s politics.  “I’m so angry at ourselves for our historical failure,” she wrote on Twitter. “After Georgia, Crimea and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin.”  But many German politicians actively courted Putin, most prominently Schröder, who went out of his way to emphasise the Russian leader’s harmless clubbability.  Schröder, who is reportedly recovering from coronavirus, was called upon at the weekend to condemn the invasion or face being thrown out of the Social Democratic (SPD) party over his close business ties to Russian energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft.  In its strongest appeal yet to Schröder, Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s co-head, a former close ally, urged him to cut all business ties with Putin. “This war starts with Putin and Putin only, and therefore it can be the only logical conclusion that you cannot do business with an aggressor, a warmonger,” Klingbeil said.  Rainer Arnold, a former MP and an SPD member who was the parliamentary group’s spokesman on defence between 2002 and 2018, went further, appealing to Schröder to “save the SPD and you yourself further sustained embarrassing and excruciating debates about your egotistical engagement with Putin, a man whose interests are just as egotistical as well as inhuman”.  Schröder, who had previously referred to Ukraine’s request for arms as “sabre rattling”, on Thursday called on the “government in Moscow” to end the conflict “as soon as possible” saying it was not in Russia’s security interests to pursue the conflict. But he stopped short of mentioning Putin or referring to a war.  Others associated with Nord Stream 2 appear to be rapidly distancing themselves from the project, which was halted by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, (also of the SPD) last week in direct response to the invasion.  Within the far-left Die Linke, Sahra Wagenknecht has admitted she was wrong to insist Russia was not planning to invade Ukraine. Insiders have said she had been forced into a rethink, particularly over sanctions, which she has rejected in the past.  Stephan Protschka of the AfD told the FAS he felt “deeply deceived” by Putin, which elements of his party have admired for standing up to the “imperial west”. He told the paper he had, at most, expected there to be a trade war between Russia and the west and had accordingly “stocked up with wood” for his oven heater in order to brave an energy crisis. “I had had a degree of understanding for the way in which Putin felt he had been driven into a corner,” he said. “But now my understanding has run out.”

The US side of the international space station (ISS) supplies power and life support, Russia is responsible for propulsion and keeping the station afloat: it does this by using docked Progress spacecraft to periodically give the station a boost to maintain its altitude of approximately 400km (250 miles).  Last week, though, Russia’s Roscosmos space chief Dmitry Rogozin raised the prospect of pulling out of the partnership in response to US sanctions.  Kathy Lueders, who heads the agency’s human spaceflight program, said US aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman had offered a reboost capability.  “And, you know, our SpaceX folks are looking at can we have additional capability,” she said.  Lueders added that operations at the space station were proceeding “nominally” and “we’re not getting any indications at a working level that our counterparts are not committed”.  “That said, we always look for how do we get more operational flexibility and our cargo providers are looking at how do we add different capabilities,” she said.  The last Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo vessel that arrived at the ISS on 21 February was the first to boast a capacity to “reboost” the outpost without Russian help.  On Friday, SpaceX boss Elon Musk tweeted his company’s logo in response to Rogozin’s rhetorical question about who would save the ISS from an uncontrolled de-orbit.  But Lueders stressed that such plans were a contingency measure only. “It would be very difficult for us to be operating on our own – ISS is an international partnership that was created … with joint dependencies,” she said.  “As a team, we are looking at where we may have operational flexibilities, but … it would be a sad day for international operations if we can’t continue to peacefully operate in space,” she said.  A symbol of post cold war detente, the ISS has been continuously habited for more than 21 years and has weathered past geopolitical storms, notably Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014. But some observers believe the invasion of Ukraine could hasten the demise of US-Russian space cooperation.

The president will speak to Congress and the nation from the Capitol. The Republican rebuttal will be delivered by Kim Reynolds, governor of Iowa.  Tlaib will also respond, for the Working Families party. It will not be the only Democratic response: Collin Alred of Texas will speak for the Congressional Black Caucus.  One moderate Democrat, Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said Tlaib’s decision to speak was “like keying your own car and slashing your own tires”.  Tlaib said: “Despite some sensational coverage, it’s simple: I’m giving a speech about supporting President Biden and his Build Back Better agenda for the people.”  Build Back Better, valued at $1.75tn and meant to improve health and social care and address the climate crisis, passed the House with moderate support. But it stalled in the Senate, opposed by Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.  Biden’s State of the Union address will be overshadowed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But he is expected to reframe his domestic ambitions. Tlaib will highlight the cost of not passing Build Back Better.  The Working Families party was formed in 1998 by unions and other groups. It aims to “build our own party on top of the two-party system in the United States”, sometimes running candidates in Democratic primaries, seeking to build “the multiracial movement we need to win the America we deserve”.  On Monday, Maurice Mitchell, the party’s national director, said: “Obstructionist Republicans and a handful of corporate Democrats have ground Washington to a standstill while child poverty spikes and costs continue to rise for housing, healthcare and childcare.  “It doesn’t have to be this way.”  Gottheimer played a prominent role in negotiations over Build Back Better and Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure plan, which passed with Republican support. He told Axios Tlaib’s speech would be “massively counterproductive”.  He added: “This only highlights the real tension between the socialist far left and the common-sense moderate wing, which is focused on crime, costs, tax cuts and affordability and turning the page on Covid.”  Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said it was “astonishing” that the “radical left continues to promote a Democratic death wish, and sees no problem relegating our party to the permanent minority”.  Tlaib said Americans should “look past the headlines and hear progressives’ vision for working with the president and Congress to deliver for our residents”.  Biden will deliver his first State of the Union with his approval rating at new lows and with Republicans favoured to re-take the House in November.

Benedetti, a Grammy and Brit awards winner, is also the first Scot to direct the festival since its foundation in 1947, adding to the dramatic impact her appointment is likely to have on the event’s wider popularity and fame.  In a brief statement, Benedetti said: “I am deeply honoured to contribute to the long and rich history of the Edinburgh international festival and the cultural landscape of Scotland. This festival was founded on principles of reconciliation and the ideals of art transcending political and cultural fracture.”  She will succeed Fergus Linehan, an Irish arts administrator who staged his first festival in 2015, in October. At 34, she is also one of the festival’s youngest directors. Its third director, Robert Ponsonby, was 30 when he took control in 1954.  Benedetti has been appointed as the festival prepares to celebrate its 75th anniversary this year. Linehan, who will announce August’s festival programme this month, has previously said he wants the event to be a “huge civic moment from celebration to requiem” after the Covid crisis.  On Monday evening, the festival announced that Valery Gergiev, the Russian conductor who is a close friend and ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had stepped down as its honorary president.  The EIF said it had asked him to resign. “Edinburgh is twinned with the city of Kyiv and this action is being taken in sympathy with, and support of, its citizens,” it said.  In 2020, the festival was in effect cancelled for the first time in its history, producing a handful of online-only events; last year, there were a reduced number of in-person events, with much smaller audiences, but with heavy investment in digital streaming of its productions.  Unlike her immediate predecessors, Benedetti has no experience running large arts festivals but has built up a significant reputation as an arts educator and ambassador for classical music, particularly with younger musicians and schools. She won BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2004.  A champion of modern compositions, the soloist became the youngest recipient of the Queen’s medal for music in 2017 and formed the Benedetti Baroque Orchestra in 2020. Her violin concerto to a score by the jazz trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis also won a Grammy that year.  In a speech to the Royal Philharmonic Society in 2019, Benedetti said music “is the art of all the things we can’t see or touch. [It] brings millions together through the basic act of listening and thousands together through the act of making melody, rhythm and harmony in the practice and service of collective expression”.  Keith Skeoch, an investment banker who chairs the festival’s board of trustees, said: “In many ways she reflects the spirit of this festival. Internationally recognised and respected but Scottish to her core, she’s dedicated to advocating world-class music making and innovating new ways to bring it to audiences.”  Founded to revitalise European classic music in the aftermath of the second world war, the Edinburgh international festival has sought to increase its artistic and cultural diversity under Linehan and his Australian predecessor, Sir Jonathan Mills.  Its current board, appointed in 2019, is the first in the event’s history to have a female majority membership and greater ethnic diversity, signalling its intentions to become more representative and, by appointing members with expertise in digital arts, broaden its output.  Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said: “I welcome Nicola Benedetti’s appointment as director – especially as she becomes the first woman to ever hold the role. Her experience in promoting Scotland’s cultural scene to audiences around the world will be invaluable and I wish her every success.”

Now researchers studying its fossils have suggested the beast may not have been the only tyrannosaurus species.  Experts studying remains thought to belong to T rex have suggested their variation shows evidence of not one species but three.  The lead author of the research, Gregory Paul, who was a dinosaur specialist on the film Jurassic Park, said the findings had multiple implications, noting that previously experts had studied the growth of the T rex using remains from different rock layers.  “That may not be a good idea to do because you may be [looking at] different species,” he said.  The team say it is to be expected that more than one tyrannosaurus species evolved over their million-or-so years on Earth, as has been found for other dinosaurs who lived at the same time, such as triceratops.  Writing in the journal Evolutionary Biology, Paul and colleagues report how previous work has revealed that fossilised bones designated as being from T rex vary in terms of their stout build or “robustness”, and different specimens had one or two pairs of lower incisor-like teeth.  Paul and colleagues studied a total of 37 specimens attributed to T rex, in particular looking at the length and circumference of the thigh bones, available for about two-thirds of the specimens, to assess their robustness.  The team say their findings suggest differences in the robustness of the thigh bones are unlikely to be down to individual variation.  “We found that the robustness in the sample we have of tyrannosaurus, the variation of the femur is greater than all other tyrannosaurids combined over 10m years of evolution,” said Paul. “You can’t just not pay attention to that.”  The team say the variation does not appear to be linked to the overall size of the specimen or how mature the animal was when it died, while other factors – such as the uneven ratio of more robust bones to those that were more slender, or “gracile” – suggests such variation is unlikely to be linked to the sex of the beasts.  What’s more, fossils with more gracile bones were only found in higher layers of sediment, and these and more robust specimens found alongside them tended to have only one incisor-like tooth in the lower jaw, in contrast to the robust specimens in lower layers.  While the team say they cannot rule out other explanations for the findings, they propose that specimens found in lower layers are probably from one species they have called Tyrannosaurus imperator, or tyrant lizard emperor; the later, stocky-boned specimens are from Tyrannosaurus rex; and the slender-boned specimens are from a third species the team have called Tyrannosaurus regina, or tyrant lizard queen.  Prof Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work, said he was not convinced.  “I understand the temptation to divide T rex into different species, because there is some variation in the fossil bones that we have. But ultimately, to me, this variation is very minor and not indicative of meaningful biological separation of distinct species that can be defined based on clear, explicit, consistent differences,” he said.  Prof Thomas Carr, a T rex expert at Carthage College in the US, also disputed the results, saying the definitions of the different species put forward by the team were vague, and the findings were at odds with his own work in which he analysed variations in 1,850 different features in 31 specimens. “I found no evidence of more than one species. And if that signal was in the data, I would have picked it up,” he said.  Carr said another concern was that the study included specimens from privately owned or commercial outfits, affecting the ability of researchers to reproduce the results.  Nevertheless, Paul said it would be decades before there were enough museum specimens to do a statistical analysis. He said the variations were significant. “Other dinosaurs species have been named on less data,” he said.

Not only has Russia been stripped of two prestigious events – the Champions League men’s final and Formula One’s Russian Grand Prix –but an increasing number of performances by Russians are being cancelled worldwide.  Eurovision  The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said Russia would no longer be allowed to participate in this year’s Eurovision song contest.  EBU, the producers of Eurovision, said the event promoted “international exchange and understanding”, adding that Russia’s inclusion could bring the annual competition into disrepute “in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine”.  State broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands had called for Russia to be banned from the contest, which takes place in Turin in May. The UK culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, endorsed the move.  Eurovision stands for freedom, unity and respect between countries - watched and enjoyed by tens of millions around the world.    Glad to see @Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out. https://t.co/3YvH3aZQ0Q — Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorries) February 25, 2022  Ballet  The Royal Opera House has cancelled a planned residency by Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet, one of the oldest and most prestigious ballet companies in the world.  “A summer season of the Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Opera House had been in the final stages of planning,” the ROH said. “Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, the season cannot now go ahead.” The dance troupe had been due to stage 21 performances from 26 July to 14 August.  Performances by the Russian State Ballet of Siberia have been cancelled by Wolverhampton Grand Theatre and the Royal and Derngate in Northampton. The local Ukrainian community had previously called for the cancellations.  Given the situation in Ukraine, Royal & Derngate have taken the decision to cancel today’s performances of The Russian State Ballet. — Royal & Derngate (@RoyalDerngate) February 26, 2022  The Helix theatre in Dublin also cancelled a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Moscow Ballet “to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine”.  Concerts  The Munich Philharmonic has parted ways with its chief conductor, Valery Gergiev, over his ties to Putin. Munich’s mayor, Dieter Reiter, had issued an ultimatum, saying Gergiev would be dismissed if he failed to condemn Putin’s actions by Monday.  “With immediate effect, there will be no further concerts by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra under his direction,” Reiter said.  Gergiev has been dropped by his management and had several upcoming concerts cancelled. The Edinburgh International Festival, of which he was honorary president, has asked for his resignation. “Edinburgh is twinned with the city of Kyiv and this action is being taken in sympathy with, and support of, its citizens,” it said.  Gergiev is currently conducting Tchaikovsky’s The Queen of Spades at La Scala in Milan, where it was reportedly booed by audiences last week. The opera house said an upcoming appearance will be cancelled if he does not speak out against Putin.  The Rotterdam Philharmonic also threatened to cancel its longstanding annual Gergiev festival this year, Switzerland’s Verbier festival has asked Gergiev to resign his position as music director of the Verbier Festival Orchestra, and in New York, he was replaced for performances with the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall. A Carnegie Hall spokesperson attributed the decision to “recent world events”.  A pair of upcoming performances in May by Russia’s Mariinsky Orchestra, which were due to be led by Gergiev at Carnegie Hall, have also been cancelled.  Meanwhile, Louis Tomlinson, Franz Ferdinand and Green Day are among the acts to have withdrawn from gigs in Russia. Tomlinson said: “The safety of my fans is my priority and my thoughts go out to the people of Ukraine and all those suffering from this needless war.”  Art  The Russian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale will not take place as planned this year after Russian artists and curators themselves pulled out.  The artists Alexandra Sukhareva and Kirill Savchenkov, as well as the curator Raimundas Malašauskas, said they would no longer participate.  “There is no place for art when civilians are dying under the fire of missiles, when citizens of Ukraine are hiding in shelters, when Russian protesters are getting silenced,” Savchenkov and Sukhareva said in a joint statement. The organisers of the pavilion said in an Instagram post that the pavilion would remain closed.  The Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow said it would halt preparations for upcoming shows, while exhibitions at GES-2 House of Culture – including one by Ragnar Kjartansson – were also suspended.  In the UK, the Victoria and Albert Museum has said it is in talks with the culture department about the “rapidly evolving situation”. The museum’s exhibition on Peter Carl Fabergé features many of his priceless eggs on loan from museums in Russia.  Film  Warner Bros, Disney and Sony have halted the release of films in Russian cinemas. This means releases of major movies including The Batman, Turning Red and Morbius will not go ahead as scheduled in the country.  “In light of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, WarnerMedia is pausing the release of its feature film The Batman in Russia,” a spokesperson said.  Disney said: “Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the theatrical release of films in Russia.”  The Ukrainian Film Academy has called for an international boycott of Russian cinema, including a ban on Russian films at international festivals.  In an online petition, the organisation said: “At a time when world powers are imposing economic and political sanctions on the Russian Federation, the country continues to be active in the cultural field”. Any action, however, is yet to be taken.

I was planning to walk alone up a scrub-covered cliff face in a remote part of the Ionian island of Ithaca: locals said there was no path any more, after serious earthquake damage in the 1950s. Ithaca is known as the home of Odysseus, to which he returned after 10 years of adventures. It lies in the shadow of larger Kephalonia, which has grown rich on Captain Corelli, an airport and some fine beaches.  An experienced walker of unpredictable Greek island paths (but not a rock climber), I was doing this hike for three reasons. First, I’d been employed to check all the walks in author Jane Cochrane’s latest book, Walking in the Footsteps of Odysseus. Second, in mythology, Telemachus, son of Odysseus, landed secretly at Pera Pigadi after returning from a fruitless search for his absent father and then scaled these rocks, called Korakos Petra, to meet the family’s loyal servant Eumaeus (and a mysterious visitor who turned out to be Odysseus in disguise). And third? Because they said it couldn’t be done …  Statue of Odysseus in a sculpture park at Kollieri in northern Ithaca. Photograph: Nigel Summerley  It was at Eumaeus’s house, on the plain atop the cliff, that Odysseus plotted how to kill the 100-plus suitors who had been bothering his wife, Penelope, for close on a decade.  Jane Cochrane is a retired architect who has had a home on Ithaca since the 1980s. I knew all about her and her late husband, Alec Kazantzis, from her 2019 autobiographical book Odysseus’ Island; she knew that I’d spent a lot of 2020 following the post-Troy route of Odysseus around Greece and Italy.  For her new guidebook to Ithaca, Jane aimed to lead the visitor to places associated by scholars with the words of Homer, whose descriptions in The Odyssey are so geographically accurate that she was convinced he knew the island first-hand. The plan was for us to combine forces to follow in the steps of his protagonists.  Jane had no intention of risking Korakos Petra, though. “But if you want to give it a go,” she told me, “I can double back, get my car and meet you at the top!”  So we hired a boat to take us out around the coast to Pera Pigadi. Landing here is tricky. Our skipper, Pierre, sailed as close as he could then, stripping to his underwear, jumped overboard and pulled the boat in as far as possible. I waded ashore after him, holding my clothes above the water. I looked up at the 250-metre white cliff towering above skirts of wild greenery and a deep, deep ravine; it was like something from The Lost World.  According to legend, a hunter called Korax fell to his death here, and his grieving mother, Arethusa, hanged herself next to a nearby spring. I had no intention of joining Korax, but I didn’t know at this point how close I would come to doing so.  Nigel Summerley sets off from Pera Pigadi Bay to climb Korakos Petra. Photograph: Jane Cochrane  In hi-vis T-shirt, jeans to protect my legs, and with soaked underwear tied to my stick to dry, I made my way up a footpath to Arethusa’s spring, a lovelier spot than its dark history suggested. But from there to the top there was nothing to help the hiker – definitely no path.  I had planned to fill my water bottle from Arethusa’s deep natural well – but its rusted bucket leaked most of its contents before I could haul it up. After half a dozen tries I managed to get a decent amount, but another thing I didn’t know was that the bottle and I were not to be together for long.  Beyond the spring, the rock wall rises like a fortification, with barely any footholds or handholds. The ravine was to my left and I had to go up and over it at its narrowest point in order to carry on to the top. As I inched my way up, I kept tossing my bottle and stick up ahead of me to leave hands free for holding on. I failed to resist the temptation to look down. Not far below were the tops of tall trees growing in the ravine; I couldn’t see how far it was to the bottom but it was a lethal-looking distance. More than once, as my fingertips held tight to almost nothing, I had that dread feeling that I was about to fall – and that before I hit the bottom, I would feel exceedingly stupid.  I looked up at the white cliff towering above a deep ravine; it was like something from The Lost World  The water bottle rolled off a ledge and past me at a moment when I was above a sheer drop and dared not free a hand to catch it. I watched it bounce in slow motion into the depths and disappear.  Getting over the ravine was the most dangerous bit of the climb. After that it was tough but not life-threatening. Somewhere on the ensuing long half-walk, half-crawl through spiky undergrowth and tangled trees, I realised that my stick – and my underwear – had disappeared. I was not going back for them.  Every so often, as I continued up through dense thickets, I stumbled on what looked like the remnants of paths. These would always lead in the direction I needed – but sadly didn’t last for long. I rejoiced when one of the longest and clearest bits of track started near the top and took me all the way up to the summit.  Jane Cochrane takes a break on a walk across Ithaca in the footsteps of Odysseus. Photograph: Nigel Summerley  I am convinced there was once a network of paths here, used by farmers going from the plain to the spring and the sea and back. A fit ancient Ithacan could have bounded up Korakos Petra in much less than the two hours 25 minutes it took me. Young Telemachus could definitely have done it.  Jane firmly advises others not to follow my example; her guidebook includes a safer but longer way of exploring this area, plus a dozen other walks that we checked together. She gives maps and instructions for getting to the beach at Dexia, where Odysseus finally came ashore; up to the Cave of the Nymphs, where he hid the treasure he returned with; south across the island to the plain where his livestock grazed; to the cave where Eumaeus spent nights guarding his herd from wild dogs; all the way north to the Mycenaean remains of the Palace of Odysseus; and down from there to the Melanhydros springs whose waters Penelope and her maids might have used.  Along the way her book encounters 19th-century archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who barked up the wrong hill in the 1870s; pioneering Sylvia Benton discovering wonderful things in the 1930s; and wife-and-husband archaeologists Litsa and Thanasis Papadopoulos excavating and finally identifying the Palace of Odysseus in 2010. Jane is the latest in a long line of Ithacan heroes … and it was an honour to be with her for this latest part of the island’s journey through history.  Walking in the Footsteps of Odysseus (£9.99) can be ordered at janeocochrane.co.uk. The author will be in conversation about the book on 28 April, 6.30pm, at Paddington Library, London.

Russia’s president summoned the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and military chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, to a public meeting on Sunday and ordered them to “transfer the deterrence forces” – a reference to nuclear weapons – “of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty”.  Do Putin’s words have any specific military meaning?  Although the diplomatic threat was clear enough, the exact phrasing confused nuclear experts and defence ministries, who did not recognise what a “special mode of combat duty” might specifically entail. But there was agreement that the threat, though it had gone up a notch, remained at a low level.  Pavel Podvig, widely considered a leading expert on Russian nuclear forces, tweeted that that Putin’s order “most likely” meant “the nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command”. This would turn the system on, in effect, allowing “a launch order” to “go through if issued”.  It would also allow, he wrote, for the nuclear weapons to be launched “if the president is taken out or can not be reached”, but he added, only in the case “it detects actual nuclear detonations on the Russian territory”.  David Cullen, of the Nuclear Information Service, said this was, in a way, “analogous to the British system”, where the commanders of Trident nuclear submarines are given letters of last resort, signed by the prime minister, of instructions on how to act if it is believed that the UK has been destroyed by an all-out nuclear attack.  Both Podvig and other experts, such as James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment, said Putin’s order could also entail further operational changes. That could include sending further nuclear armed submarines to sea or dispersing long range nuclear missiles around Russian territory, from where they could theoretically be used.  But that may not necessarily be the case, Podvig added, given Putin’s phrasing was deliberately ambiguous.  What is the thinking of western governments?  Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, said the UK did not recognise the terms Putin used. “That is not a term that is in their doctrine,” the minister told the BBC on Monday morning. The move was, he said, designed to scare the west and “remind the world he’s got a deterrent” and that it was a distraction designed to ensure that the west was “talking about it rather than the lack of success they are having in Ukraine”.  The defence secretary also warned Russia could, in theory, use so-called tactical nuclear weapons in the fight against Ukraine. But this would amount to a massive – and still unlikely – escalation against what Putin has described as “one people” with Russians.  “They could be every bit as powerful as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs; most people say there is no such thing as a non-strategic nuclear weapon,” said Sebastian Brixey-Williams, a co-director of the Basic thinktank.  Has Russia said anything more since Sunday to explain itself?  There was a signal, from the Kremlin itself, on Monday that its statement was primarily a form of high stakes diplomacy. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the decision came in response to various western warnings there could be “collisions and clashes between Nato and Russia”. He added: “I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister.”  Matthew Harries, a nuclear specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said the statements were a warning of a different sort. It was, in the first instance, simple intimidation – “we can hurt you, and fighting us is dangerous” – and a reminder to the west, which is increasingly arming the Ukrainians, not to go too far. “It could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a ‘keep out’ warning to the west,” he said.

Social media has long been instrumental in distributing frontline footage, but Ukraine presents a new scale of global conflict for private platforms to navigate.  Tech companies are facing a constant stream of mis- and disinformation, propaganda from Russian-backed outlets, violent content, and on-the-ground footage of fleeing refugees, causing world leaders and tech watchdogs to call for greater accountability and transparency in how companies wield their powerful platforms.  Ukrainian officials last week pleaded with US tech giants to take action against Russia, urging them to restrict access to their services within Russia, more forcefully curtail the spread of misinformation, and crack down on Russian state-backed outlets.  “In 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, said in a letter to Tim Cook asking the Apple CEO to cut off Russia’s access to the App Store.  Over the weekend, the prime ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia sent a joint letter to the chief executives of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, urging them to proactively suspend accounts denying, glorifying or justifying wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  “Although the online platforms have undertaken significant efforts to address the Russian government’s unprecedented assault on truth, they have not done enough,” they said in the letter.  They also urged the companies to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries’ leadership and their associates that routinely disseminate false information about the invasion.  Some platforms have taken heed. Twitter said that on 27 February it had permanently suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked some content that violated its “manipulation and spam” policy. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, spoke with EU officials on Sunday to discuss how to better crack down on misinformation.  Meta, which owns Facebook, has barred Russian state-run media from selling ads on its platforms and removed networks of accounts spreading misinformation. Its vice-president Nick Clegg tweeted on Monday it had restricted access to the Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik across the EU, following requests from a number of governments and the EU.  Clegg also said Meta would continue to label and factcheck these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetize their accounts globally.  But some argue this is not enough. Although Facebook said in October 2019 it would start “labelling state-controlled media on their Page and in our Ad Library”, as part of efforts against disinformation targeting US elections, a study released on Friday by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed Facebook was failing to label 91% of posts containing Russian propaganda about Ukraine.  “Facebook has once again fallen short on their promises to enforce their own rules,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “The justification for the Russian war against Ukraine was built on Facebook.”  An activist group monitoring Facebook policy that calls itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board called on the platform to take “more aggressive action” to stop the spread of misinformation.  The group has called on Meta cut off Russian state-funded media entirely and proactively suspend accounts justifying wars of aggression. It also requested more information about how many resources Facebook was dedicating to content moderation in Russia and Ukraine, including in local languages.  Others have called for more direct government intervention in how tech companies handle Russia. The Biden administration should issue clear sanctions preventing American digital media firms from – at the very least – doing business with and monetizing Russian state accounts, said Justin Hendrix, the CEO and editor of the non-profit democracy and technology media venture Tech Policy press.  “This is war, and the lies and falsehoods that the Russian state media and Putin’s officials will share in the next days across American social media platforms are weapons intended to legitimize the Kremlin’s brutality, divide Ukraine’s allies and diminish any potential opposition,” he said.

Everybody does it, but we’d rather not think about it, and avoid discussing it unless we have to. In new docuseries Wasteland (now streaming on Paramount Plus), director Elisa Gambino informs us in no uncertain terms that we do have to, and isn’t hesitant about showing us why.  “The philosophy for us was to try to present poop in a serious way, which is hard, because it’s so easy to slip into potty humor,” Gambino said over the phone during a stopover in Montana. “But we wanted to look at poop and how it affects environmental justice, to treat it with seriousness without being so serious that people can’t watch it. You try to find a middle ground.”  Fecal matter represents a clear and present danger to that most precious human right of access to clean water, contaminating natural sources like streams and bubbling up into bathtubs and sinks due to faulty septic infrastructures. In choosing to shed fresh light on this vital, oft-ignored topic, Gambino faced an unsavory predicament. How much depiction is too much? Can something be too gross for TV? (There were times when she wasn’t sure she’d make it, developing headaches from the potent stenches along with her husband and director of photography Neal Broffman.) She didn’t want to shortchange just how abject some of this spillage and seepage could be, but at the same time, she understood that viewers have their limits. Like the rickety, untended pipes leaking bacteria into the water supply, people can only take so much shit before hitting a breaking point.  “The episodes are quite beautiful,” she says. “They’re cinematic. We tried to create a feeling of all-is-well, where on the surface, flowers are blooming and corn is growing. But then there’s a theme of the underlying. Some people have said this looks too good to be about poop … The whole year I spent working on this, I divided my friends into two groups: the ones that would let me talk to them about the series and politely listen, and the ones who would just look at me and then change the subject, or walk away. I was happy on Thursday, when it premiered and I could say, ‘Look! I was really doing something! I wasn’t just talking about poop!’ Now, I don’t have to talk about poop so much. But I can’t flush the toilet or turn on the faucet without thinking about it.”  For the resilient souls featured in Gambino’s series, excrement isn’t something to think about, but a terrible fact of daily life. Each of the four episodes concentrates on the hazards of contamination in a different state, as onscreen reporter and executive producer Adam Yamaguchi interviews the public works officials, activists and ordinary folks caught up in the vast impact of this ecological quagmire. In Alabama, Lowndes county falls within the predominantly African American Black Belt,and the specters of centuries-old racism still wreak secondhand havoc on the underserved population. Just outside New York City’s limits, the people of Mount Vernon share horror stories of brown geysers pumping their homes full of raw sewage. Down in southwest Florida, septic tanks have caused lethal “algal blooms” that wipe out fish and other regional fauna while rendering water unsafe to drink. And in Iowa, the booming pig-farming industry generates more manure than anyone knows what to do with, and locals pay the price in cancer.  Across each case, the constant is the insidious way that institutional neglect ripples out to create personal consequences. “I think sometimes too much responsibility is put on individuals, and we don’t think enough about the cause,” Gambino says. “In Alabama, people are responsible for their own septic system and they get absolutely no help. We’re always telling people to recycle their plastic at the cost of thinking about who’s making the plastic. People think it’s an individual choice to live in a house with a septic tank, but it’s not. This is everybody’s problem. We need to look at the legislation in Iowa that’s not serving the people. Infrastructure money needs to go to Mount Vernon and released to the people once received. It’s not just the collapsing pipes, it’s people doing things to make this job so much harder.”  Without funding or the staff it would pay for, Mount Vernon Public Works Commissioner Damani Bush has no choice but to rush around town, plugging up each successive calamity like he’s jamming corks into one big sinking ship. Over and over, we’re shown how natural and human-made factors combine to leave our most vulnerable in jeopardy. One might sense a feeling of futility creeping on as they watch, as if the Earth has begun rejecting us and we’re powerless to stop it, but the truth is that there’s still plenty to be done. In Alabama, laws long since out-of-date hold the towns of Lowndes county down as much as any inevitabilities from the changing climate. The state has largely left the low-income community of mostly Black residents to fend for themselves in the fight for even the most basic creature comforts of modern life.  “In the episode about Alabama, Dr Robinson talks about how following the civil rights movement, there was a lot of hope for people across the Black Belt that they’d find new prosperity,” Gambino says. “Every tool was used to make sure this didn’t happen. These systems that they rely on, the expensive systems of engineering – they’re left on their own to maintain them after they’ve been purchased. There isn’t even insurance available, where you can pay monthly and then be all right if your septic tank breaks. We have it for cars and homes, and this is sanitation, no less important. In Mount Vernon, people might look at an all-Black leadership and think that it can’t be an issue of racism, because look at local government. But the problems are so baked-in that they existed long before this change, divided by old racisms. I just want people to walk away with something to think about.”  While Gambino has accepted that the oncoming deluge of sewage represents a problem too vast for any of us to take on, her film nonetheless leaves us with a call to action. All we can do is hold lawmakers’ feet to the flames in our demands to adjust the laws, as in Iowa, where something as simple as a stricter ordinance against spraying manure on frozen ground could make a planet of difference. “Legislators have concrete knowledge of what needs to be done to address these problems,” Gambino says, “but there’s no will among the legislators to do anything.”  The structuring absence would seem to be the emergency conditions in Flint, Michigan, the most high-profile battleground in the fight for clean, non-contaminated water. But Gambino has observed a simplifying effect in how the public processes information that often places Flint at the forefront of this dialogue, as if we prefer to mentally constrain the sewage to a single location. The unfortunate truth, however, is that it’s everywhere. America is drowning in a vast sea of it, and we can’t afford to deny it any longer. If this feels like a stomach-turning thing to think about, just consider how much more visceral the response will be once it’s happening in your own home.  “Not to take anything away from Flint, that’s so important right now, but the focus on it has sometimes kept us from looking at other places as well,” she says. “There are millions of people across the United States with non-potable water. It’s like Commissioner Bush says – this is a nationwide problem. We didn’t even get into the situations with the Navajo Nation, for instance, or West Virginia. It’s happening everywhere.”

Europe sleep-walked into a huge conflict over 100 years ago, which also had had enormous consequences for China,” Xu said. “The world may be at the point of no return again”.  But looking at how Chinese diplomats are responding to it, and how Chinese people have talked about it on social media in the past week, he said, “I’m afraid it seems we still have not learned the lessons of the past tragedies. As a historian I’m very disappointed.”  On Saturday morning, five renowned Chinese historians – Xu included – wrote an open letter denouncing Russia’s action on its neighbour and calling for peace. The authors of the letter hope to persuade Beijing to make its stance clearer: that what Russia is doing is wrong, and China should say it out loud.  “What will this war lead to? Will it lead to a large-scale world war?” the historians asked. “Great catastrophes in history often started with local conflicts... We strongly opposed Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of a sovereign state by force … is a violation of the norms of international relations based on the United Nations charter and a breach of the existing international security system.”  In public, China opposes any act that violates territorial integrity. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, articulated this position again in a late-night post published on his ministry’s website on Friday. But over the course of the past week, as civilians were killed and western sanctions intensified, Beijing continued to echo Putin’s argument that Moscow’s action is a response to Nato’s eastward expansion.  As Chinese historians, we do not wish to see China being dragged into something that will fundamentally harm the current world order Xu Guoqi  “Do they genuinely believe in that? Is it worth [it] for China to undermine its own credibility to defend the indefensible? I’m afraid they were fooled by Putin,” Xu said, emphasising that he and his colleagues wrote this letter because they love the country, and they do not wish a potential worldwide tragedy to stall China’s future.  “This is simply a black and white matter,” he continued. “This is an invasion. As the Chinese saying goes: you cannot call a deer a horse. As Chinese historians, we do not wish to see China being dragged into something that will fundamentally harm the current world order. For the love of mankind, world peace and development, we should make this clear.”  But Xu and his colleagues’ open letter was quickly taken down by internet censors after two hours and 40 minutes online. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, pro-war Chinese trolls denounced the authors – who are based in Nanjing, Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai – as “shameful” and “traitorous”. “Why did you not say anything during the west’s invasion in Iraq,” one quipped sarcastically.  Is Beijing changing its thinking?  It is difficult to gauge the public opinion in China, but in the past few days, while Beijing’s diplomats struggle with a coherent argument, many Chinese nationalists expressed their admiration of Putin online. Some called the Russian leader “the greatest strategist of this century”. Others said China should leverage the current situation to “take Taiwan back”.  But at the same time, censors are not taking down all anti-war posts, either. On WeChat, for example, many have also been discussing the situation in Ukraine. On Sunday, as Putin ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, some users posted a 1994 statement in which China urged all nuclear-weapon states not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against states that do not have them, including Ukraine.  On social media, some of those who are against Russia’s action are also speaking out – although they are often met with pro-war trolls who accuse them of being “weak” and “naive”. “If Russia has issues with Nato, it should deal with Nato, why invade Ukraine?” one questioned in a WeChat video that attracted over half a million views in a span of hours. Nearly 9,000 users liked the video and more than 23,000 shared it.  There is a long history of Chinese intellectuals speaking out, individually or collectively, on major domestic and international issues, including in ways that challenge official policies, said Prof Jeff Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California, Irvine. “Sometimes the risks involved are small but at other points it is truly daring to engage in this time-honoured practice.”  But Wasserstrom said the five prominent Chinese historians’ letter was particularly noticeable because of the tightening of the freedom of speech on Chinese campuses – both on the mainland and in Hong Kong - in recent years. Several high-profile Chinese academics have been barred from teaching.  As the war intensifies, there are signs that Beijing may be changing its thinking. On Friday, China abstained at the end of the UN security council vote condemning the Russian aggression. Western diplomats saw this as a sign that Beijing is increasingly uneasy at being seen as defending Putin’s action, which has drawn worldwide condemnation.  On Sunday, the Chinese envoy to Kyiv, Fan Xianrong, stressed in a video address that China respected Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He also urged Ukraine-based Chinese nationals not to reveal their identity or display any signs of their nationality, reversing his embassy’s earlier advisory that encouraged citizens to stick the national flag on their cars.  “Sooner or later, they’ll have to come to [their] senses,” Xu said. “The Chinese are very pragmatic. They need to understand they are a big beneficiary of the current world order, under which China also prospered. This is an opportunity for all of us to demonstrate we are a real responsible stakeholder.”

Since Sunday, however, he has been sticking rubber bands and plastic tops on to homemade bombs. “It’s practical history. It’s time for this right now,” he explained, loading another molotov cocktail into a crate.  Around him, about a dozen students and young creative professionals stood around a makeshift table. All wore masks and washing-up gloves. Each had a role in a busy production line. The basement bomb factory smelled strongly of petrol and paint remover – two molotov ingredients, along with polystyrene and silver dust.  Mediakovskyi – who is 20 – said his mother had woken him early last Thursday to tell him Russia had invaded Ukraine. “I knew it was going to start. My hands started shaking,” he said. After spending a day doom-scrolling on social media, he decided he would try to help.  “My parents know I’m volunteering. I haven’t told my granny. She’s worried enough about things already,” he admitted. He acknowledged that a molotov wouldn’t stop the mighty Russian army. But he stressed: “It will break Russian soldiers mentally, and show them they are not welcome here.”  The basement bomb factory smelled strongly of petrol.  One of the molotovs fell off the table-top and smashed. The team cleared off for 10 minutes, allowing time for the noxious fumes to disperse. A ground-floor window had been propped open to improve ventilation. Outside, snow fell.  Vladimir Putin’s campaign to seize and subjugate Ukraine has gone less well than the Kremlin might have hoped. Five days on, the Ukrainian army has fought back, blowing up Russian military convoys and deploying defensive weapons – some supplied by the US and UK – to devastating effect. Kyiv and other key cities have not fallen.  At the same time, an army of civilian volunteers have been contributing to the war effort amid an unprecedented upsurge in patriotic feeling. They have donated food, offered accommodation to people forced to flee from bombardment, and have weaved camouflage military nets while singing songs.  In Lviv, a former industrial complex used as a creative hub and rave space has been transformed into an improvised molotov factory. In one corner of the basement are stacks of bottles, some bearing stickers saying: “Apple juice, 1997”. In another, flowery linen squares, to be torn into strips and used as fuses.  “We call them Bandera smoothies,” Lily Eleanor, a 25-year-old PR for fashion brands said, referring to the Ukrainian wartime nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. How did she cope with the pungent working conditions? “I love the smell. It’s the smell of freedom. The Russians don’t know what they are doing here,” she said.  The volunteers – aged 18 to 35 – packed the finished molotovs into car boots, around 1,500 of them a day. They are then distributed via a trusted network of contacts, with some held in reserve in case Russia tries to seize Lviv. Tips on how to throw them at an invading enemy tank are swapped via Instagram and Facebook.  Yuliia Oliinyk, 23, said she had little sympathy for Russian conscripts her age or younger sent to fight in Ukraine, some of whom have been captured. “I’m a student of international relations. It’s really good preparation for bomb-making,” she joked. Ukraine had tried hard to find a diplomatic solution to avoid war, she said.  Olinnyk said that as well as making bombs she had taken classes in knife-fighting, grenade throwing and first aid. These skills were necessary because Ukraine had already spent eight years fighting Moscow and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas. “Unfortunately, Russia is a part of our neighbourhood,” she said.  In normal times the bomb-making factory is home to creative businesses: production studios, artists, and tattoo parlours. It now houses refugees on the fifth floor, camped out on mattresses next to arc lights and a print of Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can artwork. On the ground floor is a cafe and drop-off point for clothes donations.  Few of the young people making molotovs had ever thrown one. Bohdan Zhelobchuk, a user experience designer, said he had chucked a home-made bomb in 2014 in Kyiv, during the Maidan uprising against the country’s then pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. “We made some cocktails back then. We started producing them again on Friday,” he said.  According to the Kyiv Independent news site, one of Lviv’s breweries had shifted production from beer to bombs. “Pravda Brewery team is hand-bottling today. It’s a very special bottling. So many people willing to help. We’ll bottle beer later,” one of the brewery’s employees, Yuri Zastavny, posted on Facebook.  Rodion Kadatskyi – a 25-year-old IT project manager from Mariupol – said not everybody was able to pick up a weapon and fight. Making bombs was another way of helping, he said. “The youth are moved by this patriotic spirit. Everyone now realises what he or she is capable of doing.”

Here are some of the measures adopted by the US, EU and UK, with countries including Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand all taking similar steps:  Finance and economy  The EU, US, UK and Canada have agreed to prevent the Russian central bank from deploying its €640bn (£540bn) of international reserves “in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions”.  The EU has banned all transactions with the institution. The US has done the same, and added the Russian finance ministry and national wealth fund. The Russian state has, in effect, been banned from raising sovereign debt; shares of Russian state-owned entities may no longer be listed on EU stock exchanges.  A range of Russian banks – their names have not yet been announced – are also being cut out of the Swift international payments system by the EU, US, UK and Canada. Brussels has said this will “stop them from operating worldwide, and effectively block Russian exports and imports”.  The US has placed Russia’s top 10 financial institutions, representing about 80% of the country’s banking sector, under restrictions, including cutting off the biggest – Sberbank, which accounts for about 30% of Russian banking – and its subsidiaries from conducting transactions through the US system.  The assets of many other Russian banks, including VTB, the country’s second largest, Bank Rossiya and Promsvyazbank, have also been hit with strict asset freezes and/or new business restrictions in the EU, UK, US and elsewhere.  Individuals  The foreign assets of the Russian president, his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, have been frozen in the EU, US and UK, as have those of the FSB security head, Alexander Bortnikov, the armed forces chief, Valery Gerasimov, and members of the Kremlin’s security council. The EU has imposed sanctions on all 351 members of Russia’s parliament, the Duma; the US and UK are punishing selected members as are Australia, Japan and New Zealand.  More than a dozen billionaire oligarchs with ties to Putin’s regime, including Andrey Patrushev (oil company Rosneft), Petr Fradkov (Promsvyazbank), Yury Slyusar (United Aircraft), Boris Rotenberg (gas pipeline company SMP), Denis Bortnikov (VTB bank) and Kirill Shamalov, ex-husband of Putin’s daughter Katarina, are on asset freeze and travel ban lists around the world. The US is also sanctioning top state-owned bank executives from VTB and Sberbank. Canada and Australia have also imposed sanctions on multiple oligarchs.  The UK has imposed a £50,000 limit on bank accounts held by Russian nationals in the UK), and the EU a limit of €100,000 in EU banks.  Industry and transport  Russian airlines and private jets have been progressively banned from UK and EU airspace and the US is considering similar action but has yet to make a final decision. Aeroflot has said it will cancel all flights to European destinations; multiple European airlines have said they are halting routes to Russia.  The US has in effect banned the Russian energy company Gazprom, the oil pipeline company Transneft, and the power company RusHydro, as well as the country’s biggest freight, rail and telecoms companies, from its credit markets.  The EU has introduced a ban on exports of aircraft and aviation parts to Russia, as well as exports of hi-tech goods including semiconductors, computers, telecoms and information security equipment and sensors. UK and EU-based companies are also banned from exporting to a wide range of Russian defence, naval, transport and communications companies, including the infamous Internet Research Agency troll farm in St Petersburg.

Gas extractors burn off excess condensate in the Russian Arctic tundra. The practice, called ‘flaring’, is harmful to the environment.  In recent decades, as scientists discover billions of tons of additional oil and gas trapped underneath the Arctic tundra, the Kremlin has commanded Russian energy companies to usurp these strategic resources.  Engineers and miners from around the world work short stints in the region, looking for natural wealth deposits several kilometres below the tundra. They come with expensive, sophisticated equipment and earn substantial sums for their hardship tours.  Engineers work surrounded by ice at a gas-drilling site in Novy Urengoy.  Workers connecting gas pipes during the night; and spraying steam over operating pipelines to stop them freezing on a cold morning when the temperature dropped to -42C.  An overview of Novy Urengoi, a city built by Gazprom in the 1980s to exploit some of the world’s largest gas fields.  The Ice City in Novy Urengoy.  When I was living in Moscow in 2009, the former Guardian journalist Tom Parfitt and I took a train towards the north pole for an adventure. The landscape grew desolate as the train headed towards darkness during the 40-hour journey; the trees shrank, and then disappeared all together when we reach the end of the line.  Unused to the polar cold, I was knocked over by a snow blizzard, my knees buckling under the weight of my backpack that I could not lift across the snow. I screamed with pain as frostbite attacked my fingers and toes; it was later I realised that numbness was far worse.  Bashneft, an oil and gas company, arrives with its workers and containers (left, in blue) after an attempt by a rival exploration firm was abandoned (right, covered in snow). Bashneft plans to build a gas well here in the Nenets autonomous region.  One day, while trudging through the snow, I stumbled on the edge of town upon rows and rows of white containers, which appeared grey under the piles of snow. Inside, geologists, truck drivers and technicians plotted the day’s search for natural gas. I entered uninvited.  A colony is set up in the tundra, hundreds of kilometres from civilisation, to prospect for oil and gas; lightbulbs are delivered to a colony drilling outpost; the cooks are the only females on site and typically stay for the entire winter.  Sitting at the end of this corridor of joined-up containers, 58-year-old Igor commanded 100 men by phone and walkie talkie in search of the gaseous treasure. His company used trucks fitted with seismic radar to scan the Earth’s crust for fossil deposits. They are the frontline explorers, the wild north pioneers.  Igor, a stern, chain-smoking boss, must have felt sorry for me when I knocked on his cubicle door. A lone foreigner, struggling with Russian, covered in snow, I looked and felt miserable. He offered me tea, and I asked if I could follow and photograph his men in search of gas.  “If you really want,” Igor said, without expression. “Our snow truck leaves tonight for a gas field an eight-hour drive away. There is a spare seat, but don’t expect any sleep”.  A boxy orange vehicle with doughnut wheels taller than me took us bouncing across the tundra to an ungodly cold and dark patch of nowhere. All around you could hear the sound of hissing, then loud whirls, as workers sprayed the gas tanks with hot steam to prevent them from freezing.  My real journey into the Arctic had begun.  Tents, or ‘chums’, belonging to Nentsi herders stand in the Arctic tundra.  A Nentsi herder rounds up his reindeer in -40C conditions. The reindeer meat is sold to sausage factories; the antlers to China for use as a traditional medicine.  Workers test a drilling rig at a gas field in the delta of the Pechora river, 37 miles from Naryan-Mar city. In 1979, an explosion in one of the wells polluted the surrounding tundra, including the Pechora river. After another explosion it closed in 1981, was designated a nature reserve, a status removed in 2007 by decree so drilling for newly discovered gas could resume, a move condemned by environmentalists.  In this region, contrasting ways of life simultaneously exploit resources amid the world’s harshest conditions. For hundreds of years, this part of the Russian Arctic was home only to the Nenets, who raise reindeer for meat and have benefited from an uptick in demand for antlers, which are now sold as an aphrodisiac in China.  Every winter, workers build ice roads in the tundra to serve gas and oil companies; and every summer, the roads melt away into marshland.  When the Soviet government tried to force these nomads into collective farms, some were re-settled in apartment blocks, abruptly altering their way of life. Mounted jet aircraft stand sentry over cities used and abused by the Soviet government, and descendants of Stalin’s prisons populate the streets.  A war monument stands above Murmansk, the world’s largest Arctic city and a vital industrial and shipping hub. Close to the borders of Finland and Norway, the city became an important military base during the cold war.  Though the gulags were abandoned in the 1950s after Stalin’s death, many former inmates chose to stay. The Soviet government built housing blocks and communities for those who worked in the mines, and used high salaries to attract newcomers. The area boomed, for a while, but the regime scarred the once-pristine land with giant sinkholes and pollutants.  Vorkuta is a coalmining and former gulag town 1,200 miles north-east of Moscow, beyond the Arctic Circle, where winter temperatures drop to -50C. Here, whole villages are being slowly deserted and reclaimed by snow, while financial difficulties squeeze mining companies that already struggle to find workers.  Only one family is left living in this apartment block on the edge of Vorkuta.  Nina Merzlikina, 75, and Sergei Kostenko, 45, have packed up their belongings at their apartment in Vorkuta as they wait to be evicted. Local officials want to close the village on the city outskirts so that they can shut off its supply of gas and electricity.  When the Soviet Union collapsed, mines and factories closed, blighting a generation in the Arctic region with poverty and alcoholism. Many fled to seek a future; those who chose to stay often don’t work, age rapidly and die young.  Simyon, a reindeer herder, travels by sled from his chum towards Vorkuta to buy supplies; Karp, a coalminer, walks through Yor Shor, an abandoned village near Vorkuta, where he is among the last 10 inhabitants.  Valery, a miner and union representative in Severny village outside Vorkuta, is comforted by his partner, Lena.  The Russian government is again conquering the far north to stake its dominance.  This crucial period fascinates me so much that I have been back to the Arctic and Siberian region 10 times in the last decade, each time getting to know more of the story and pushing my body and my cameras to their limits.  The Lukoil terminal, off Russia’s Arctic shore, is the world’s most northerly oil terminal, according to Guinness World Records. It serves tankers using the Arctic route between Europe and Asia, and is another step in Russia’s push towards the north pole. The two ships are ice-breakers that work around the clock.  A Lukoil worker repairs a leaking pipe in the Komi region.  From that first day meeting Igor, I have got to know the Arctic and its people well and learned to capture its essence through photography.  The Russian military have granted me unprecedented access to photograph strategic zones, energy companies commission me to photograph their technology, and Igor no longer sees me as that lost foreigner who came to the Arctic without a plan.  They know I’m now here to depict energy politics’ coldest battle front.

About 20 people were queued in line. “Yesterday [the rate] was 80 [to the dollar]. Today it’s 100. Or 150.”  “I just made a spontaneous decision today that I would ask [out of work] and go around until I took out all my money,” he said. “Before it was worth zero.”  Within minutes, however, the word traveled down the queue: the dollars were gone.  Nearly half the queue walked off. “Who needs roubles?” one woman said sarcastically as she walked away.  From shopping malls to corporate boardrooms, Russians were trying to find their footing on Monday in what the Kremlin described as the “altered economic reality” that the country was now facing following sanctions on Russia’s Central Bank and other key financial institutions. There were signs that something extraordinary was taking place: the Moscow Exchange, Russia’s largest stock market, has halted trading until 5 March.  With its reserves frozen, the Central Bank announced it would more than double its main interest rates to 20%, the highest this century, and force major exporting companies, including large energy producers like Gazprom and Rosneft, to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues, effectively buying roubles to prop up the currency rate.  But that did little to calm the frayed nerves at the Metropolis Mall in Moscow, where there were signs that Russians were rushing to turn their cash into consumer goods before prices leapt up. At an M.Video, a popular electronics store, one employee said that rouble prices for iPhones were “the same for now” but that “they could change any minute.” “I’d buy now,” he said.  If there was shock on the streets, then the mood among the business community was even more dour. Several owners of mid-sized companies said that the invasion and subsequent isolation of Russia had made their businesses unprofitable overnight.  One, the owner of an advertising services company with 100 employees, said that he was about to announce to his employees this afternoon that he is leaving the country for Armenia with his wife and two sons.  “I’m going to tell them that we are going into a crisis that we have never experienced before,” he said. “It’s like flying on a plane with no engines or the engines are on fire.”  His company, which handles contracts for international brands like Pepsi and automakers like Volkswagen, was booming as recently as January 2022, a record month for them. Now many of those brands were pulling out of the Russian market and his business was shrinking “immensely”.  Another business owner with hundreds of employees in the food and beverage and tourism industries felt that he was completely in the dark about the future under Vladimir Putin.  “We have no fucking clue what he will do next,” he said. “No one in the business community has a clue any more. Everyone is so depressed. I have experienced so many economic crises here, the pandemic being the latest.  “But there was always a reason to keep on fighting for your business,” he said. “Now, I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel any more. Even if peace is achieved, the damage is done. How do we reverse it?”  There was a sense on Monday that this crisis was passing the point of no return, as Russian bombers began flying over Ukraine and rocket artillery began firing on populated districts of Kharkiv, a city of more than one million people.  Even top Russian business people, including the powerful oligarchs, appeared to be unsettled by the instability ushered in by the invasion, as well as the extraordinary measures being taken to prop up the rouble.  Oleg Deripaska, the billionaire businessman, had called for peace “as fast as possible” in a Telegram post on Sunday. On Monday, he went after the Central Bank decision to hike rates, taking aim at longtime rival Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Central Bank.  “A hiked rate, the mandatory sale of foreign currency … this is the first test of who actually will be responsible for this banquet,” Deripaska wrote. “I really want clarifications and intelligible comments on the economic policy of the next three months.”  By the evening, the answer was even more draconian measures, including strict limits on transfers of money abroad. Those were announced after a funereal meeting between economic officials and Vladimir Putin, who declared that the sanctions had been imposed by the western “empire of lies”.  For many Russians, who felt themselves to be European by the food they ate and the way they lived, it’s clear that Monday marked a moment when the war came home.  “I think people are going to feel scared to spend money,” said the entrepreneur who owns restaurants and tourism companies. “We have left communism 30 years ago, we got accustomed to having a lot of comforts that are also seen in the West. All of that progress can be gone. We are no longer a member of the international community.”

The scheme will be widened so that anyone who is an adult parent, grandparent, child over 18 or sibling of a Ukrainian national living in the UK can apply to join them.  A new visa sponsor route will also be created to let British businesses bring Ukrainians to the UK.  The change was announced by No 10, with Priti Patel due to give more details in a Commons statement later on Tuesday afternoon. The home secretary is expected to maintain her rejection of demands to offer a full visa waiver to all Ukrainians who want to escape conflict and come to the UK.  The approximate number of Ukrainians expected to be covered will rise to 200,000, given it includes the original 100,000 people the Home Office identified as immediate family members – a definition that was criticised by Tory MPs and others for being too narrow.  Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said the figures were “indicative only”.  He said: “Obviously it’s impossible to predict the exact scale of Ukrainians settled and how many will want to make that journey, how many will be brought across, but we think it is right to have that open offer that they can bring loved ones and be reunited with them, should they wish to make that journey.  “Obviously, in the first instance, we know that a large number will be in and around the borders of Ukraine and understandably those who live in Ukraine will will want to return as soon as it’s safe to do so. But for those that do wish to come to the UK to be reunited with those settled here, we will facilitate that.”  Ukrainians with no relatives will still not automatically be allowed to travel to the UK.  Pressed on why the UK had not matched the EU’s offer of granting Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, the prime minister’s spokesman said ministers had already set out a “a broad and generous offer” that would allow “significant numbers” of people to come to the UK.  He also stressed the need to conduct background and security checks on all those applying for visas. “They’re a fundamental part of our visa approval process, and they will continue,” the spokesperson said.  “We do also have a responsibility to British citizens to ensure that we’re helping those in genuine need, given the intelligence and information we have about some of the activities of those who may be seeking to do this country harm.”  Earlier, Johnson said the UK was willing to take “considerable numbers” of Ukrainian refugees.  He told a press conference in Poland of those trying to flee the invasion of Russian forces: “We in the UK stand ready to help you. We have humanitarian supplies, as you know, already coming in. I think two planes of medical supplies have already landed. there’s more to come.  “And we stand ready, clearly, to take Ukrainian refugees in our own country, working with you, in considerable numbers, as we always have done, and always will.”  It comes after dozens of Conservative MPs wrote to Johnson after the initial tranche of 100,000 visas were announced, urging the prime minister to “go further and act jointly with other European countries and share responsibility with them”.  The group urged ministers to “seek a flexible and pragmatic approach to those Ukrainians wishing to seek temporary refuge in the UK until it is safe to return to their lives in their home country” and added: “It is clear that this is not another migration crisis; this is a crisis of war.  “This should not be business as usual, we need sincere and immediate support for the Ukrainian people. The United Kingdom cannot flag or fail, our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome.”

The parties do not intend for any third party to have any rights under this Agreement by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.  18.4. A party shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that this failure or delay is the direct result of a Force Majeure Event, provided that the Affected Party has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or overcome that failure. If the Force Majeure Event prevents the Affected Party from materially complying with its obligations under this Agreement and it continues for more than 30 days, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice.  18.5.

He led the London Symphony Orchestra in New York in 2015.  Valery Gergiev, the star Russian maestro and prominent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was removed Tuesday from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  And Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva who is one of opera’s biggest international stars, saw her upcoming engagements with the Bavarian State Opera canceled, and the Zurich Opera House announced that she had withdrawn from her upcoming performances there. She too has ties to Mr. Putin, and was once pictured holding a flag used by some Russian-backed separatist groups in Ukraine.  Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, announced his decision about Mr. Gergiev and the Munich Philharmonic in a news release saying that terminating the contract was the only option available.  Mr. Gergiev’s abrupt dismissal, three years before his contract was set to expire, was the biggest setback yet for the conductor, who has been the target of widespread anger and condemnation in recent days for his long record of support for Mr. Putin and his policies.  Officials in Munich said that Mr. Gergiev, who had held the post of chief conductor since 2015, had failed to respond to a demand issued on Friday by Mr. Reiter that he condemn Mr. Putin’s “brutal war of aggression” by Monday or be fired.  The news release said that “with immediate effect, there will be no further concerts by the Munich Philharmonic” under Mr. Gergiev’s baton.  Mr. Reiter said in his statement that “I would have expected him to reconsider and revise his very positive assessment of Russia’s leader. He didn’t.”  Mr. Gergiev did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  The director of the Zurich Opera House, Andreas Homoki, noted that Ms. Netrebko had issued a statement over the weekend in which she said she opposed the war.  “We see this statement as a positive development, and take note that she cannot distance herself further from Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Homoki said in the statement. “As a matter of principle, we do not consider it appropriate to judge the decisions and actions of citizens of repressive regimes based on the perspective of those living in a Western European democracy.”  But he went on to note that the opera house’s “decisive condemnation” of Mr. Putin and his actions was “not compatible with Anna Netrebko’s public position.”  He said that Ms. Netrebko had decided not to sing in the upcoming performances, and that she had issued a statement saying: “This is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.”  After the cancellations were announced on Tuesday, Ms. Netrebko posted a picture on Instagram of herself with Mr. Gergiev smiling after a concert.  The Metropolitan Opera did not make any announcement regarding Ms. Netrebko’s scheduled appearances this spring, but Peter Gelb, its general manager, said in an interview on Tuesday that “The Met stands by its position that artists who support Putin are not going to be allowed to perform at the Met.” Before the Met performed Verdi’s “Don Carlos” on Monday evening, the company sang the Ukrainian national anthem.  The fast-moving events showed how quickly arts organizations around the world had moved to severe ties with Russia’s most prominent cultural ambassadors since the start of Mr. Putin’s invasion on Thursday.  Mr. Gergiev had lost a number of engagements in the days that followed, but the loss of his leadership position at the helm of a major European orchestra suggested much more serious ramifications for his international career.  It is a stunning turnaround for Mr. Gergiev, whose packed schedule and regular engagements with many of the world’s leading concert halls and opera houses has led the website Bachtrack, which collect statistics on classical music performances, to proclaim him the world’s busiest conductor in several recent seasons.  Image Mr. Gergiev’s support of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has led to protests in the past, including in 2014 when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall shortly before he became the orchestra’s chief conductor. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times  Mr. Gergiev is a prominent supporter of Mr. Putin, endorsing his re-election and appearing at concerts in Russia and abroad to promote his policies. The two have known each other since the early 1990s, when Mr. Putin was an official in St. Petersburg and Mr. Gergiev was beginning his tenure as the leader of the Mariinsky, then called the Kirov.  Mr. Putin has played an important role in Mr. Gergiev’s success, providing funding to the Mariinsky Theater, where Mr. Gergiev serves as general and artistic director.  His international engagements began drying up last week, when Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic dropped him from a series of performances. On Sunday, Mr. Gergiev’s manager announced he was ending his relationship with his client.  The manager, Marcus Felsner, said in a statement that it had become impossible to defend Mr. Gergiev, whom he described as “one of the greatest conductors of all time, a visionary artist loved and admired by many of us, who will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes.”  On Monday, the fallout continued, with the Verbier Festival in Switzerland saying it had asked for and accepted the resignation of Mr. Gergiev as music director of the festival’s orchestra. (The festival also said it would ban other artists who had shown support for Mr. Putin’s actions, and that it would return donations from individuals under sanctions from Western governments.)  The Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland, where Mr. Gergiev served as honorary president, also said Monday that he had resigned his position after being asked to do so. Philharmonie de Paris, a performing arts complex in France, announced it was canceling two concerts in April with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra. And the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland said it was canceling two performances in August with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky.  “In view of Russia’s acts of war in violation of international law, we are sending a clear signal of solidarity to the people of Ukraine,” Michael Haefliger, the festival’s executive and artistic director, said in a statement.  Shortly after the mayor of Munich announced his decision on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany — another major concert hall — said it, too, had canceled Mr. Gergiev’s future engagements. Several other institutions are considering similar moves, including the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and Teatro alla Scala, in Milan.  Alex Marshall contributed reporting.

The price of oil, natural gas and other staples spiked on Monday. At the same time, the groaning weight on supply chains, still laboring from the pandemic, rose as the United States, Europe and their allies tightened the screws on Russia’s financial transactions and froze hundreds of billions of dollars of the central bank’s assets that are held abroad.  Russia has long been a relatively minor player in the global economy, accounting for just 1.7 percent of the world’s total output despite its enormous energy exports. President Vladimir V. Putin has moved to further insulate it in recent years, building up a storehouse of foreign exchange reserves, reducing national debt and even banning cheese and other food imports from Europe.  But while Mr. Putin has ignored a slate of international norms, he cannot ignore a modern and mammoth financial system that is largely controlled by governments and bankers outside his country. He has mobilized tens of thousands of his troops, and, in response, allied governments have mobilized their vast financial power.

He has pored over reports about Ukrainians signing up for the military and scrutinized video footage of Russian missiles hitting residential buildings. He has been deeply disturbed by Russia’s brazen disregard for global norms.  But for Mr. Huang and many Taiwanese, Russia’s assault is hitting especially close to home.  The self-governed island democracy has long faced the threat of being absorbed by the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, which has vowed to do so by force if it deems necessary. As Taiwanese watch Russian troops pour into Ukraine, their unease about their island’s own future is growing. The courage of Ukrainians, as well as the harsh reality of that country’s lonely battle, has driven a greater sense of urgency among many Taiwanese to step up the island’s defenses.  “Reading the news has been a bit traumatic emotionally,” Mr. Huang said. Moved by a sense of solidarity with Ukraine, he and around 200 other people protested on Saturday outside Russia’s de facto embassy in Taipei. He said he feared that the invasion of Ukraine could be the “tipping point” in the world order, ushering in a new era in which autocrats could act with impunity.

The Russian military has taken no major cities, and video from Ukraine has shown scorched Russian vehicles and dead soldiers. Contrary to what President Vladimir Putin and his aides apparently expected — and what many Westerners feared — Ukraine’s government did not fall within a matter of days.  But military experts caution against confusing a war’s initial days with its likely result. Russia has now begun to use even more brutal tactics, including a bombardment of a residential area in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, home to universities and long considered a center of national culture. This morning, a large explosion hit the center of the city.  “We’re only in the opening days of this, and Putin has a lot of cards to play,” Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told The Times. “It’s too early to be triumphalist, and there are a lot of Russian capabilities not employed yet.”  The Russian military has an established strategy for taking over hostile cities, one it has used in both Syria and Chechnya. The strategy revolves around firing missiles and bombs into residential neighborhoods, both to destroy infrastructure and to terrify civilians into fleeing, before advancing into the city on the ground, as my colleague Steven Erlanger explains.

That gave the Russian government unfettered access.  Such attacks have given Russia a reputation as one of the most aggressive, and skilled, cyberpowers. But the surprise of recent days is that Russia’s activity in that realm has been more muted than expected, researchers said.  Most early tabletop exercises about a Russian invasion started with overwhelming cyberattacks, taking out the internet in Ukraine and perhaps the power grid. So far, that hasn’t happened.  “Many people are quite surprised that there isn’t significant integration of cyberattacks into the overall campaign that Russia is undertaking in Ukraine,” said Shane Huntley, the director of Google’s threat analysis group. “This is mostly business as normal as to the levels of Russian targeting.”  Mr. Huntley said Google regularly observes some Russian attempts to hack accounts of people in Ukraine. “The normal level is actually never zero,” he said. But those attempts have not markedly increased in the past several days, as Russia has invaded Ukraine.  “We have seen some Russian activity targeting Ukraine; it just hasn’t been the big sets,” said Ben Read, a director at the security firm Mandiant.  It is not clear to American or European officials why Russia held off.  It could be that they tried but defenses were stronger than they anticipated, or that the Russians wanted to reduce the risk of attacking civilian infrastructure, so that a puppet government they installed would not struggle to rule the country.

Putin himself — expected that the force would roll right in and the fighting would be over quickly. Instead, after five days of war, what appears to be unfolding is a Russian miscalculation about tactics and about how hard the Ukrainians would fight.  No major cities have been taken after an initial Russian push toward Kyiv, the capital, stalled. While Russia appeared to pull its punches, Ukraine marshaled and armed civilians to cover more ground, and its military has attacked Russian convoys and supply lines, leaving video evidence of scorched Russian vehicles and dead soldiers.  But the war was already changing quickly on Monday, and ultimately, it is likely to turn on just how far Russia is willing to go to subjugate Ukraine. The Russian track record in the Syrian civil war, and in its own ruthless efforts to crush separatism in the Russian region of Chechnya, suggest an increasingly brutal campaign ahead.

Putin of Russia, was removed Tuesday from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  And Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva who is one of opera’s biggest international stars, saw her upcoming engagements with the Bavarian State Opera canceled, and the Zurich Opera House announced that she had withdrawn from her upcoming performances there. She too has ties to Mr. Putin, and was once pictured holding a flag used by some Russian-backed separatist groups in Ukraine.  Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, announced his decision about Mr. Gergiev and the Munich Philharmonic in a news release saying that terminating the contract was the only option available.  Mr. Gergiev’s abrupt dismissal, three years before his contract was set to expire, was the biggest setback yet for the conductor, who has been the target of widespread anger and condemnation in recent days for his long record of support for Mr. Putin and his policies.

White House officials and their allies on Capitol Hill fear they could lose control of both chambers if Mr. Biden is unable to turn those numbers around.  “The president will absolutely use the word ‘inflation’ tomorrow,” Ms. Psaki said on Monday, calling it a “huge issue” on the minds of Americans.  Mr. Biden will urge Congress to embrace parts of his Build Back Better legislation, which passed in the House last year but stalled in the Senate amid opposition from two key moderate Democrats. Those portions include proposals to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on child care, elder care and prescription drugs.  The president, officials said, will argue that passage of the legislation will effectively counter the inflation that is affecting people’s everyday budgets. And Mr. Biden will urge lawmakers to confirm his nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, which has signaled that it will soon take steps to slow the country’s growth in an effort to reduce inflation.  Officials said Mr. Biden will also announce new steps to confront price increases caused by a lack of competition.  The administration will turn its focus to large ocean freight companies that have formed global alliances that control nearly all of the world’s critical east-west trade lines. Those companies have significantly increased their shipping rates through the pandemic, the White House said on Monday.  The Justice Department and the Federal Maritime Commission together will crack down on antitrust violations among shipping companies, to try to bring more competition into the sector. Federal shipping regulators will also step up their oversight of certain practices by shipping companies, like unfair fees.

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.4 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.

And when it does, you’ll lose much of whatever leverage you had left.  Before Putin invaded Ukraine, I might have described the Russian Federation as a medium-size power punching above its weight in part by exploiting Western divisions and corruption, in part by maintaining a powerful military. Since then, however, two things have become clear. First, Putin has delusions of grandeur. Second, Russia is even weaker than most people, myself included, seem to have realized.  It has long been obvious that Putin desperately wants to restore Russia’s status as a Great Power. His already infamous “there is no such thing as Ukraine” speech, in which he condemned Lenin (!) for giving his neighbor what Putin considers a false sense of national identity, made it clear that his aims go beyond recreating the Soviet Union — he apparently wants to recreate the czarist empire. And he apparently thought that he could take a big step toward that goal with a short, victorious war.  So far, it hasn’t worked out as planned. Ukrainian resistance has been fierce; Russia’s military has been less effective than advertised. I’ve been especially struck by reports that the early days of the invasion were hampered by severe logistical problems — that is, the invaders had a hard time providing their forces with the essentials of modern war, above all fuel. It’s true that supply problems are common in war; still, logistics is one thing advanced nations are supposed to be really good at.

I’d gone there to report on how Ukrainians felt about Donald Trump’s attempts to extort their president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and on the American right’s demonization of Ukrainians who’d worked against corruption. Yermolenko spoke, then, of Ukraine as a front line in the global battle between democracy and authoritarianism, with Europe on one side and Vladimir Putin’s Russia on the other — and the role of the United States under Trump confusing and ambiguous.  “It’s about whether democracy, rule of law, are spreading farther to the east,” he said of the conflict over Ukraine’s future. “It’s a long story how it spread to Eastern Europe — first it was Eastern Europe, Central Europe, then there was Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova. We hope it will someday reach Russia.” But it was possible that the ideological tide would go the other way. “There is a new authoritarianism going westward,” said Yermolenko. In this view, the fate of Ukraine’s nascent democracy was a sort of weather vane for the world.  I spoke to Yermolenko again on Sunday, as Russian troops besieged his country. “The spirit is very strong,” he said. “There is no fatalism, no willingness to negotiate on Russia’s terms. There is decisiveness.” Ukrainian self-defense, he said, was chiefly a matter of patriotism, of people defending their home and way of life against a cruel foreign power. But he also saw it as part of the great ideological contest we’d discussed two and a half years ago.  “There is a strong feeling that if Ukraine wins — and I’m sure it wins — that can bring the end of both Putin’s and Lukashenko’s regimes,” he said, referring to Alexander Lukashenko, the strongman president of Belarus, who is reportedly preparing to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia.

The one initiative I really, really want to get accomplished is help for low-income parents. Financial aid and access to high-quality child care. If I can just do that, I’ll be satisfied. Many of my colleagues won’t be, but hey, I’d be happy to be remembered as a president who made things better without high drama. I’ll be the one who’s grinning when everybody yawns.  Ross Douthat  My fellow Americans:  I want to speak to you about a new challenge we face that few politicians talk about. That’s the challenge of falling birthrates, the fact that since the financial crisis in 2007, a smaller and smaller share of Americans is starting families, raising kids.  Our birthrate fell to a recorded low in 2020. That’s bad for our future: It means our society gets older faster; it means we have fewer workers for every retiree; it means fewer young people to take risks, dream big, come up with the invention or figure out the big idea that makes the world a better place. And it’s bad for all the Americans who are having fewer children than they want right now, who have dreams of family that aren’t being fulfilled.  This is a free country. It’s not the government’s job to tell anyone when or whether to have kids. But we can do more, a lot more, to make sure that Americans feel they have the support they need to take the plunge into parenthood. My administration is trying to do that with policies like a bigger child tax credit and universal pre-K. The other party likes to say that they’re the pro-family party, and some of them have reached across the aisle on this — but mostly they’ve just left American parents on their own. So tonight I’m challenging Republicans to step up and actually help the American family they claim to cherish, so that young people, young couples, feel they can afford it when it comes time to raise the next generation, to have the kids they already want.  And I also want to say something on a personal level to those young Americans who look at the world around them, who look at climate change or the pandemic or the threat from Russia and get worried about bringing a kid into this world. I’m not that young myself, as you may have noticed, which means I’ve seen a lot of history. When I was born, World War II was raging, we’d just gone through the Great Depression, and a big part of the globe was in the hands of ruthless totalitarian dictators bent on mass murder. And then when it came time to have kids of my own, the Cold War was on, and we all lived under the threat of nuclear war.  I’m not going to tell you that my life was easy. I’m certainly not going to tell you that raising kids was easy. I’ve seen a lot of struggle, a lot of tragedy, in the world and in my own family. But looking back, even with all the risks, all the danger, all the sorrow, I just want you to know: It’s worth it. It’s worth it. The challenges are big, but they’ve always been big — and the thing is, folks, human beings are bigger, and every new life you bring into the world is another candle lit against the dark.  Bret Stephens  My fellow Americans:  Let us start again.  I campaigned for president promising to bring our nation together. The promise has not been met. I will not point fingers. I will own my share of the failure. And I will work much, much harder to find common ground with all Americans.

Bayesian methods allowed Allied cryptanalysts in World War II to break enemy ciphers using only a few intercepted messages, and similar techniques are essential to marine search-and-rescue operations working from a vessel’s last known position or fragments of debris.  A Bayesian analysis of the vaccine for children under 5 would consider both that Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine has an excellent track record of safety for older children (obviously a 6-month-old is not a 5-year-old, but nor are they an entirely different species) and that we can already make reasonable estimates of how effective a two-dose regimen for little children will be, even against the Omicron variant. And if the newest data shows the vaccine losing effectiveness against this variant at the currently recommended dosages and schedules, statistical techniques that can incorporate this information as quickly as possible should be used to guide any necessary changes to the protocols.  The practice of borrowing information from one experiment to help understand another is not unprecedented. The F.D.A. has acknowledged the value of a Bayesian approach in certain circumstances, including pediatric trials. A 2020 policy document states, “Bayesian inference may be appropriate in settings where it is advantageous to systematically combine multiple sources of evidence, such as extrapolation of adult data to pediatric populations.” And the agency’s guidance for medical device clinical trials — where Bayesian methods have been more accepted for years — includes the endorsement that “Bayesian analysis brings to bear the extra, relevant, prior information, which can help F.D.A. make a decision.” The best way to demonstrate the advantages, when the under-5 vaccine is back up for review, would be for those evaluating the vaccine to put on their Bayesian goggles and consider the whole picture.  Referring to the vaccine trials for children under 5, Dr. Gregory Poland, the founder and director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group in Minnesota, said recently, “I don’t like that there isn’t more data.” Neither do I and other parents. But I also don’t like that my children are unvaccinated going into year three of the pandemic. If the vaccines are safe — and we know they work well in other age groups — that’s meaningful to me both as a parent and as a statistician.  A 2018 editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that when it comes to evaluating trial results, it’s time for clinicians to “embrace their inner Bayesian.” The same goes for the pharmaceutical industry and the agency that regulates it.  Now is the time for a statistical overhaul. If ever there was a trial that cried out for Bayesian methods, this is it. And if ever there were institutions powerful enough to bring about a fundamental change in the ways we interpret data, it would be the F.D.A. and the pharmaceutical companies during the pandemic. In the meantime, people across the country who fret about their unvaccinated young children will continue to do what we’ve become experts at: waiting.

We can watch Russian bombs falling on Ukraine, see Russian tanks smoking on the side of the road, hear from Ukrainian resistance fighters livestreaming their desperate defense.  But there’s another theater to this war that’s harder to see, but may well decide the outcome: the economic war that West is waging on Russia. Europe and the United States initially responded with a limited set of sanctions but then expanded them into a counterattack capable of crushing the Russian economy. Vladimir Putin, for one, understands the danger: As the force of the West’s measures multiplied, he readied his nuclear forces in a bid to warn Europe and the United States off. This is terrifying territory.  [You can listen to this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]  So I asked Adam Tooze — a brilliant economic historian, the director of the European Institute at Columbia, and the author of the indispensable “Chartbook” newsletter — to explain how the war in the financial markets is shaping the war in streets of Ukraine. What he gave me was a whole new way to see how Putin had readied his country for conflict, the leverage that Russia’s energy exports gave it, how the dreams of the globalizers had cracked, and what the West both was and wasn’t doing in response.

The international community must take steps to forestall the accelerating food crisis rippling outward from Ukraine. Countries — including the United States, Canada, France and Australia — should avoid restricting grain exports and work to ensure that trade contributes to global food availability. Nations that rely on Ukraine and Russia for their grain should work with other grain producers to diversify their agricultural supply chains. Sanctions against Russia should be carefully evaluated to ensure that they do not exacerbate food shortages in vulnerable countries.  International efforts to reduce fertilizer prices, by holding down energy prices and maintaining open trade in fertilizers, would help farmers around the world grow crops. Food prices have been high not only because of the pandemic but also because palm and soybean oils have been redirected for biodiesel fuel in the European Union, for instance, and corn for ethanol in the United States. Diverting grain from those uses to food supplies could help to lower prices by replacing losses in supply from Ukraine and Russia. It is also clear that, given the World Food Program’s financial challenges, new strategies are needed for financing humanitarian assistance.  Food security is essential for a nation’s security. Throughout history, we have seen conflict disrupt food supplies and, even more troubling, turn food into a weapon of war. Prioritizing food security for countries that depend on Ukraine and Russia is vital. NATO and its allies must stabilize supplies and assure that humanitarian efforts protect Ukrainians.  Global integration and development since World War II have dramatically reduced famine around the world, but conflict remains a main driver of hunger and supply disruptions that can upend the security of nations. The international community should act now to keep food prices down and ensure that grain supplies reach vulnerable countries. We must take action to prevent hunger and famine from being used in the 21st century as a weapon of war in Ukraine and elsewhere.  Michael J. Puma is the director of the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University’s Climate School, where he has done extensive research on global food security.

That our country can deal with both this immediate challenge from Russia and the long-term challenge of global warming.  Bret: We disagree at last! The more we can do to reduce the West’s dependence on energy from Russia, the better. That should mean reinvesting heavily in new, safe, dependable nuclear energy. The campaign against nuclear turned out to be one of the environmental movement’s dumber moves, since it only made the West more reliant on nasty petrostates like Russia while demonizing a reliable, energy-dense, low-carbon power source. And more fracking for natural gas would help, too, since natural gas is much better for the environment than coal and has the additional advantage that it can be shipped to our European friends in liquefied form.  Gail: This is the future of the planet we’re talking about. We’ve got to find the safest conceivable path forward when it comes to energy. There’s a ton of options for promoting clean power sources if everybody’s willing to admit that it’s going to be an expensive trip forward. Needing much government support, even if that means (cough, cough) more taxes.  Bret: Or less red tape, especially for nuclear power. The other big news of the week, Gail, is Biden’s Supreme Court nominee. Your thoughts on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and the politics of her nomination?  Gail: She’s obviously superqualified. I know a few Republicans were open to at least one of the other possible nominees who had a more centrist record, but we’re talking about replacing Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal, with a liberal justice who once was a Breyer clerk. It’s not going to change the balance of the court, unfortunately.  Bret: Or fortunately. Sorry, go on.  Gail: I’ll be interested to see how the Senate hearings go. I have memories of days of yore when both parties regarded a court appointment as such a solemn duty that they proceeded in a dignified, almost collegial manner. Don’t suppose that will happen now. And I know you’re going to remind me how messy the Democrats were with the Trump nominations. After which I’ll howl about Mitch McConnell never even letting Obama’s Supreme Court nominee come up for a vote.  Or we can just move forward. How do you feel?  Bret: I think she should be confirmed 100 to 0 or at least 96 to 3, which was the vote for Ruth Bader Ginsburg back in 1993. And I say that as someone who will probably disagree with a lot of Jackson’s opinions. My basic view is that presidents should have a right to their Supreme Court pick, regardless of ideology, and that the battles we’ve had in recent years over every nominee haven’t helped anyone, least of all the reputation of the Senate, the image of the court or the sanity of the country.

That means fully fledged refugee status, with the rights to work and receive state services.  There is also a vital need, immediately, for effective administration of reception and registration centers — with dedicated services for pregnant women, targeted efforts for those with medical conditions, and special attention to children. This will require clear lines of responsibility and close coordination between E.U. and U.N. agencies.  Faced with potentially up to five million refugees, Europe must create a plan to share resettlement among European nations and provide financial support to those countries closest to Ukraine that are likely to bear the greatest burden. The lesson of the Syria crisis — when too much was expected of Greece and Italy, where most refugees first landed — is that Poland and Hungary cannot be expected to do it all.  Second, Ukrainians remaining in the country will likely be in greatest need. There are already too many examples around the world, from Yemen to Nigeria, of aid being blocked from reaching civilians. Access to aid is a right under international humanitarian law: It must be protected, and it must be sustained.  That is why it is vital that aid efforts across borders and across conflict lines be established immediately and that humanitarians are able to carry out their work without facing political interference or threat to their lives. This is the moment when rhetoric about the sanctity and dignity of human life will be tested on the ground. Experience shows that only massive pressure can keep aid flows going.  Third, there must be accountability for the conduct of the conflict. There are reports of shells hitting a hospital and schools, plus what appears to be indiscriminate bombing of civilian housing. Such serious breaches of international law — banned under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 — can constitute war crimes.  These incidents must be documented and investigated. Just as German courts have convicted individuals for war crimes in Syria, so must any parties violating international law in Ukraine be held to account. Otherwise, the law of the jungle prevails.

Says Angry Elites Want Him Out of Office  When Chesa Boudin was elected district attorney for San Francisco in 2019, his victory was seen as part of a wave that swept him and other progressive prosecutors into office, including Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Kim Foxx in Chicago and Rachael Rollins in Boston. Boudin, like others in his cohort, promised to work to reform the criminal-justice system by focusing on, among other tactics, decarceration and addressing root causes of crime. Perhaps predictably, Boudin — whose parents are former members of the Weather Underground who served long prison sentences for their roles in a 1981 robbery of a Brink’s armored car that left two police officers and a guard dead — has been met with heavy resistance from those who believe that his office has compromised public safety. While a host of metrics complicate that perception, it remains potent: Boudin, who is 41, is facing a recall election on June 7. “We’re doing things that have never been done before,” he says, “and that does make some people uncomfortable.”  Your critics make the argument that your policies, and by extension progressive prosecutors, create a perception of permissiveness that emboldens criminals. What’s your response? I was clear as a candidate, and our efforts have followed through, that we would focus resources on crimes that cause the most harm: violent crimes, murder, sexual assault. Those are where our charging and conviction rates have gone up. If you are someone who believes in a tough-on-crime deterrence model of the justice system or public safety, then that model must begin with the police making arrests in a high percentage of cases. With theft in San Francisco, people believe they can get away with it because only 2 percent of reported thefts result in arrest. We can hang people in the town square, but the most effective thing at deterring crime is certainty of arrest. But the police make arrests in less than 3 percent of reported auto burglaries. Not blaming the police: These are crimes that are hard to make an arrest in. Because of that, people don’t fear consequences. It has nothing to do with my policies.  There has been a lot of friction between your office and the police. Do you believe they’re trying to undermine you? Some police officers, absolutely. The police union has been out to get me since before Day 1. I also know there’s a lot of San Francisco police officers who hate the politics and want to do their job and do it well, and they’re doing a difficult job under historically challenging circumstances. I have tremendous sympathy and admiration for the members of the San Francisco Police Department who do their job with integrity. It is a dereliction of duty by those other members who, instead of doing their job well, tell the victims that they can’t do anything because they don’t like the district attorney.  Your mayor has also been critical. Do you think she finds it politically expedient to not be more supportive of you with the recall election? There’s a structural flaw in the way that San Francisco’s recalls are designed, which is that the mayor appoints the replacement after a successful recall vote. It creates an incentive for the mayor to always support a recall, because who wouldn’t want to appoint a citywide elected official? Why would she ever oppose a recall?  Maybe I’m a Pollyanna, but “Why would she ever oppose a recall?” — because she thought the person was doing the best job. You haven’t spent much time in San Francisco politics, David. In San Francisco, the county and the city are contiguous. She has the budget of a city and a county combined. The resources are immense, and with those resources come high expectations. When we have problems like the Tenderloin or a housing crisis or an opioid-overdose epidemic, it is convenient for someone with access to those resources and power to have a foil when people are upset. When you have that much power, if people are upset, it’s convenient to have a place to shift the blame.  Chesa Boudin at his swearing-in ceremony in January 2020. Jeff Chiu/Associated Press  I know that you talk a lot about wanting to address root causes of crime. But to what extent can a district attorney even do that? Isn’t your ability to address root causes largely dependent on other actors — like the police, like the mayor — that are part of the system? This is a big question. I want to describe examples of what we’re doing to address root causes. So, we know that gun violence is on the rise across the country, with significant numbers in San Francisco. A traditional prosecutor might say that if someone is in possession of a gun illegally or uses a gun to do something unlawful, we’re going to punish them as harshly as the law allows, and that’s our way of deterring crime. The thing that frustrates me about that approach is that we are accepting that we don’t have a role to play in promoting public safety until after a crime occurs. We’re trying to be proactive in my office. In San Francisco, instead of waiting for the police to make an arrest in homicides involving a ghost gun and punishing the individual that committed the harm, we are suing the ghost-gun companies and asking the courts to prohibit them from shipping their weapons into our community. Another example is expanding partnerships with the state attorney general to get guns out of the hands of people who we know are prohibited from having them. These are proactive approaches to prevent gun violence. A crime prevented: There’s no viral video of that. But if we are serious about good policy, we must be proactive about preventing crime.  What about something like, for example, property theft? Unlike gun violence, it seems to be a bigger problem in San Francisco than it is in some other cities. Is there necessarily going to be a lag between the time it takes to address root causes and a subsequent reduction in that kind of crime? It’s not a new problem. That’s one thing to bear in mind. A second part of that is if you look at the data, overall thefts last year went up a bit but were still well below their 2019 levels. So despite the viral videos and breathless headlines to the contrary, the empirical evidence is that property crime is moving in the right direction. The other thing is, I want to complicate the assumption that it’s not an issue in other cities. I went to New York in November to visit my dad when he got out of prison, and we went to Duane Reade. We wanted to get him basic things: deodorant, a hairbrush, a toothbrush. We went in, and even deodorant, which was like five or six dollars a bar, was behind plexiglass. People on social media would have you think that it’s only in San Francisco where people are so desperate that they’re going to go into Duane Reade or Walgreens and shoplift. The reality is that’s a feature of modern American urban life, in large part because of the horrific wealth inequalities, the poverty, the lack of access to housing, the internet marketplaces where people can resell stolen products. Those trends are national and have nothing to do with me or my policies. That said, this country has spent decades building up a system that efficiently processes individual cases for conviction and incarceration. We can’t, overnight, expect to have a comparable infrastructure for responding to crimes in ways that are more than just warehousing people. Which is why it’s important to recognize that we are focusing wherever possible on root causes. At the same time, we have increased our conviction rate for murders, our charging rate for sexual assaults. My charging rate for drug sales is higher than in years.  I brought up property theft in San Francisco and you made a comparison with Manhattan. But Target is limiting its hours in your city, and Walgreens is closing stores explicitly because of too much theft. There’s also those viral videos of flash-mob robberies — Sorry, David, you’re saying you didn’t see videos of flash-mob burglaries in other cities?  I haven’t, no. Chicago. Walnut Creek. The notion that this is a San Francisco problem is demonstrably false.  Then that’s my mistake. But property theft in San Francisco is a problem. What needs to be happening differently to address it? The major change that has happened when it comes to retail theft in particular is that stores like Walgreens have decided it’s not in their interest to have their security detain shoplifters. The reason is that the police almost never make it to the stores in response to a shoplifting call in time to effectuate an arrest. They rely on store security to hold people long enough for the police to arrive. If Walgreens or Target or any other store decides that it’s too risky, in terms of people getting injured or racial-profiling lawsuits or disturbing other customers — if those costs outweigh the benefit of having their staff make arrests, how do they expect me to prosecute? If the police can’t make arrests, to then say it’s the district attorney’s fault simply doesn’t add up.  Let me ask about another subject that I suspect you might say has been distorted nationally: the Tenderloin, which the mayor declared an emergency zone. But whether anything actually new is happening there is almost beside the point. The point is that an open-air drug market is a bad thing for a city. What can you be doing to improve the situation? The Tenderloin has been an ongoing public-health crisis and state of emergency for at least a decade. This is not a new problem. In fact, one of your colleagues at The New York Times wrote an Op-Ed in which he was highly critical of me. He linked to a video of the Tenderloin and the Civic Center BART station that adjoins it as an example of progressive prosecutors failing. But the video was from 2018. I hadn’t even run for office yet. I’m not saying that to be catty about your colleagues or the fact-checking at The New York Times. I’m making a broader point, which is that the right-wing media — I’m not saying this about The New York Times — has for years loved to point to the Tenderloin as an example of the failures of progressive policies. The reality is that every city in the United States has at least one neighborhood where, historically, through red-lining or policing or zoning, poverty has been consolidated. If you go to New York City, you can’t pretend that the South Bronx doesn’t exist, that deep east Brooklyn doesn’t exist. Those are parts of New York City, just like the Tenderloin is part of San Francisco.  I wouldn’t argue that other parts of the country don’t have historically problematic areas. My question was whether anything should or could be done differently in the Tenderloin. Absolutely. The Tenderloin is an emergency. It is a priority. In San Francisco, we need to have safe consumption sites, because people don’t die of overdoses at safe consumption sites. The second thing we need is people who are drug-addicted to have an easier time accessing treatment and services than they do buying drugs on the street corner. We are prosecuting people the police arrest. It’s not working because there is an insatiable demand for drugs from people who don’t have housing, access to health care, access to employment and access to treatment that can help them reduce their dependence on dangerous drugs.  Boudin at a news conference in December. Gabrielle Lurie/San Francisco Chronicle, via Associated Press  There’s statistical evidence that your approach is working, but that seems to be coming up against a segment of the San Francisco population’s lived experience, insofar as there may be people thinking: The numbers are pointing in the right direction, but then why are there citizen-safety patrols in Chinatown? Why does my car keep getting broken into? The data speaks for itself, but you’re right: The way that people feel matters too. If you walk down a busy street and there are a couple of people who are living in tents or asking for money, you don’t feel unsafe, because there are lots of other people who look like you. After the pandemic, for reasons that have nothing to do with my policies, the financial district is empty. So the number of homeless people hasn’t increased significantly, but that population — people who are mentally ill, addicted, vulnerable to being victims of crime — is more visible in ways that make people who have access to social media, who donate to political campaigns, who have access to reporters at The San Francisco Chronicle or Examiner feel less safe. It’s not wrong or unfair for people to feel that way, but the connection with me is an explicitly political one driven by the recall.  You can point to factors beyond your policies affecting the situation in San Francisco; you can also point to things that you’re doing well. If those things are true, what’s motivating the recall? Where’s the disconnect for San Franciscans? Here’s what’s important to know: To get elected, the most any donor could give me was $500. Recalls are allowed to accept unlimited donations. That’s significant, because the single biggest contributor to the recall is a committee that has given about a $1.5 million so far. We’re not dealing with a grass-roots movement. We’re dealing with a small number of wealthy individuals, many of whom are national Republican major donors, who have financial interests in the real estate industry, in the gig economy and in using the police and the criminal-justice system to force aggressive displacement and gentrification so that their real estate investments can go up. And this is critical: I created a worker-protection unit that filed lawsuits against some gig-economy companies that are systematically misclassifying their employees, calling them independent contractors in blatant violation of California law, in order to avoid paying minimum wage, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and all the other things that they’re required to do to compete fairly. Many of the people donating to the recall are investors in those companies.  Isn’t part of what’s also motivating the recall a philosophical disagreement about the nature of law enforcement? The rhetoric being used by the recall committee is that they support criminal-justice reform too. They know that if they’re honest about their political perspective, they will not win. I’ll give you one example: I had a meeting in 2019 with one of the major donors to the recall. His name was William Oberndorf. At that meeting — I was running for district attorney — he said he would support me if I would oppose San Francisco’s sanctuary-city policy. I said I couldn’t do that. He got very angry, and when someone has the kind of money that he has, he can express his anger in a recall context, and that’s exactly what he’s doing. [When reached for comment, Oberndorf strongly disputed Boudin’s recounting of their meeting and said that he never suggested any sort of quid pro quo regarding sanctuary-city policy and his support of Boudin.]  You said the recall was not a grass-roots movement, but the petition for it got 83,000 signatures — you’re shaking your head. It’s more complicated. It’s a self-reported number of signatures. That number has never been audited or validated. It doesn’t change the fact that, hey, a lot of people seem to have signed. What any political consultant in California politics will tell you is that you can qualify anything you want for the ballot if you spend enough money to hire professional signature gatherers. They incentivize them by paying them per signature they gather. And they send them across the city, and the gatherers say things like: “Do you want to stop sexual assault? Sign here.” If you are allowed to employ those tactics and have unlimited money, then, yes, you will get lots of signatures. That’s a reflection of the money you spend, not necessarily popular support.  I want to ask you about recidivism. There have been cases used as a cudgel against you in which repeat offenders committed tragic crimes when they were back out on the street. Obviously we can always say the counterfactual: If the repeat offender was in jail, that wouldn’t have happened. But locking up every offender for life is not a realistic response to the problem of recidivism. My question, though, is whether progressive prosecutors are asking people to accept some increased collective risk of recidivism in the short term in exchange for a greater collective good in the long term? We have to recognize that the tough-on-crime approach has had lots of opportunities to reduce recidivism rates, and it hasn’t worked. California went through a drastic expansion of incarceration during the 1990s and early 2000s. About two-thirds of the people being released from state prison after local prosecutors had thrown the book at them were rearrested within a couple of years. The other important thing to recognize is that when people talk about recidivism in San Francisco — if you look at the cohort of people we’ve resentenced because we believe they’ve served more than enough time, the recidivism rate is infinitesimally small. But people are going to focus on the Willie Horton case, the one case where something does go wrong, and they’re going to blame my office.  I imagine, given your personal history, that throughout your life you’ve encountered people with strong preconceptions about who you are and what you believe. Is that at all factoring into the opposition you’re facing? If you never spend time with me — and sadly, because of the pandemic, there are far fewer residents and civic leaders in San Francisco who have had an opportunity to do that — it’s easy to be fooled by the dishonesty of the police union and their allies in terms of who I am and what I’m about. The people who work closest with me, the people who know me, the people who have seen the way I approach the problems we face in this office understand that I’m deeply committed to justice and public safety and that I believe that criminal-justice reform can make us safer. That’s why I’m implementing these policies. For no other reason.  This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.

As the Russian assault has intensified, the government in Ukraine has enacted martial law, requiring men to stay in the country and either join the fight or face the prospect of conscription.  We tell the story of three of those men: Eugene, an I.T. worker from the northeastern city of Kharkiv; Tigran, an animator who attempted to cross the border into Poland; and Andrew, who signed up for the territorial defense force two weeks ago.

Mr. Pataki, 76, did not firmly rule out such an idea on Monday, but he did tell reporters he expected one of four contenders to emerge as the nominee: Representative Lee Zeldin of Long Island; Harry Wilson, a businessman; Rob Astorino, the former Westchester County executive; or Andrew Giuliani, the son of the former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  The race appears to be in flux, with the recent Siena poll showing Mr. Zeldin, who has been named the presumptive nominee by party leaders, and Mr. Astorino as largely unknown quantities. Mr. Giuliani, perhaps because of his famous last name, was more polarizing, with a favorable rating of 47 percent among Republicans but a matching unfavorable rating among voters overall.  He significantly trails Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Astorino in fund-raising, according to the last campaign finance disclosure, but he cited his favorability ratings among Republicans as evidence of his ability to connect with voters.  Mr. Giuliani said in an interview that his father, whose zealous efforts to overturn the 2020 election results have made him a pariah among many New Yorkers, would campaign for him in coming weeks.  Mr. Zeldin is favored to receive his party’s endorsement on Tuesday. But Mr. Wilson’s late entry into the race last week and the effort to draft Mr. Pataki to attempt a comeback point to some discontent around Mr. Zeldin, who has a long legislative track record in Albany and Washington that includes voting to overturn the 2020 elections results.  That could be a major liability in a general election against Gov. Kathy Hochul, the likely Democratic nominee and a relative moderate who some Republicans believe will be harder to beat than her predecessor, Andrew M. Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace, would have been.

Russia provides about 10 percent of the world’s oil. Credit... Mikhail Metzel/Associated Press  With oil prices spiking to well above $100 a barrel, the U.S. energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, on Tuesday will lead a meeting of energy officials from around the globe on the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on energy supplies.  Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which is organizing the teleconference, said the group would consider how it “can play a role in stabilizing energy markets.”  Analysts say that the energy agency could be preparing a global release of members’ oil reserves designed to cool down markets alarmed by the shock waves from Russia’s military action.  Oil prices have been turbulent since they hit a seven-year high of $105 a barrel last week after the Russian attack started. On Tuesday, Brent crude was up more than 6 percent, to $104 a barrel.  The meeting is being called amid concerns that sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western nations could result in reduced flows of energy from Russia, which supplies one in 10 barrels of oil globally as well as around one-third of the European Union’s natural gas.  Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, said in a note to clients that she expected that “the U.S. will soon tap its strategic petroleum reserve as part of a broader” release coordinated by the international agency. Barring a breakthrough in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, there was a risk of a large portion of Russian oil exports being crimped as a result of the sanctions, even though Western governments have said that they do not intend to disrupt energy flows, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note. If so, oil prices could go as high as $120 a barrel, the analysts forecast. So far, loadings of tankers of oil and liquefied natural gas from Russia are proceeding as normal, said Alex Booth, head of research at Kpler, which tracks shipping. But, he added, a liquefied natural gas tanker coming from a facility partly owned by TotalEnergies in Russia and named for Christophe de Margerie, the French giant’s former chief executive who was killed in a plane crash in Moscow in 2014, had recently changed its destination from Britain to France after London barred Russian-linked ships from British ports. Potential relief could come from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, which are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the oil markets. So far, there is little indication that the group is willing to do more than agree to go ahead with its usual 400,000 barrels a day of additional supply in April. Saudi Arabia, the co-leader of the group, called OPEC Plus, has been talking with Biden administration officials about the oil markets, but a deal does not yet seem to have been reached. Discussions are likely to be complicated because Russia is the co-leader of OPEC Plus. And it is uncertain if there will be enough support at the meeting for an increase in production beyond 400,000 barrels a day. The United Arab Emirates, which along with the Saudis would be expected to be a source of additional oil supplies, recently abstained from the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That decision “underscores the likely unwillingness” of some countries to bolster production at this time, Ms. Croft said.

Democrats fell 14 votes short of the 60 needed to bring the Women’s Health Protection Act to the floor for consideration after the House last September passed it on a narrow party-line vote. One Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, joined all Republicans in opposition to beginning debate on the measure.  Lawmakers said it was the first time that the Senate had voted on a separate bill to enact the constitutional protections of Roe v. Wade into law. The outcome was anticipated, but Democrats were determined to hold the vote as members of both parties draw battle lines over what is expected to be a major election-year issue. The conservative-dominated Supreme Court is set to rule later this year on a case that could undermine or overturn the landmark abortion decision.  “We want Americans to know where their legislators stand on this important issue,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3 Democrat and a leading backer of the abortion rights bill.

Part of the strategy is increasing the capacity for importing liquefied natural gas. The commission has been reaching out to several gas producers — including the United States, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Egypt — and to Japan and South Korea, to see whether they could redirect some of their imported supplies to Europe. E.U. imports of liquefied natural gas set a record in January.  The commission will also propose a mechanism for voluntary reduction of consumption, Ms. Simson said, but she did not elaborate.  Separately, the bloc stepped up its work on synchronization of Moldova’s and Ukraine’s electricity grids with the European one “as soon as possible” because of the Russian invasion.  “The political will is there — we have to help Ukraine,” said France’s minister for ecological transition, Barbara Pompili. “They are at a risk of a blackout, which would have very heavy consequences.”

In that study, people who walked for about 8,000 steps a day were half as likely to die prematurely from heart disease or any other cause as those who accumulated 4,000 steps a day. The statistical benefits of additional steps were slight, meaning it did not hurt people to amass more daily steps, up to and beyond the 10,000-steps mark. But the extra steps did not provide much additional protection against dying young, either.  Realistically, few of us reach that 10,000-step goal, anyway. According to recent estimates, most adults in America, Canada and other Western nations average fewer than 5,000 steps a day.  And if we do reach the 10,000-step target, our feat tends to be ephemeral. A famous study in Ghent, Belgium, provided local citizens in 2005 with pedometers and encouraged them to walk for at least 10,000 steps a day for a year. Of the 660 men and women who completed the study, about 8 percent reached the 10,000 step daily goal by the end. But in a follow-up study four years later, almost no one was still striding that much. Most had slipped back to their baseline, taking about the same number of steps now as at the study’s start.  The good news is that upping our current step counts by even a few thousand additional strides most days could be a reasonable, sufficient — and achievable — goal, Dr. Lee said. The formal physical activity guidelines issued by the United States and other governments use time, not steps, as a recommendation, and suggest we exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or a half-hour most days, in addition to any moving around we do as part of our normal, daily lives. Translated into step counts, Dr. Lee said, that total would work out to a little more than 16,000 steps a week of exercise for most people, or about 2,000 to 3,000 steps most days. (Two thousand steps equal approximately a mile.) If, like many people, we currently take about 5,000 steps a day during the course of everyday activities like shopping and housework, adding the extra 2,000 to 3,000 steps would take us to a total of between 7,000 and 8,000 steps most days, which, Dr. Lee said, seems to be the step-count sweet spot.

But with commercial air traffic halted as Russian troops invaded Ukraine, their stay in Miami — and the run of their pop-up exhibition there — was extended.  The show, titled “The Memory on Her Face,” features socially charged work by five Ukrainian artists. After arriving in Miami in November to run booths at two of the satellite art fairs held concurrently with Art Basel Miami Beach — NADA and Untitled Art — the Voloshyns contracted Covid, postponing their return for a month. By mid-January, with several prominent Ukrainian art collectors coming to Miami in February, they mounted this impromptu show inside a small warehouse in the Allapattah neighborhood, with Untitled’s Omar Lopez-Chahoud as the curator.  “It’s a documentation of what has been happening in Ukraine for the last few years,” explained Julia Voloshyn by phone from the Miami rental, where she, her husband and their small child are staying.

Sort of the same way Disney wants to tie all of its franchises together. Yeah, now Mickey is fighting Thanos? That’s weird, but profitable.” — TREVOR NOAH  “Well, damn, Putin’s goal was to bring back the glory days of the Soviet Union. People waiting hours in long lines is definitely a start.” — TREVOR NOAH  “They’re cutting off banking, they’re arming their enemies, and on top of that, airlines are stopping flights to and from Russia, which in my opinion might be one of the worst things. Because I mean the best part about going to Russia is that you can fly out of Russia. Now they don’t even have that.” — TREVOR NOAH  “Yes, the threat of nuclear annihilation may have increased; yes, we may be on the brink of World War III; and, yes, Europe is once again at the mercy of one power-hungry dictator, but on the bright side, when was the last time you thought about Covid, huh?” — TREVOR NOAH

Jenny de Jong Gierveld, a sociologist at Vrije University in Amsterdam, said that as early as 1995, social scientists in the Netherlands added questions to large national surveys to track later-life LAT relationships. Dr. Brown said that didn’t happen in the United States, where surveys typically ask who is in a household. Nevertheless, Dr. Connidis said, social scientists can infer that LAT is now a “popular option” in the United States and Canada. For example, the sociologist Huijing Wu of the University of Western Ontario determined that of unmarried but partnered Wisconsin residents over 50 in 2011, 38 percent were daters, 32 percent were LATs, and 30 percent were cohabiting.  Social scientists comment on the resourcefulness of these older couples, who are creating ways to enjoy the intimacy and emotional support of marriage or cohabitation — as several studies on LAT have confirmed they do — while avoiding caregiving expectations. As Dr. Gierveld and her colleagues have found, LAT partners provide mainly emotional support to each other but not hands-on care. Some couples assume some care but not full-time.  “Once they’re in that relationship,” Dr. Connidis said, “partners end up more willing to care for each other than they thought they’d be, but not necessarily to the same level as a marital partner.”  Jill Spoon, 73, and John Backe, 74, a LAT couple in New York City for nearly a decade, illustrate the complexity of this emotional bond. When Ms. Spoon, a retired administrator, and Mr. Backe, a retired pastor, met and fell in love, both were 64 and gave no thought to caregiving. Yet they opted to live in their own apartments, getting together about four times a week. Ms. Spoon, in particular, then working full-time with an active social life, wanted to maintain her independence while enjoying their intimacy.  Three years later, the issue of caregiving arose when Mr. Backe had major heart surgery and needed several months of at-home convalescent care; he moved into her apartment for those months. Ms. Spoon said she coordinated care with his two “amazing daughters,” backed up by a visiting nurse and friends, while she continued working. This teamwork is now their model for any future caregiving needs. Neither wants the other to become their primary caregiver. “I’d want John to retain as vital a lifestyle as possible,” she said, and he said he wants the same for her. She has no children but would rely on her long-term care insurance to hire help. For her partner’s care, she said, “I’d want to be involved enough because I care and love him, but not 24/7. I don’t have the energy for that,” and it would mean “I couldn’t do anything else.”  Expectations for care are lower for couples who do not marry or cohabit, social scientists said. Yet some question whether even expectations for married people are reasonable.  Allison Forti, a counseling professor at Wake Forest University, noted that some women may feel cultural and social expectations to serve as caregivers. “I think it’s important for women to know it is OK to not want to serve as a caregiver and to still hold value as women in society,” she said. Full-time caregiving “takes a significant physical and emotional toll on someone,” she noted. In a 2020 report from the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP, 23 percent of Americans said caregiving had made their health worse.

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

Rocket strikes on the centre of Kharkiv killed at least 10 people and wounded 35, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. Similar strikes killed and wounded dozens in the city the previous day.  "The rubble is being cleared and there will be even more victims and wounded," he said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the artillery barrages on Kharkiv amounted to state terrorism.  Nearly a week since Russian troops poured over the border, they have failed to capture a single major Ukrainian city after running into fierce resistance. The civilian deaths of the last 48 hours were an ominous sign that frustrated Russian commanders could be resorting to more devastating tactics.  Russia still has more forces to throw into the fight even though President Vladimir Putin faces worldwide condemnation and international sanctions for his actions, which have shattered the post-Cold War peace in Europe.  Oil company Shell became the latest Western firm to announce it was pulling out of Russia. The sanctions and global financial isolation have already had a devastating impact on Russia's economy, with the rouble in freefall and queues outside banks as Russians rush to salvage their savings.  Zelenskiy's government remained in control of Kyiv on Tuesday, with soldiers and civilians ready to fight the invaders street by street.  But pictures released by U.S. satellite company Maxar showed Russian tanks, artillery and fuel trucks stretching for 40 miles (60 km) along a highway to the north.  "For the enemy, Kyiv is the key target," Zelenskiy, who has remained in the capital rallying Ukrainians, said in a message overnight. "We will neutralise them all."  Russian troops fired artillery at Kyiv, Kharkiv and the southern port city of Mariupol overnight while the Ukrainian side shot down Russian military planes around the capital, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a briefing.  Ukrainian authorities also reported 70 soldiers killed in a rocket attack in a town between Kyiv and Kharkiv.  Zelenskiy, addressing the European Parliament by video link a day after he signed an official request to join the European Union, urged the bloc to prove that it sided with Ukraine.  "Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine," he said in an emotional speech.  RISK TO CIVILIANS  In Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Kremlin would press its military operation in Ukraine until it achieves its goals. It aimed to protect itself from threats created by the West, and Russia was not occupying Ukraine's territory, the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.  Britain's defence ministry said in an intelligence update that the Russian advance on Kyiv had made little progress in the past 24 hours, probably due to logistical problems. But it also warned of a shift in Russian tactics that could worsen the plight of civilians.  "The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties," it said.  1/5 An ambulance is seen through the damaged window of a vehicle hit by bullets, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine February 28, 2022.

Ukraine's general staff said Russian losses included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft and 198 tanks, all figures that could not be verified.  Russia has not given a full account of its battlefield losses, but pictures from Ukraine have shown burnt-out Russian tanks and bodies on the road where they have been attacked by Ukrainian defenders.  Talks held on Monday at the Belarus border failed to reach a breakthrough. Negotiators have not said when a new round will take place.  'I SAW WAR'  More than 660,000 people, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Romania, the U.N. refugee agency said.  At the Hungarian border crossing Tiszabecs, a mother cradled a baby in her arms after a four-day drive from Kyiv.  "I saw war, I saw rockets," said her older son Ivan, 15, who looked exhausted and pale after the journey. His father had stayed behind to fight.  At the United Nations, the General Assembly met ahead of a vote to isolate Russia, deploring Moscow's "aggression against Ukraine" and demanding its troops stop fighting and withdraw.  Putin's Russia faces near total international isolation, with the notable exception of China, over his decision to launch what he called a "special military operation" to disarm Ukraine and capture "neo-Nazis and drug addicts" that lead it.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The White House on Monday reacted coolly to a proposal by Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy for a no-fly zone for Russian flights over Ukraine, saying U.S. participation in such a move would be tantamount to a direct conflict with Moscow, which Washington does not want.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both said that Russian forces appeared to have used widely banned cluster munitions, with Amnesty accusing them of attacking a preschool in northeastern Ukraine while civilians took shelter inside.  Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with members of the U.S. Congress that Russia had used a thermobaric weapon, known as a vacuum bomb, in its invasion of her country.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "They used the vacuum bomb today," Markarova said after a meeting with lawmakers. "...The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."  A vacuum bomb, or thermobaric weapon, sucks in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, typically producing a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive and is capable of vaporizing human bodies.  There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. CNN reported that one of its teams had spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rocket launcher near the Ukrainian border early on Saturday afternoon.

"If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime," she told a press briefing, noting that there are international organizations that would assess that and President Joe Biden's administration "would look to be a part of that conversation."  The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.  Markarova said Ukraine was working actively with the Biden administration and Congress to obtain more weapons and tougher sanctions.  "They should pay, they should pay a heavy price," she told reporters after leaving the meeting.  One lawmaker who attended the meeting, Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, said the Ukrainians had asked for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine but that he felt that was too dangerous because it could provoke conflict with Russia. read more  Amnesty International said international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions.

Medical needs are already acute, with the World Health Organization warning on Sunday that oxygen supplies were running out. read more  Fears of a wider public health crisis are growing as people flee their homes, health services are interrupted and supplies fail to reach Ukraine, which has also been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said on Monday routine immunisation and outbreak control efforts for polio had been suspended in Ukraine because of the fighting. WHO has received reports that coronavirus vaccination campaigns have also been put on hold in many parts of the country, he said.  Last October, Ukraine found the first polio case in Europe for five years - a 17-month old toddler who was paralysed - and another case involving paralysis was found in January.  Nineteen more children have been identified with the vaccine-derived form of polio but without symptoms of paralysis.  A nationwide polio immunisation campaign to reach the 100,000 children still unprotected in Ukraine began on Feb. 1, but has been halted since fighting began and as health authorities shift to emergency care. read more  The WHO said electricity shortages in some areas had affected the safety of vaccine stock, and surveillance had been disrupted.  "WHO is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio caused by the conflict," said Jasarevic.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.  CONCERN FOR HIV PATIENTS  The U.N. agency for HIV/AIDS has said there is less than a month's worth of drugs for HIV patients left in Ukraine.  "People living with HIV in Ukraine only have a few weeks of antiretroviral therapy remaining with them, and without continuous access their lives are at risk," said UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima.  Before Russia's invasion began last week, Ukraine had 250,000 people living with HIV, the second-largest number in Europe after Russia.  It also had high rates of tuberculosis, including one of the highest rates of multi-drug resistant TB in the world. There are an estimated 30,000 new TB cases annually in Ukraine.  Ukraine's government and the Stop TB Partnership, an international initiative, said on Monday all TB clinics in the country were still open, but patients had been given a month-long supply of drugs to take away with them in case the situation worsened or it was dangerous to travel to clinic.  Enough treatments are available for existing and projected new patients until the end of 2022, Stop TB said, although the organisation is working with the WHO on potential emergency orders for neighbouring countries.  Interruptions in treatment or diagnosis can drive up wider transmission as well as risk patients' lives, experts say.  "It's clear we expect many more TB cases," said Viorel Soltan, a Stop TB Partnership representative, predicting an impact on the wider health system in Ukraine.  COVID-19 is also still a concern, with only just over one in three people fully vaccinated against the virus disease. Daily new cases hit a peak of around 40,000 in February but were declining before reporting stopped after Russia's invasion.  Humanitarian relief organisation Project HOPE said on Monday pharmacies in all cities under attack were reporting running out of medical supplies.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Summary  Summary Companies Traders remain squarely focused on Ukraine crisis  Rouble steadies but FX market now split in two  European shares drop as sentiment remains poor  Oil jumps back above $100 a barrel  Bond markets trim rate hike expectations  LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - European stocks sagged and oil jumped back above $100 a barrel on Tuesday as markets struggled with massive uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although the rouble steadied as Moscow scrambled support for its beleaguered markets.  Russia's stock markets remained suspended and some bond trading platforms were no longer showing prices, but dealing in the major financial centres both in Europe and in Asia overnight was orderly, albeit jittery.  Losses for the pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) were starting to mount again, with the index down nearly 2% by midsession and Wall Street expected to open around 1% lower in New York later.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  There had initially been gains for mining (.SXPP) and oil & gas (.SXEP) stocks but even those had soured and there was a heavy 4% slump in bank stocks with investors now sensing that interest rate hikes might now get delayed.  Paul Jackson, Global Head of Asset Allocation Research, Invesco said: "assuming no rapid resolution to this conflict, we fear that global GDP could be reduced by 0.5%-1.0%."  "That's enough to aggravate the ongoing slowdown but not enough to produce recession," although he cautioned that some parts of Europe could see a recession and that inflation was also likely to stay higher for longer.  High-level talks between Kyiv and Moscow on Monday had ended with no agreement except to keep talking, and nerves were acute as a huge Russian armoured column bore down on Kyiv on Tuesday after lethal shelling of civilian areas in Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv. read more  With Russia one of the world's largest oil and producers, Brent crude futures were up $4.51, or 4.6%, to $102.75 a barrel. That was just below a seven-year high of $105.79 hit after Moscow launched its assault on Ukraine last week.  European natural gas prices leapt nearly 15% too. Both oil and gas prices are now up nearly 60% since fears of an invasion of Ukraine began to escalate in November.  "The fragile situation in Ukraine and financial and energy sanctions against Russia will keep the energy crisis stoked and oil well above $100 per barrel in the near-term and even higher if the conflict escalates further," Louise Dickson, senior oil market analyst from Rystad Energy, wrote in a note.  ROUBLE  The sense that the war and higher energy prices could slow the global economy meant euro zone bond yields continued to fall in the bond markets as traders further reduced their bets on rate hikes from the European Central Bank this year.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were sitting at 1.80% in European trading having been over 2% less than two weeks ago , while the euro resumed its decline in the currency market.  Momentum in euro zone manufacturing growth had already waned slightly last month, revised PMI data showed on Tuesday, although it was still strong and firms said supply chain constraints had eased.  "Don't let the drop in the headline PMI distract from what should be viewed as a largely positive month for the euro area manufacturing sector in February," said Joe Hayes, senior economist at data compiler IHS Markit said.  Russia's rouble appeared to be stabilising after plunging as much as 30% to a record 120 per dollar after Western countries had slapped Russia with the most far-reaching sanctions ever placed on such an interconnected global economy.  Those measures include cutting Russia's top banks from the SWIFT international financial network and sanctioning its central bank in a bid to limit Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion of foreign reserves.  Russia responded on Tuesday by temporarily stopping foreign investors from selling Russian assets to ensure they take a "considered decision" Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said. Russia's huge sovereign wealth fund will also be pressed into action, spending up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.3 billion) to buy shares in Russian companies, a source close to the government told Reuters.  Sanctions though mean that the big global banks are now reluctant to trade with Russian banks and vice versa, which means there are now effectively two different rouble currency markets - one in Russia and one internationally.  Traders in London were quoting the rouble at between 101 and 105 per dollar , although it had been around 94 per dollar according to some local market prices .  More broadly, currency market volatility is at its highest since late 2020, as measured by a Deutsche Bank index (.DBCVIX) and the rouble is down almost 30% from its best levels this year.  "Today, the focus will be on whether sanctions/retaliation will start impacting the commodity flows from Russia, and whether (Russia's central bank) will step in with more measures to support the rouble," ING FX analysts wrote in a note to clients.  Trading in Russian stocks meanwhile remain suspended on the Moscow Exchange and Russian sovereign and corporate bond prices were not showing on some trading platforms. JPMorgan's widely-tracked GBI-EM Global Diversified index did still include Russia's rouble-denominated bonds although Monday's market plunge had slashed their so-called weighting in the index.  Foreign investors held $20 billion of Russia’s dollar- and rouble-denominated government debt at the end of last year according to Russian central bank data while they own just over $85 billion worth of equities according to the Moscow Exchange.  "A lot of the (global) price action is a function of uncertainty." said Madison Faller at JPmorgan Private Bank.

REUTERS/Yves Herman  Summary Treat us as equals, Ukraine tells EU  EU says to consider Ukraine candidacy, but will be 'difficult'  EU lawmakers set to call Russia "rogue state" - draft  EU lawmakers call for tougher sanctions  BRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the EU on Tuesday via video link to an emergency session of the European Parliament to "prove that you are with us" in Ukraine's war with Russia, a day after Kyiv officially asked to join the bloc.  European Union lawmakers, many wearing #standwithUkraine T-shirts bearing the Ukrainian flag, others with blue-and-yellow scarves or ribbons, gave Zelenskiy a standing ovation.  "We are fighting to be equal members of Europe," Zelenskiy said in Ukrainian in a speech translated into English by an interpreter who spoke through tears.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans, and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness," he said. "The EU will be much stronger with us."  Zelenskiy has remained in Kyiv to rally his people against the invasion. As he spoke on Tuesday, a Russian armoured column was bearing down on Ukraine's capital. read more  The presidents of eight central and eastern European nations on Monday published an open letter calling for Ukraine to be granted immediate EU candidate status and for the start of formal membership talks. read more  HARD TO JOIN EU  But Ukraine is well aware that any membership process will be long and difficult, even if it manages after the war to avoid falling back under Moscow's domination. read more  Charles Michel, the chairman of EU leaders, told the EU Parliament after Zelenskiy's speech that the bloc would have to seriously look at Ukraine's "legitimate" request to join.  But he added: "It is going to be difficult, we know there are different views in Europe (about further enlargement)."  According to a draft text they will vote on later on Tuesday, EU lawmakers are expected to brand Russia a "rogue state" and urge member states to agree even tougher sanctions.  The EU has taken unprecedented steps, including financing weapons deliveries to Ukraine, after President Vladimir Putin launched war on Russia's neighbour last week. read more  According to the draft resolution and amendments backed by the assembly's main parties, lawmakers will call for the scope of sanctions to be broadened and "aimed at strategically weakening the Russian economy and industrial base, in particular the military-industrial complex".  Russia's invasion of Ukraine "effectively makes Russia a rogue state," the lawmakers are set to say.  While Putin "recalls the most dreadful statements of 20th century dictators", Zelenskiy is being "heroic", the draft of the non-binding resolution said.  The European Parliament will also urge EU leaders to be tougher on oligarchs and officials close to the Russian leadership, restrict oil and gas imports from Russia, ban Russia and its ally Belarus entirely from the SWIFT bank messaging system, and to close all EU ports to Russian ships or ships headed to or from Russia.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special military operation" aimed at ridding the country of leaders it characterises as "neo-Nazis and drug addicts".  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Putin's decision to invade Ukraine had had the effect of uniting countries against Russia.  "If Putin was seeking to divide the European Union, to weaken NATO, and to break the international community, he has achieved exactly the opposite," von der Leyen told the EU Parliament, a blue and yellow ribbon pinned to her jacket.

A Russian armoured column bore down on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Tuesday after the deadly shelling of civilian areas in its second largest city indicated that frustrated Russian commanders could resort to more devastating tactics to achieve the goals of their invasion.  Talks on Monday between Russian and Ukrainian officials ended with no breakthrough.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began Thursday morning with attacks by land, sea and air in what was immediately the largest military assault by one European state on another since World War Two. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”  The U.N. Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner said that, as of Sunday, at least 102 Ukrainian civilians had been killed, including 7 children, though it said the office “believes that real figures are considerably higher.”  Ukraine’s health ministry said on Sunday 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of the invasion. Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. said Russia’s forces were not firing on civilian targets in Ukraine.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch  March 1 (Reuters) - Bitcoin has leapt since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, bolstered by people in those countries looking to store and move money in anonymous and decentralised crypto.  Bitcoin trading denominated in the Russian rouble went into overdrive when the invasion began on Thursday, with daily volumes rising 259% from a day earlier to 1.3 billion rouble ($13.1 million), according to data from CryptoCompare.  In Ukraine, meanwhile, crypto exchange Kuna saw its daily trading volume more than treble to 150 million hryvnias ($5 million).  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Bea O'Carroll, managing director at Radkl, a digital asset investment firm, said the war and Western sanctions had seen a trend emerge of bitcoin being used to transfer value.  "Basically, having a currency that is not controlled by the government, that is not affected by the emergency acts ... is really interesting," she added. "Maybe this is how Russia gets its value moved around. Equally, on the other side, there was 'this is how people are going to get value to the Ukrainians'."  In the five days since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, bitcoin has risen 13%, while the S&P 500 U.S. stock index that it often mimics is up around 2% and traditional safety play gold is now largely flat after gaining as much as 3.5% on the day of the invasion.  On the day of the attack, about $300 million short bitcoin positions were liquidated, Coinglass data showed, while Singapore-based QCP Capital said "a good portion" of leveraged long positions had been taken out.  As well as being largely anonymous, crypto holdings and transactions are often held in wallets on decentralised platforms that can be accessed from anywhere.  ENTER THE OLIGARCHS  "Bitcoin could be a potential safe haven for Russian oligarchs avoiding sanctions as there will be no censor on the Bitcoin network and on cryptocurrency transactions," said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.  "Cryptocurrencies could act as a powerful store of value for a major part of holdings that don't need to be liquid."  Yet for crypto fans, the fact that such holdings could offer a route around sanctions could be a double-edged sword.  "It could lead to regulations from NATO countries against usage of crypto, but the flip side is that there could be broader adoption in places with geopolitical turmoil," said Katie Talati, head of research at digital asset manager Arca.  Ukraine was also quick to spot an opportunity in the crypto world's reach and anonymity. Vice-Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted the wallet addresses of bitcoin and ether , alongside an appeal: "Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations."  Fedorov's government and Ukrainian non-governmental organisations raised over $22 million in cryptocurrencies after the appeals, according to blockchain analysis company Elliptic. read more  While bitcoin may be emerging as a currency of choice in areas of geopolitical risk, however, market players caution there are differing views over whether it can more broadly become a "safe-haven" asset, a form of digital gold.  For Zach Friedman, co-founder of crypto brokerage Secure Digital Markets, bitcoin's post-invasion gains serve to enforce the "narrative around bitcoin's store of value during turbulent times".  STABLECOINS ON FIRE  Elsewhere: money is flowing into "stablecoins", which are pegged to traditional assets such as the U.S. dollar.  As of Friday, stablecoin transactions comprised over 83% of the total crypto market's 24-hour trading volume according to CoinMarketCap.  USD Tether, the largest stablecoin saw its market capitalization climb to an all time high of nearly $80 billion, while gold-backed cryptocurrency PAX Gold added nearly $100 million to its market cap in two days.

We are improving this feature as we continue to test and develop in beta. We welcome feedback, which you can provide using the feedback tab on the right of the page.  Major international law firms with Russia offices, including White & Case, Baker McKenzie and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, are scrambling to respond this week as an intensifying sanctions web puts some clients off limits and threatens their business in Moscow.  White & Case, a New York-founded firm with more than 2,200 attorneys that worked with sanctioned VTB Bank last year on a $1.7 billion restructuring deal, is assessing its work in Russia and Belarus "and taking steps to exit some representations in accordance with applicable rules of professional responsibility," a firm spokesperson said Monday.  A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie, which has advised VTB on financing matters and has roughly 4,700 lawyers, said Monday that the firm is “reviewing and adjusting our Russia-related operations and client work” to comply with sanctions. "This will mean in some cases exiting relationships completely," the spokesperson said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Baker McKenzie's website says it has more than 130 lawyers based in Russia.  A spokesperson for Philadelphia-founded Morgan Lewis said the firm will ensure it remains in compliance with sanctions, “including with respect to any client representations.”  Morgan Lewis earlier this month touted its work for VTB Bank and the Russian state development corporation VEB.RF in a $2.3 billion financing project for a mining site. The 2,000-lawyer firm removed a press release on the deal from its website Monday.  At least two other U.S. law firms, Sidley Austin and Venable, already last week terminated registrations to lobby in Washington for sanctioned financial institutions VTB and Sberbank, respectively.  The West has moved to punish Russia with a raft of measures, including shutting out some Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network and restricting Moscow's ability to use its $630 billion foreign reserves.  The economic fallout has continued to escalate. Shell said Monday that it will exit all Russian operations, one day after BP said it will pull out its stake in the Russian oil giant Rosneft over the Ukrainian invasion.  At least 20 international law firms have offices in Moscow, hosting lawyers who often work with colleagues in London and New York to advise clients in energy, finance and other sectors.  It's unclear how much business law firms will lose from severing ties with prohibited clients, and many will likely find business advising other clients on navigating the sanctions. Not all of the new sanctions have immediately gone into effect, giving firms time to end relationships.  Many global law firms that have Moscow offices have worked with newly sanctioned Russian entities in the past, according to press releases and media accounts, including Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld; Allen & Overy; Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; Debevoise & Plimpton; Dentons; Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; Hogan Lovells; Latham & Watkins; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Representatives for those firms declined to comment or did not respond to questions about their Russia work and operations.  Representatives for London-founded global firm Linklaters, transatlantic firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner and Texas-founded Baker Botts, which also have offices in Moscow and have worked for newly sanctioned entities, said they were reviewing their client matters.  A lawyer in the Moscow office of one global law firm said the scope of current sanctions would cut more deeply into international lawyers' business in Russia than past sanctions rounds, as the new penalties from individual countries overlap more broadly.  “London firms won’t be able to just step in where U.S. firms had to back out,” said the lawyer, who requested anonymity to speak about a sensitive topic. “It’ll be more complicated this time.”  Read more:  Ukraine and Russia: What you need to know right now  'The world will change now': Law firms in Ukraine cope with Russian invasion  U.S. weighs entering court fight between Ukraine and Russia's Tatneft  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The United States sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG last week after Russia recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine prior to its invasion of the country, which has prompted a wave of economic sanctions by the West. read more  Nord Stream 2 AG, which is registered in Switzerland and owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom , last year completed the $11 billion project which was designed to double the capacity to pump gas from Russia to Germany.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks about a potential insolvency are confidential, said that Nord Stream 2 AG has been working with a financial adviser on clearing some of its liabilities and could formally begin insolvency proceedings in a Swiss court as soon as this week.  Nord Stream 2 AG did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Gazprom declined to comment.  The 1,230 km (767 mile) pipeline had not begun commercial operations because it was pending certification in Germany, which last week put this process on hold as a result of the escalating Ukraine crisis.  The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued an executive order on Feb. 23 authorising "the wind down of transactions involving Nord Stream 2 AG" or "any entity in which Nord Stream 2 AG owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest" by March 2.  Gazprom paid half the cost of building Nord Stream 2, with the remainder of the $11 billion pipeline project financed by British oil and gas major Shell (SHEL.L), Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI), France's Engie and Germany's Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall DEA (WINT.UL).  Shell, Engie, and Wintershall DEA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OMV declined to comment.  A spokesperson for Uniper said the company does not currently have any such information when asked about a possible insolvency filing by Nord Stream 2 AG.  Swiss-registered Nord Stream 2 AG is also terminating the contracts of workers, the sources said. It was unclear if all entities related to Nord Stream 2 AG would be shut down or how Gazprom plans to proceed with the pipeline maintenance.  Switzerland's Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said in an interview with Swiss radio service RTS on Monday that all Nord Stream staff, more than 140 employees, who worked for the company in the Swiss city of Zug had been fired.  Germany, which gets half its gas from Russia, had backed Nord Stream 2 to diversify energy supplies for Europe, but the project faced opposition within the European Union and from the United States for increasing the region's gas dependence on Russia and allowing Moscow to reduce volumes through Ukraine, for which it has to pay a transit fee.  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, several large companies, including oil majors, said they would exit their Russian operations, including Shell, which said it will no longer be involved in Nord Stream 2 among other investments.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst  WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen must block Russia from exchanging the $17 billion in International Monetary Fund reserves it received last year and oppose any further such IMF allocations, U.S. Republican lawmakers said.  The 41 lawmakers said in a letter to Yellen that the $650 billion allocation of Special Drawing Rights to IMF members had undermined previous sanctions on Russia even before it invaded Ukraine.  "The hostile invasion of Ukraine this week demonstrates why the IMF should never have approved its latest $650 billion general allocation of SDRs in August 2021," the lawmakers said in the letter dated Feb. 28.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  All IMF members received SDRs - backed by dollars, euros, yen, sterling and yuan - in proportion to their shareholding in the Fund in the distribution aimed at helping poorer countries fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But to spend the $17 billion in SDRs it received, Russia would need to find a partner country willing to exchange them for underlying currencies in the form of an interest-bearing loan.  The United States and Western allies have imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank aimed at neutralizing Moscow's $640 billion reserves, which would make such a transaction difficult and subject the counterparty to sanctions as well. read more  But the lawmakers used the invasion to repeat their longstanding criticism of the SDR allocation, which also provided SDRs to China and Iran. They said Yellen should press IMF members to formally agree not to exchange Russia's SDRs, and should oppose further allocations because they would grant more assets to Moscow.  "We cannot allow these reserve assets to help the regime withstand the latest sanctions announced by the President, let alone offer additional billions through further allocations," wrote the lawmakers, led by Representative French Hill of Arkansas and Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee.  The lawmakers also said that Yellen and U.S. allies must plan for contingencies to block a bailout if an economically weakened Russia is forced to turn to the IMF for future loans.  "As the largest shareholder of the IMF, the United States has a responsibility to ensure that the Fund is not misused to support Russia's warmongering in Ukraine," the lawmakers wrote.  A U.S. Treasury spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  But Mark Sobel, a former Treasury and IMF official, said that $17 billion in SDRs was a pittance compared to Russia's $630 billion in foreign currency reserves, most of which are now locked up by Western sanctions against Russia's central bank.  "I think Russia's SDRs are fairly irrelevant and meaningless in the bigger scheme of things," said Sobel, now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum think tank.  "China and Russia have little use for their SDRs," while Iran "doesn't appear to have touched its 2021 SDR allocation" he added.

REUTERS/Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy  VIENNA/FRANKFURT, March 1 (Reuters) - Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is looking into leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that would make it the first European bank to do so since the country's invasion of Ukraine.  Such a decision, which could see one of central and eastern Europe's biggest banks quit both Russia and Ukraine, is not imminent, but could be triggered if its businesses in those countries need further cash or capital, one of the people said.  RBI has operated in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union thirty years ago and its business there - Russia's No. 10 bank by assets - contributed almost a third to the group's net profit of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last year.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Its contingency plan shows how some foreign businesses with operations in Russia are scrambling to adjust to heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West, and to the ensuing turmoil that has gripped Russian markets. Energy giants BP and Shell are among companies looking to reduce ties with Russia. read more  "Raiffeisen Bank International does not have any plans to leave Russia," a spokesperson for RBI (RBIV.VI) in Vienna said, declining any further comment.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.  A second person said RBI could exit Russia and Ukraine by handing over ownership to another entity, without giving details. A temporary suspension of activity was also an option, that person said.  Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said Moscow would temporarily curb foreigners seeking to sell assets, complicating any attempts to quit the country. read more  RBI's stock price extended losses following the report it is studying a potential exit from Russia.  The company's Russian business said in a statement: "Raiffeisenbank plans to secure uninterrupted availability of its financial services for the clients based on existing legislation and the regulator's orders."  The potential cost to RBI of quitting Russia and Ukraine is unclear. Both sources said it was financially robust enough to withstand any stoppage of its banking operations there.  The second source said any decision to leave Russia would have to be done in coordination with the central bank, which might impose its own conditions.  Austria's finance ministry said this week that RBI was "well positioned for all eventualities."  RBI has invested 2.4 billion euros in its Russian subsidiary, which had assets worth 11.96 billion euros at the end of last year.  Writing off both would cut just over 100 basis points off the group's Core Equity Tier 1 ratio - a key gauge of financial strength - of 13.14%, according to Reuters calculations.  That does not take into account any profit from bets the bank has made against the rouble as a 1.4 billion euro "hedge" against its exposure to the currency, which would reduce the capital hit.  On top of that, RBI's full-year results presentation shows it had an exposure of 1.6 billion euros to Russia and 170 million euros to Ukraine, which it said was mainly booked via its corporates and markets unit at the group level.

Pavel Golovkin/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo  Summary  Summary Companies Fridman and Aven: EU is wrong to sanction us  Fridman: the war in Ukraine should stop  Aven and Fridman: EU claims are false and defamatory  LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - After some of Russia's richest oligarchs were cut out the global financial system, billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven vowed to contest European Union sanctions imposed in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.  Russia's economy is facing one of the gravest crises since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed crippling sanctions on almost all of the Russian financial and corporate system following the Kremlin's order for a military operation.  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the "special military operation" is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Some of the so-called oligarchs who built fortunes in the chaos of the 1990s, including Fridman, who was born in western Ukraine, have in recent days publicly called for peace.  But the EU on Monday slapped sanctions on both Fridman and Aven, long-term partners who earned billions of dollars from oil, banking and retail. Both said the EU's allegations were false and defamatory and that they would contest them.  "These sanctions are groundless and unfair," Fridman told reporters in English. "I don't know if I will be sanctioned by the UK and U.S. - I hope it will not happen."  Fridman, who is a UK tax resident, cast the war in Ukraine as a tragedy and said it should stop but refrained from saying more, citing the sensitivities of commenting on politics in Russia.  "For me that's a huge tragedy what is going on," Fridman said. "The war should be stopped."  Fridman did not set out how he and Aven would go about contesting the EU sanctions. In a joint statement, Fridman and Aven they said they would "contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them."  OLIGARCHS  Western leaders say sanctioning Russia's richest men puts pressure on Putin, though many oligarchs say the West is naive if it thinks Putin will listen to the views of businessmen, especially on matters of national security.  "Whatever happens with me will not have any impact on the political decisions in Russia," Fridman said. He questioned why Russians - just because they were Russian - should be prevented from doing business outside Russia.  The EU said Aven "is one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs" and that Fridman had been "referred to as a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle."  Aven said it was wrong of the EU to say that he was an "especially close personal friend" of Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. Fridman said it was untrue that he had “cultivated strong ties” to the administration of Vladimir Putin.  They denied any "financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin."  Fridman is the co-founder of LetterOne, or L1, which has long-term investments of more than 25 billion pounds ($33.5 billion) in the technology, energy, health and retail sectors.  Fridman and his partners also control Alfa Group, which includes Russia's top private bank Alfa Bank and its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group .  He said there would be a "petty drastic" impact on the Russian economy with the rouble under pressure, inflation rising and incomes falling. "It still will exist is my guess - I don't think the economy will disappear."  Asked if Putin would face a popular backlash in Russia over the invasion, Fridman said: "I just don't know."

REUTERS/Stringer  BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - China and Russia have grown increasingly close in recent years, including as trading partners, a relationship that brings both opportunities and risks as Russia reels from tough new sanctions led by the West in response to its invasion of Ukraine.  Total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.9% last year to a record $146.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Russia serving as a major source of oil, gas, coal and agriculture commodities, running a trade surplus with China.  Since sanctions were imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea, bilateral trade has expanded by more than 50% and China has become Russia's biggest export destination. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reuters Graphics  The two were aiming to boost total trade to $200 billion by 2024, but according to a new target unveiled last month during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing for the Winter Olympics, the two sides want bilateral trade to grow to $250 billion.  As sanctions against Russia mount, China could offset some of its neighbour's pain by buying more, but would also be wary of running foul itself of potential sanctions.  Below are key areas of trade cooperation between China and Russia.  OIL AND GAS  Exports of Russian oil and gas to China have steadily increased. Russia is China's second-biggest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia, with volumes averaging 1.59 million barrels per day last year, or 15.5% of Chinese imports.  About 40% of supplies flow via the 4,070-km (2,540-mile) East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline that was financed by $50 billion in Chinese loans.  Russia is also Beijing's No. 3 gas supplier, exporting 16.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of the fuel to China in 2021, meeting about 5% of Chinese demand.  Supplies via the Power of Siberia pipeline, which is not connected to the network of westbound Russian gas pipelines, began in late 2019 and are due to rise to 38 bcm a year by 2025, up from 10.5 bcm in 2021, under a 30-year contract worth more than $400 billion.  Russia aims to build a second gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2, with capacity for 50 bcm a year to run via Mongolia to China.  Russia was also China's No. 2 coal supplier in 2021.  Last month, Putin unveiled new Russian oil and gas deals with China worth an estimated $117.5 billion. read more  FOOD TRADE  Russia's food trade with China is small but expanding.  In 2019, China allowed the import of soybeans from all regions of Russia, and the two countries signed a deal to deepen cooperation in soybean supply chains, which saw more Chinese firms growing the beans in Russia.  Soybean exports to China stood at 543,058 tonnes last year and are expected to reach 3.7 million tonnes by 2024.  In 2021, China approved beef imports from Russia, while last Friday, it allowed imports of wheat from all regions of Russia.  Other food exports from Russia to China include fish, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, poultry, wheat flour and chocolate.  China is also a huge buyer of timber from Russia's Far East, with imports of timber and related products worth $4.1 billion last year.  In the other direction, China sells mechanical products, machinery and transport equipment, mobile phones, cars and consumer products to Russia. Chinese exports to Russia stood at $67.6 billion last year, up 34%.  INVESTMENT  Western sanctions have forced Russia to look toward China for investment opportunities in recent years, and Chinese state banks have helped Russia finance everything from infrastructure to oil and gas projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative.  Russia is by far Beijing's largest recipient of state sector financing, securing 107 loans and export credits worth $125 billion from Chinese state institutions between 2000 and 2017, data from the College of William and Mary's AidData research lab showed.  China and Russia began using their own currencies to settle bilateral trade in 2010 and opened their first currency swap line in 2014, which they renewed in 2020 for 150 billion yuan over three years.  Yuan settlements accounted for 28% of Chinese exports to Russia in the first half of 2021, compared with just 2% in 2013, as both countries seek to ease reliance on the dollar while developing their own respective cross-border payment systems.  The Chinese currency accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves in June 2021, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017, with Moscow's dollar holdings dropping to 16.4% from 46.3% in the same period. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Stella Qiu, Aizhu Chen and Tony Munroe; Additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Jacqueline Wong  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden, who has earned praise for his efforts to rally European allies and other nations against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, will turn to uniting Americans in the State of the Union speech on Tuesday.  With the conflict in Ukraine raging, Biden intends to use the annual speech to stress the importance of countering Putin and push his domestic economic agenda, including reintroducing elements of his stalled Build Back Better program, administration officials said.  "Every State of Union speech also reflects a moment of time," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. Biden, she said, will detail his efforts "to rally the world to stand up for democracy and against Russian aggression."  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Democrats are expected to have a difficult time holding control of the U.S. House of Representatives – and perhaps the Senate as well - in the Nov. 8 elections, analysts said, which would likely cripple Biden’s policy goals.  A rebound in Biden’s public standing would make the task of staying in power easier.  "The (speech) comes at a good time,” said John Geer, a political scientist and an expert in public opinion at Vanderbilt University. "He needs to grab the national stage and set a course that offers a brighter future."  Biden should tout his work helping the world resist Putin’s advances, Geer said, while celebrating the effectiveness of vaccines and other mitigation measures that have brought about a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases and easing of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Public opinion polls have shown Biden out of favor with the majority of Americans for months. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken last week, showed him at 43% approval.  Even with the jobless rate at 4%, most voters remain pessimistic about the economy largely due to skyrocketing consumer prices. A quarter of Democrats think the party has failed to take advantage of its rare control of the White House and both houses of Congress. read more  While aides believe Biden's perceived strength in handling COVID helped him win the presidency, some voters, especially Republicans, think the country has not moved quickly enough to ease pandemic restrictions as case counts have fallen.  On Tuesday, members of Congress attending Biden's speech at the U.S. Capitol will not be required to wear masks for the first time in months, a sight that could provide helpful optics for the president.  U.S. ECONOMY, RUSSIA SANCTIONS  Biden must convince viewers at home that the economy is, in fact, in solid shape despite inflation concerns, and that tough sanctions imposed by the Washington and allies are worth the pain. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause gasoline prices to skyrocket in the United States, adding to the highest inflation rate in 40 years.  About two-thirds of Americans support Biden slapping Russia with economic sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. read more  At the same time, security at home is an issue. Federal authorities are reinstalling fencing around the Capitol as Washington prepares for planned trucker protests inspired by demonstrations in Canada against pandemic-related restrictions. L1N2V20N0  It is unclear how disruptive the convoys, coming from various points around the country, will be. At least one of the planned convoys is still in the Midwest and not expected to arrive in Washington until the weekend, local media reported. The Pentagon last week approved the use of 700 National Guards members to help with traffic control support.  Biden can also trumpet his $1-trillion infrastructure bill that was passed last year with some Republican support.  He likely will urge swift confirmation of his pick for the U.S. Supreme Court, federal appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first Black woman on the high court.  Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a moderate Democrat think tank, said that Biden should aim for a sweeping tone about U.S. leadership on the world stage and the economy.  "The most important thing,” Bennett said, “is that he shows America that he is in command of world and domestic events. No policy idea or accomplishment is going to make a real difference."

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo  March 1 (Reuters) - As public schools around the United States lift COVID-19 mask mandates, parents are divided over the issue, with nearly 43% saying face covering requirements should remain in place to prevent virus transmission, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).  Most parents who responded also expressed concern about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children under age 5, saying they do not have enough information, according to the KFF survey of 1,502 adults conducted between Feb. 9 and 21.  Support for masks in schools has been falling since September, when two thirds of people and over 60% of parents favored some level of mask requirements, KFF said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention drastically eased its guidelines for when people should wear masks indoors, including in schools. About 72% of the U.S. population now reside in communities where indoor face coverings are no longer recommended under the new CDC guidelines. read more  Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration postponed its review of the Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children under five, saying it needed more time to review new data. read more  The survey found that ahead of any FDA decision, nearly two-thirds of parents said they are not confident about the safety of existing shots for children under the age of five.  The report shows that overall U.S. COVID-19 vaccine uptake in February remained relatively unchanged from January.  About 25% of U.S. adults were still unvaccinated including one-in-six who say they will "definitely not" get vaccinated, the report found.  With U.S. mid-term elections approaching in November and COVID numbers falling nationwide, the pandemic was no longer among the top-four issues of most concern for registered voters, the survey found.  However, healthcare costs was listed fourth among major issues that will be most important to voters in the upcoming election, after the economy and inflation, voting rights and foreign policy. The survey was completed prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Voters will also pick their parties' nominees for the U.S. House of Representatives and other statewide offices in primary elections that will provide the first test of a wave of new restrictions on voting passed in response to Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.  The results will offer clues about the mood of American voters who decide on Nov. 8 which party will control Congress for the rest of President Joe Biden's four-year term in office.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The voting comes the same day that Biden -- struggling with low public approval and facing a major foreign policy crisis in Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- delivers his annual State of the Union address to the American people.  Midterms typically serve as a referendum on the sitting president, and Republicans are favored to win a majority in at least one of the two chambers of Congress that Democrats control by razor-thin margins. Doing so would allow them to block Biden's legislative agenda and to launch potentially damaging investigations into his administration.  Texas's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, is running for a third term, despite his pending 2015 indictment for securities fraud. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing and has been endorsed by former President Trump.  His Republican opponents include firebrand U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert, Land Commissioner George P. Bush, grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman.  Under Texas law, if no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the two top vote-getters advance to a runoff election on May 24.  LARGE NUMBERS OF BALLOTS REJECTED  Republican lawmakers and Abbott muscled sweeping new voting restrictions through the state legislature last year over objections from Democrats and civil rights groups. In the past few weeks, elections officials in several counties have reported an unprecedented number of rejected mail-in ballots due to new identification requirements. read more  Abbott has pursued increasingly conservative policies during his second term, including opposing COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates, signing the country's most restrictive abortion ban and supporting a Mexico border wall. read more  Last week, Abbott instructed state agencies to consider medical treatment for transgender adolescents as child abuse, days after Paxton issued a legal opinion to that effect. While the legal effect of the order remains unclear, transgender advocates decried the move as discriminatory and dangerous.  Abbott's most notable opponents, former Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West and former state Senator Don Huffines, lag far behind; polls suggest Abbott is likely to avoid a runoff altogether. The governor secured Trump's endorsement last summer and has nearly $50 million in campaign money.  "Abbott has not left much room to the right of him for these competitors to gain any traction," said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. "He's had his foot on the gas pedal in a perpetual right turn."  O'Rourke, a formidable fundraiser in his own right who ran a surprisingly strong but unsuccessful run for Senate in 2018, has taken in more than $13 million since launching his campaign in November. He reported having $6.7 million on hand as of Feb. 19.  The Democrat has attacked Abbott for his handling of the state's power grid, which failed during a series of winter storms that killed hundreds in February 2021.  Abbott has sought to tie O'Rourke to national Democrats, including Biden, at every opportunity, pointing to statement's from O'Rourke's brief 2020 presidential campaign to portray him as far too liberal for Texas.  Among congressional races, Republican-backed redistricting has eliminated virtually every competitive district, but some primaries will provide early looks at how each party is navigating internal tensions.  In the 28th District in south Texas, incumbent Representative Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative House Democrats, will face progressive Jessica Cisneros for the second time.  Either could prove vulnerable in November. Federal investigators searched Cuellar's home recently, though Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing. Cisneros, who is closely aligned with liberals such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, may be susceptible to Republican attacks that she is too extreme.  Republicans have their own proxy battle in the 8th District, where House leadership has backed former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell. But Trump acolytes in the House favor Christian Collins, a former campaign aide to Senator Ted Cruz.  The 15th District, perhaps the most competitive seat this fall, has a crowded field for both parties after incumbent Democrat Vicente Gonzalez opted to run in a neighboring district. Republicans are hopeful they can flip the seat in November after Trump showed unexpected strength among Hispanic voters in 2020.

Under Texas law, if no candidate earns a majority of the vote in any given election, the two top finishers head to a runoff on May 24. Here are some key races to watch:  CHALLENGES TO GOVERNOR ABBOT  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Polls show Republican Governor Greg Abbott is likely to avoid a runoff against his two leading opponents, former Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West and former state Senator Don Huffines. Both have tried to portray Abbott as insufficiently conservative.  DEMOCRAT O'ROURKE SEEKS NOMINATION  With no significant primary opposition, former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke has focused his attacks on Abbott, accusing him of failing to fix the power grid that failed spectacularly during a deadly series of winter storms last year.  WILL PAXTON SURVIVE?  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has already won one reelection campaign since his indictment in 2015 on state securities fraud charges. This time around, he faces a trio of notable opponents: Land Commissioner George P. Bush, grandson of former President George H. W. Bush; firebrand U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert and Eva Guzman, a former state Supreme Court justice.  TRUMP LOYALTY TEST  Republican Representative Van Taylor comfortably won a second term in Texas' 3rd District in 2020, even though Trump barely outperformed Biden in the district. But Taylor's vote to support the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters has attracted Republican opponents who accuse him of betraying the former president and his party.  After redistricting, the suburban Dallas district is significantly more conservative in 2022, potentially making Taylor vulnerable to a challenge from the right. His leading rival is Keith Self, a former judge in Collin County who has attacked Taylor for his vote, even though the measure failed in the Senate. House Democrats have launched their own Jan. 6 probe.  A SUCCESSOR TO KEVIN BRADY  The race to succeed 13-term Congressman Kevin Brady in the heavily Republican 8th District, north of Houston, has split many of the state's top Republicans between two leading candidates.  Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL, is backed by a political action committee with ties to Republican congressional leadership, as well as Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, former Governor Rick Perry and U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw. Luttrell is the twin brother of Marcus Luttrell, also a Navy SEAL, who wrote the bestselling memoir "Lone Survivor."  Christian Collins, a conservative activist, is supported by the campaign arm of the House's right-wing Freedom Caucus.  REPUBLICANS GAINING GROUND  The elongated 15th District, which stretches south from the San Antonio area to the Rio Grande, is held by Democrats but was already competitive in 2020 thanks to Trump's unexpected strength among Hispanic Texans before Republicans redrew the lines in last fall's redistricting to be more favorable to them. The incumbent, Vicente Gonzalez, decided to run for reelection in the neighboring 34th District, leaving half a dozen Democrats vying for the party's nod.  The Republican front-runner is Monica De La Cruz, who narrowly lost to Gonzalez in 2020. The race could be the state's most closely contested congressional battle this fall.  DEMOCRATIC REMATCH  The Democratic primary in the South Texas 28th District will be a rematch: Jessica Cisneros, a liberal backed by Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing Justice Democrats, will again challenge nine-term incumbent Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, after a close 2020 contest.  An FBI raid at Cuellar's house in January has given Cisneros a boost. The agency has not commented on the matter, and Cuellar, who has not been charged with a crime, has said he is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.  PROGRESSIVE PUSH  The solidly Democratic 35th District, stretching from San Antonio to Austin, will also be a test of the party's left wing. Greg Casar, a democratic socialist and former Austin city council member, is backed by high-profile liberals including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ocasio-Cortez.  Casar faces several challengers, including state Representative Eddie Rodriguez. The incumbent, Democrat Lloyd Doggett, has opted to run in the newly created 37th District based in Austin.  BLACK REPUBLICAN VETERAN  One of two new congressional seats this year thanks to Texas' booming population, the 38th District stretches northwest from Houston and was drawn by Republicans to be safely conservative.  Wesley Hunt, a Black conservative and Army veteran who narrowly lost to Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 in a race that earned national attention, has emerged as the leading candidate for Republicans. He has been endorsed by Cruz, as well as House Republican leaders, though he faces several challengers.

Johnson was taking questions from journalists at the British Embassy in Warsaw when Daria Kaleniuk, a Ukrainian activist from the NGO Anti-Corruption Action Centre told him that Ukrainians needed a no-fly zone.  "Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are coming from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the West to protect our sky," she said, her voice reverberating with emotion.

Britain, along with fellow nuclear powers the United States and Russia, is a signatory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum under which Ukraine gave up its own atomic weapons in return for security guarantees.  1/6 Daria Kaleniuk, activist from NGO Anticorruption Action Centre speaks at a news conference at the British Embassy in Warsaw, Poland, March 1, 2022. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Read More  In response, Johnson said that there was "not enough that we can do as the UK government to help ... the way that you want."  "The implication of that (no fly zone) is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be in direct combat with Russia. That's not something that we can do or that we've envisaged."  Speaking to Reuters after the question-and-answer session, Kaleniuk condemned what she said was Britain's refusal to stand by the security commitments it made almost three decades ago and said a no-fly zone was essential in order to get humanitarian aid to central and eastern Ukraine.  "Ukrainian children are sitting in shelters in the bombardments and UK and the United States are saying sorry we will not go into war against Russia, we will not protect your sky ... because we are simply afraid of World War Three," she said.

The board of the IAEA "condemns in the strongest terms the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine", the draft text seen by Reuters said.

The family, whose father stayed behind to fight, travelled in two cars carrying Ivan's three sisters, two aunts and grandmother.  New arrivals continued to pour across central European border crossings, with news of fierce fighting, civilian deaths and the massive Russian convoy stoking worries of those fleeing the war. read more  Across central Europe, authorities set up makeshift reception centres in tents where people could get medical aid and process asylum papers, while thousands of volunteers have driven to the borders with donations of food, blankets and clothes.  Most of the refugees escaping the war have crossed into the European Union from borders in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.  Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has welcomed a big chunk of the arrivals. The Polish Border Guard said that over 377,400 people had so far entered from Ukraine , with around 24,000 arriving on Tuesday since 7 a.m. local time.  At the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest along its roughly 500-kilometre (310 miles) border with Ukraine, people huddled around a bonfire in freezing temperatures as they waited for buses to take them to reception centres. Discarded bottles, clothes and other items littered the road, and a few hundred people gathered near a local grocery store.  Also at the crossing was Ibrahima Sory Keita, who had arrived in Meliptopol three weeks ago from Guinea to begin studies.  Cities under siege across Ukraine are home to tens of thousands of African students studying medicine, engineering and military affairs. Thousands of Indian students are also trying to flee.  Keita and a few friends raced to the border when fighting broke out, walking the final 45 kilometres on foot.  "Everything hurts right now," he said after crossing the border. "I haven't had a chance to lie down for 4 days. I am shaking (from cold) and I need to sleep in a warm place."  Some refugees were met by family members already working in the European Union who waited at the many border crossings, while local residents and officials across the region offered apartments and set up reception centres for temporary lodging.  Hungarian police reported that more than 60,000 people have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion while nearly 90,000 have entered Romania.  At some border crossing, queues on the Ukrainian side stretched back for kilometres.  At the Budapest train station a newly-arrived Ukrainian man in his 60s met by volunteer workers worried about his sons who stayed behind in Kyiv and wondered whether he would ever return to his home.  "I think this war will be very long in time," said Amir, who did not want to give his last name. "I left my house, my car, all of my profit in my life, I left all. We have nothing now."

The visit, led by one-time chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, comes at a time when Taiwan has stepped up its alert level, wary of China taking advantage of a distracted West to move against it.  Beijing claims the democratically governed island as its own and has vowed to bring it under Chinese control, by force if necessary.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who served as the top U.S. military officer under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, is being accompanied by Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser under Bush, and Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense under Obama.  Two former National Security Council senior directors for Asia, Mike Green and Evan Medeiros, are also on the trip, which is intended to "demonstrate our continued robust support for Taiwan," a U.S. official told Reuters.  The group touched down in a private jet at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport and were met by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.  They will meet President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday, the same day former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will also arrive, though he is coming separately and as a private citizen.  China describes Taiwan as the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States, and any high-level interactions upset Beijing.  "The will of the Chinese people to defend our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity is immovable. Whoever United States sends to show support for Taiwan is bound to fail," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said of the visit.  Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the trip showed "the importance both of the Taiwan-U.S. relationship and Taiwan's position" as well as the staunch U.S. support for the island.  "It's a very good thing," he added.  Their flight, from Washington via Anchorage, made an unusual arrival, flying down Japan's Ryukyu Islands before turning to approach Taipei from Taiwan's northeast coast and well away from China, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed.  The more normal approach path for their direction of travel is over the East China Sea.  On Saturday, a U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which China described as "provocative". read more  Wang went further on Tuesday, using even stronger terms.  "If United States is trying to threaten and pressure China with this then we need to tell them that in the face of the Great Wall of steel forged by 1.4 billion Chinese people, any military deterrence is but scrap metal," he said.  "The gimmick of having a U.S. warship sail through the Taiwan Strait should be left to those who foolishly believe in hegemony."

The Taliban administration's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had said at a media conference on Sunday that Afghans would not be allowed to leave the country unless they had a clear destination and that women could not travel overseas for study without a male guardian.  Hugo Shorter, the UK charge d'affaires for Afghanistan, said in a Tweet on Monday they had seen the Taliban's statements.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "These would be unacceptable restrictions on freedom of movement," he said. "I call on the Taliban to clarify their remarks urgently."  It was not immediately clear whether the plans would hamper the efforts by international governments and organisations to evacuate thousands of Afghans who had worked with foreign embassies, militaries and projects and were eligible for asylum in Western countries but still in Afghanistan.  A U.S. State Department spokesperson said late on Monday they were engaging with the Taliban over the issue.  "We have seen the Taliban statements reported in the press and have raised our concerns with the Taliban," the spokesperson said.  "Our ability to facilitate relocation for our Afghan allies depends on the Taliban living up to its commitment of free passage," the spokesperson added.  Mujahid said the Taliban's travel restrictions would apply to Afghans who worked with NATO and American forces, but did not elaborate under what, if any, circumstances they would be able to evacuate.  "We will not allow Afghans to leave the country unless their destinations are known," Mujahid said.  Mujahid blamed poor conditions in countries where some Afghans were being held while their visas were processed after thousands were evacuated, at times without finalised visas, by withdrawing foreign forces in the wake of the Taliban's take-over of the country in August.  Regular evacuation flights organised by the United States via Qatar were largely stopped in December over disagreement by the Taliban administration on who should be able to board, sources had told Reuters.

Last November, The United States announced a release of 50 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move made in concert with oil consuming nations including China, India and Japan.

Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS  VIENNA, March 1 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday the war in Ukraine should be stopped and accused the "mafia-like regime" of the United States of creating the conflict.  Russia, whose troops invaded Ukraine last week, is a strategic partner for Iran, which has been under Western sanctions for years. While Tehran and Washington have been foes for decades, Iran and Russia have deepened trade ties and have been allies in the Syrian conflict.  "The U.S. regime creates crises, lives off of crises and feeds on various crises in the world. Ukraine is another victim of this policy," Khamenei said in a televised speech.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "In my view, Ukraine is a victim of the crises concocted by the United States," he said. "There are two lessons to be learnt here. States which depend on the support of the U.S. and Western powers need to know they cannot trust such countries."  Khamenei criticised Washington and other Western nations as talks reached a critical stage in Vienna between Iran and world powers about reviving a 2015 nuclear deal.  Despite progress in the talks, the key sticking point is Tehran wants the issue of uranium traces found at several old but undeclared sites in Iran to be dropped and closed forever, an Iranian official told Reuters.  Iran said on Monday efforts to revive the pact could succeed if the United States took a political decision to meet Tehran's remaining demands, as months of negotiations enter what one Iranian diplomat called a "now or never" stage.  The stakes are high, because the failure of 10 months of talks could carry the risk of a fresh regional war, more harsh sanctions on Iran by the West and continued upward pressure on world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict.  Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman has said the remaining issues included the extent to which sanctions would be rolled back and providing guarantees that the United States would not quit the pact again.  All parties involved in the talks say progress has been made toward the restoration of the pact to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, which the United States abandoned in 2018. But both Tehran and Washington have said there are still some significant differences to overcome.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer  ANKARA, March 1 (Reuters) - Turkey is calling on all sides in the Ukraine crisis to respect an international pact on passage through the Turkish straits to the Black Sea, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was cited as saying on Tuesday after Ankara closed access.  NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Ankara has the right to limit transit through its straits during wartime.  This allows it to curb Russian warships going to the Black Sea. The pact grants exemption to ships returning to their home bases. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was cited by state media as saying that Turkey had demanded all Black Sea and non-Black Sea states to halt passage through its straits. read more  "Eroding Montreux or disrupting the status quo in any way is to nobody's benefit. We see a benefit in preserving Montreux. We tell all sides that it would be beneficial to abide by Montreux," Akar told reporters after Monday's cabinet meeting, his ministry said.  In a call on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken "expressed his appreciation" to Cavusoglu for Turkey's implementation of the accord, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.  Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy, told Reuters that Turkey had closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to all states.  "So it's really happened, it's closed... It's closed to all maritime traffic, not only to Russian ships," Isik said, adding the closure should be seen as Ankara giving Moscow "breathing room" to determine its position.  At least four Russian ships are waiting to cross from the Mediterranean.  While calling Russia's invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which Ankara has close ties in energy, defence and tourism. It has called for dialogue and offered to host peace talks.  Late on Monday, President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko about ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine on Belarus' border, his office said.  "We are determined to use the powers the Montreux Convention grants our country to ease the crisis," Erdogan said after the cabinet meeting. "We will surely not compromise on our national interests, but we will also not disregard regional and global balances. This is why we cannot abandon ties with Russia or Ukraine."  While forging close ties with Russia, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine and signed a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. It also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its 2014 annexation of Crimea.  "Turkey is really doing its best, or you can see it bends over backwards not to offend Russia," Isik said.

A priority was to reach people detained during the conflict and the ICRC is in touch with all sides regarding visits to detainees, he said.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse  Summary Russian and Belarusian athletes should be suspended from all sport, says IOC  Russian Olympic Committee says it categorically disagrees with IOC  IOC withdraws Olympic Order from Russian President Putin  Feb 28 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee's executive board has recommended sports federations to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing in events following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The IOC said the executive board made the decision "in order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants" and that the body was acting with a "heavy heart".  The Russian Olympic Committee categorically disagreed with the IOC, saying the decision "contradicts both the regulatory documents of the IOC and the (Olympic) Charter".  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "As a first step, we consider it necessary to send requests to international federations for an official response on the status of Russian athletes and their rights to participate in international competitions due to the fact that it is the... federations that have the authority to admit athletes to international competitions in the respective sport," the ROC said in a statement.  "For its part, the Russian Olympic Committee intends to consistently uphold the rights and interests of Russian athletes and provide all necessary assistance to our national federations to challenge discriminatory decisions of the relevant international federations."  The statement from IOC comes shortly before the Winter Paralympics starts in Beijing on Friday. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss Russia ahead of the Games. read more  Following IOC's statement, soccer governing bodies FIFA and UEFA also suspended Russia's national and club teams from all competitions until further notice.  Sports bodies across the world have already moved against Russia by refusing to host or play against teams from the country. read more  The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and its athletes advisory council sought a complete ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials effectively immediately and inclusive of the Beijing Paralympics.  "As the world watches in horror while Russia brazenly attacks the innocent people and athletes of Ukraine, this is the only acceptable action to be taken until peace has been restored," the USOPC said in a statement late on Monday.  IOC'S STATEMENT 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS'  Athletes from Ukraine and other nations have urged the IOC and IPC to suspend Russia and Belarus ban their athletes from events immediately. read more  Global Athlete, an international athlete-led movement that aims to inspire change in world sport, said it was "angry and appalled" by the IOC's statement.  "The IOC has once again only made smoke and mirror recommendations and refuses to take action against Russia and Belarus," Global Athlete Director-General Rob Koehler told Reuters in a statement.  "In addition, the Paralympics start in days and the International Paralympic Committee's silence and lack of action speak volumes that they are also aligned with Russia and favour politics over principles and Russian interests over athlete interests.  "Athletes are calling for all Russian and Belarusian athletes to be banned from the 2022 Beijing Paralympic Games. Athletes globally have lost confidence in the Olympic and Paralympic movements."  The IOC also strongly urged federations to ensure that no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus would be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus.  "Russian or Belarusian nationals, be it as individuals or teams, should be accepted only as neutral athletes or neutral teams. No national symbols, colours, flags or anthems should be displayed," the statement added.  However, the board said that in very extreme circumstances, the board would leave it to the relevant organisations to effectively address the dilemma.  "In this context, the IOC EB considered in particular the upcoming Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and reiterated its full support for the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the Games," the statement added.  OLYMPIC ORDER WITHDRAWN FROM PUTIN  The IOC reiterated its recommendation not to organise any sports event in Russia or Belarus.  The IOC also said it had taken the ad hoc decision to withdraw the Olympic Order from all persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The Olympic Order is the highest award granted by the Olympic movement and Putin was the recipient of a gold honour in 2001.  Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko and Dmitry Kozak, deputy chief of staff of the presidential executive office, have also been stripped of their titles.  The IOC said it made the decision based on "the exceptional circumstances of the situation and considering the extremely grave violation of the Olympic Truce and other violations of the Olympic Charter by the Russian government in the past".  Ukraine's health ministry said on Sunday that 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since Russia's invasion of the country last week. Belarus has been a key staging area for the invasion.  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan  LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 1 (Reuters) - Asia's imports of coal slumped in February as prices remained close to record highs for both thermal and coking grades, and the crisis in Ukraine means the cost of the fuel is unlikely to retreat any time soon.  Seaborne imports of all grades of coal across Asia, the top-consuming region for the polluting fuel, fell to 59.27 million tonnes in February from 61.92 million in January, according to port and vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.  This was the lowest monthly total in Refinitiv data dating back to January 2015, and was also some 13% below the 68.15 million tonnes the continent imported by ship in February 2021.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  A milder winter across north Asia, high prices and the lingering effects of Indonesia's short-lived export ban for the month of January are the most likely culprits behind the drop in February import volumes.  China, the world's biggest coal importer, has recorded a weak start to 2022, with February imports of 11.65 million tonnes marginally higher than January's 11.27 million, but the combined total for the first two months of the year is the lowest Refinitiv has assessed.  Imports in the first two months of 22.92 million tonnes are 46.2% below the 42.58 million recorded in the first two months of last year, according to Refinitiv.  India, the second-biggest importer, brought in 10.93 million tonnes of coal in February, down a touch from January's 11.06 million. The combined total for the first two months is 31% adrift of the 31.83 million for the same period in 2021.  Third-ranked Japan imported 12.71 million tonnes in February, down from January's 15.62 million and a decline of 7% for the first two months of 2022 compared to the same period last year.  South Korea, Asia's fourth-biggest coal importer, saw arrivals of 7.37 million tonnes in February, down from January's 10.2 million, but unlike the region's big three, this was actually a modest 4% gain on the first two months of 2021.  It's perhaps not surprising that coal imports were lower in Asia at the start of this year, given the winter just ended was milder than the previous winter of 2020-21.  But high prices are also likely to have played a part in the drop in volumes, especially for price sensitive buyers such as India and Pakistan.  Some cargoes delivered across Asia in February would have been bought at spot prices that prevailed in January, when regional benchmarks shot higher as the world's top exporter of thermal coal, Indonesia, implemented a ban on exports in order to ensure supplies for domestic power plants.  The benchmark Newcastle Index for Australian thermal coal , as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, leapt from $175.25 a tonne at the end of 2021 to a record high of $264.52 a tonne in the week to Feb. 25.  The crisis in global energy markets created by Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine last week has seen the Newcastle price climb even higher, with futures traded on the ICE exchange ending at $275 a tonne on Monday.  In the physical market globalCOAL reported the bid/offer component for Newcastle coal at $287.50 a tonne on Feb. 25, while similar grade South African coal for export at Richards Bay was assessed at $247.50.  SEASONAL PRICE RETREAT POSTPONED?  In more normal circumstances it may be expected that the combination of high prices, lower import volumes and the end of the northern winter would result in downward pressure on prices.  But the crisis in Ukraine has upended normal expectations.  Russia remains a major coal supplier to Asia, and while sanctions against Moscow have yet to target energy exports, it's likely that an increasing number of traders, utilities, banks and insurers will effectively self-sanction.  Russia shipped 7.06 million tonnes of coal to customers in Asia in February, down slightly from 7.26 million in January, according to data from commodity consultants Kpler.  Major buyers included China with 1.89 million tonnes in February, South Korea with 1.58 million, Taiwan 879,000 and Japan 831,000, according to Kpler.  If these buyers decide that Russian coal is no longer desirable or feasible to import, this is going to put pressure on supplies from other sources, such as Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and the United States.  Uncertainty is likely to keep coal prices well bid, even as high prices contribute to demand destruction in Asia.  The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Picture taken July 17, 2020. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo  FORT COLLINS, Colo., Feb 28 (Reuters) - The stoppage of grain exports out of Ukraine was confirmed on Monday as the country said all ports will be closed until the end of the Russian invasion, though there is a chance that supplies for the next season out of both Ukraine and Russia could also be in jeopardy pending the outcome of the war.  Spring grain planting is right around the corner for both countries, most importantly corn for Ukraine and spring wheat for Russia, and it is unclear whether the ongoing conflict will impact production either physically or economically.  Ukraine accounts for 16% of world corn and 12% of world wheat exports, and top wheat supplier Russia covers 17% of trade. Ukraine still has a good deal of its 2021 corn crop to ship and Russia has yet to plant 30% of its 2022 wheat crop.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Ukraine and the United States are the lone world corn suppliers while Argentina and Brazil’s crops are in progress. Although Ukraine’s accumulated exports are up sharply from last year’s thin season, the shipment stall comes at a bad time since there is still a lot of progress left.  As of last Monday, the country had exported 18.7 million tonnes of corn out of the 33.8 million the agriculture ministry predicts for the 2021-22 season ending June 30. Ukraine announced on Monday its ports would stay closed through the invasion and reported damage to some facilities. read more  Even if ports were open, international traders would likely hesitate to send vessels to Ukraine. Two commercial ships were hit by Russian missiles on Friday near the Ukrainian port of Odessa. read more  Ukrainian farmers harvested a record corn crop in 2021-22 of 42 million tonnes, though they had been apprehensive late last year as to whether they could repeat in 2022-23 due to high input costs, but now the conflict may put the physical planting into question.  More than 95% of Ukraine’s wheat is winter-sown and most of it is in good condition, but farmers planted notably fewer hectares than originally expected based on the high costs of nitrogen fertilizers and gas as well as dry weather.  Russia’s winter crop accounts for about 70% of total output, meaning 30% has yet to be planted, and it is unclear whether recent economic troubles would impact growers’ ability to secure inputs or financing. Russia’s currency surged to an all-time low Monday on harsh economic sanctions from the West. read more  Russia’s spring wheat is planted in the Siberian, Ural and Volga Districts and is heaviest in May, lasting into June. Spring wheat yields are much lower on average than winter ones and can be more volatile.  An interruption to 2022-23 grain supplies in Ukraine would be easily noticeable as the majority goes to exports and little gets put into storage. Ukraine ships more than two-thirds of its annual wheat harvest and 80% of its corn.  Per U.S. Department of Agriculture data, Ukraine’s corn stocks-to-use in 2021-22 is about 3.5% for corn and 6.2% for wheat. That compares with the United States at 33% for wheat, an eight-year low, and 10% for corn, above last year but below the five-year average near 14%.  Russia ships only half of its wheat crop each year and it has more leftover at the end of the season versus Ukraine. USDA shows Russia’s 2021-22 stocks-to-use at 14%, close to typical levels.  A severe disruption in spring planting in Ukraine would also have a large impact on the global vegetable oil market as the Black Sea country supplies half of sunflower oil trade. Sunflowerseed plantings in Ukraine last year topped those for corn by at least 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres).  Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

But funds were a little less bullish than they had been in the middle of January, when the combined position was in the 70th percentile.  Bullish long positions outnumbered bearish short ones by a ratio of 5.80:1 (77th percentile), but the position was slightly less lopsided than the ratio of 6.24:1 (80th percentile) five weeks earlier.  Until the invasion began, investors seemed confident the intensifying conflict and sanctions would not disrupt oil exports from Russia.  Fears about inflation, the prospect of rising interest rates, and the likelihood of a nuclear deal between the United States and Iran resulting in more oil exports dominated concerns about the diplomatic situation in Ukraine.  Most fund managers were content to leave their bullish positions unchanged, but among the few who made adjustments, most were motivated by profit-taking after a months’ long rally, or anticipated a reversal in the trend.  In the most recent week, funds were sellers of NYMEX and ICE WTI (-21 million barrels), U.S. diesel (-2 million) and European gas oil (-5 million), but left U.S. gasoline unchanged, and purchased Brent (+13 million).  Funds have been net sellers of U.S. diesel and European gas oil combined for the last three weeks, after being buyers for the previous seven, reflecting growing unease about the sustainability of the economic recovery.  However, since then, the focus has shifted from the economy to the intensifying diplomatic and financial conflict between Russia on the one hand and the United States and the EU on the other.  The escalating conflict has gradually taken on the characteristics of unrestricted economic warfare, with the number of trading bans, asset freezes, confiscations and forced disposals multiplying rapidly.  Oil and gas prices have started to climb as traders anticipate economic warfare will eventually disrupt energy exports from Russia, even though both the U.S. and Russian governments insist this is not their intention.

REUTERS/  March 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) are among internet companies facing possible punitive measures in Russia after failing to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law.  Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices since July 2021 or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans.  In November, state communications regulator Roskomnadzor listed 13 companies it wanted to set up officially on Russian soil and last month said it would start imposing restrictions by the end of February.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Ahead of Monday's deadline, only a few had complied. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week has added to pressure on Western businesses to push back on Putin in any way possible. read more  The new rules also require companies to register with Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and have a system for fielding user complaints.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) had fully complied before fighting began in Ukraine, and Roskomnadzor's website on Monday also showed Rakuten Group Inc's (4755.T) messaging app Viber had completed all required steps.  Six other companies had fulfilled at least one policy but had not established a Russian legal entity or local office. Those were Google, Meta, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), ByteDance's TikTok, Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O), JOYY Inc's (YY.O) video app Likee, the government website showed late Monday.  Four companies - chat tool Discord, Amazon.com Inc's live streaming unit Twitch, messaging app Telegram and bookmarking service Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) - had taken no steps to comply, according to the website.  Likee said its Feb. 16 filing to form a Russian legal entity is under review and that it plans to comply with the law. Twitter declined to comment while the other 11 companies did not respond to requests for comment.  Last month, Roskomnadzor said it would begin barring non-compliant companies from selling ads in Russia. It previously has said blocking access to the targeted services would be a last resort, and that other penalties could include limiting data collection and money transfers.  The regulation is a part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom. Authorities in Russia have issued small fines to social media companies in the last year for ignoring their demands to censor anti-government activists or information.  Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation," has curtailed access to Facebook in recent days in retaliation for censoring state media services, which critics say promote fake news and propaganda. Twitter has also been slow to access on mobile devices.  Demand for virtual private networking (VPN) apps, which can help with circumventing internet restrictions, has surged in Russia amid the latest crackdown. Three of the top five most downloaded apps on Apple's App Store on Monday were VPNs, and they generated a combined 383,000 installs over the past seven days, 15 times more than the prior seven-day period, according to estimates from tracker Sensor Tower. read more  Russia, which has a population of about 144 million, had nearly 51 million users on Instagram and 7.5 million on Facebook as of last November, according to research outfit Insider Intelligence.

REUTERS/Dilara Senkaya/File Photo  Summary  Summary Companies Young TikTok users are posting videos of the Ukraine conflict  Ukrainian influencers give a glimpse of life during the invasion  Researchers warn misinformation about Ukraine is widespread  March 1 (Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine last week, some of social media's youngest users experienced the conflict from the front lines on TikTok.  Videos of people huddling and crying in windowless bomb shelters, explosions blasting through urban settings and missiles streaking across Ukrainian cities took over the app from its usual offerings of fashion, fitness and dance videos.  Ukrainian social media influencers uploaded bleak scenes of themselves wrapped in blankets in underground bunkers and army tanks rolling down residential streets, juxtaposed against photos of blooming flowers and laughing friends at restaurants that honored more peaceful memories of their hometowns.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  They urged their followers to pray for Ukraine, donate to support the Ukrainian military and demanded Russian users in particular to join anti-war efforts.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a "special operation," is the latest example of the central role TikTok has played in bringing news and current events to the app's large Gen Z audience. Its famed algorithm is known for serving trending content even if users do not follow certain people, allowing topics to quickly go viral among its 1 billion monthly users.  The app has become so influential in this conflict that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to "TikTokers" as a group that could help end the war, in a speech directed at Russian citizens. Some TikTokers picked up where the politician left off.  A Ukrainian travel blogger named Alina Volik, who has over 36,000 followers on TikTok, took a break from posting highlights of her trips to Egypt, Spain and Turkey, to upload videos of life in the invasion, of emergency backpacks filled with first aid supplies and of sealed windows to protect against glass shards in a blast. In TikTok videos posted on Monday, Volik also urged her international followers to watch her Instagram Stories to "see the truth" about Ukraine.  In an email to Reuters, Volik said she wanted to combat misinformation in the Russian news that the country's actions were a "military operation" rather than a war that is hurting Ukrainians.  Montages of residential buildings destroyed by missiles, empty grocery store shelves and long lines of cars piled up outside gas stations could be seen on the TikTok pages of top Ukrainian influencers.  "@zaluznik" who has 2 million followers, posted one such montage on Sunday with the caption "Russians open your eyes!"  Russian influencers have also taken to the app to share their reaction. Niki Proshin, who has over 763,000 TikTok followers, said in a video on Thursday that "normal people" in Russia do not support the war.  "None of my friends and none of the people I personally talk to supported today's events," he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine.  On Monday, Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor demanded the app stop including military-related content in recommended posts to minors, saying much of the content was anti-Russian in character. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. read more  Online misinformation researchers warned that false information about the conflict were now mixed in with authentic ones and has spread widely on TikTok and other tech platforms including Meta Platforms's (FB.O) Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube.  Footage of military simulator video game Arma 3, images of explosions from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza Strip, old footage of heavy firing and animations of flying aircraft have been shared on social media sites as if they depict the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.  "We continue to closely monitor the situation, with increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence," a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that it works with fact checking organizations.  Some Ukrainian TikTok users have made it a mission to share information and spread awareness with Western audiences.  "I want people to understand this is not a joke, this is a serious situation that Ukrainians face," Marta Vasyuta, 20, said in an interview on Monday.  One of Vasyuta's TikTok videos showed what appeared to be a missile in the sky with the caption "Kyiv 4:23 am." It had over 131,000 comments by Monday as users flooded the video to offer their prayers and express disbelief.  "Never thought I would get WAR updates on TIKTOK," commented one user.

No information was available about who was behind the attack at supplier Kojima Industries Corp nor the motive, but it came just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. It was unclear if the attack was related. read more  The cyberattack on Kojima exposed the fragility of smaller companies that may have less sophisticated technical systems, said Takamichi Saito, a professor and Director of the Cybersecurity Laboratory at Tokyo's Meiji University.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The big companies are pretty advanced with their measures, but a lot of their sub-companies and sub-sub companies aren't. Put that together with Japan's shift to manufacturing, and there just aren't enough technical people to keep up - and within companies, the IT sections don't have clout."  Cybersecurity has emerged as a key area of concern in Japan, where government critics say responses to hacking threats have been hampered by a fractured approach.  At smaller companies in particular, computer systems have been often adopted piecemeal by individual firms, and have taken longer to replace.  "Basically you can't get at any of the larger companies directly, so you aim for one of the suppliers at their edges, and attacks have been increasing lately," said Yoshihito Takata, a manager at cybersecurity provider BroadBand Security Inc (4398.T).  "These sorts of attacks don't just take place from 9 to 5 on weekdays, it's 24-hours a day, 365 days a year, from all around the world. So there's limits to what one company alone can do."  Toyota declined to comment on whether it had detected early signs of a potential cyberattack.  Smaller companies need to have a better grasp of what is needed for security, and that's where Japan most lags behind its overseas peers, said Toshio Nawa, senior analyst at the Cyber Defense Institute, a private cybersecurity firm.  "The larger companies and outside observers need to go in and give pinpoint advice on where they're vulnerable," he said.  Both guidance and financial support are needed from the central government, Nawa and others said. Some regions already provide this, but it needs to be more comprehensive.  "What Japan's furthest behind in is this situational awareness, due to a lot of thinking still left over from the past, companies sticking to what worked well before," Nawa said.

In a statement published by German newspaper Bild, Gisdol said he had been forced to take action having witnessed what is going on in Ukraine.  "I cannot pursue my calling in a country whose leader is responsible for a war of aggression in the middle of Europe," the 52-year-old said. "That is not in line with my values, which is why I have resigned from my position as coach with immediate effect.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I can't stand on the training ground in Moscow, train the players, demand professionalism and a few kilometres away orders are given that bring great suffering to an entire people. That is my personal decision and I am absolutely convinced of it."  His club, however, took to Twitter to say that Gisdol had been dismissed.  "Markus Gisdol was dismissed from the post of head coach of FC Lokomotiv. The club and the team are working as usual and are concentrating on achieving the maximum results in the upcoming matches," Lokomotiv said.  German coach Gisdol, who had previously spent his whole playing and coaching career in his homeland, most recently with Cologne, had been in charge for 12 matches.  The move came a day after FIFA and UEFA jointly suspended Russian teams from all international football, meaning Spartak Moscow, Russia's only side left in European competition, will no longer compete in the Europa League.  Lokomotiv were also in the Europa League but finished bottom of their group.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Peter Hall Editing by Christian Radnege

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov  LONDON, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe needs to wean itself off Russian gas. The Ukraine crisis has shown the folly of relying on Moscow for a large chunk of the continent’s 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) of annual supplies. Kicking the habit will take a concerted decade-long push.  Last year Russia piped about 150 bcm of gas to Europe. Shrinking that to zero over a decade means replacing 15 bcm a year. Yet Europe is also phasing out 100 bcm of coal-fired electricity on climate concerns, and its own production of gas is declining at 5 bcm a year. So Europe would need to make up an annual shortfall of 30 bcm, according to Bernstein analysts.  Renewable energy can fill some of the gap. If European countries keep building at the current rate, new wind and solar power projects will provide the equivalent of 11 bcm and 6.5 bcm, respectively. If the United States sends a third of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, up from 20% last year, that’s a further 6.8 bcm. Delaying the planned phase-out of existing nuclear power stations would replace 4.8 bcm of gas demand. Finally, investing in building insulation and installing 2 million new electric heat pumps instead of gas boilers every year would save a further 4 bcm.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  All this combined would provide 33 bcm of replacement power a year. But apart from cranking up wind and solar, which are already cheaper than fossil fuels, none of the other steps are straightforward. LNG suppliers ship to where prices are highest, and Europe’s facilities that turn the liquid fuel back into gas aren’t evenly distributed. Nuclear power is politically and environmentally contentious, and heat pumps require extensive subsidies.  To pull it off, Europe’s politicians will need help. Historically minded analysts wonder if the United States can reprise the spirit of the 1940s, when it provided funds to rebuild Europe and mobilised an airlift to Berlin. For a start, America could put pressure on Qatar, Australia and its own private companies to divert LNG cargoes to Europe. It could also help finance subsidies for heat pumps, or bolster Europe’s inadequate gas storage facilities.  Domestic consumers could help too. If 500 million Europeans took a cold shower and turned the heating off one day a month, they would reduce gas consumption by 4 bcm annually, Bernstein reckons. Shaking Europe’s addiction to Russian gas will require everyone to pitch in.

China relies on crude from the now pariah state for nearly a fifth of total imports. Though the pair can sidestep Western sanctions on Moscow and settle most transactions in yuan, being too helpful could backfire on Beijing. Its banks will be caught in the crossfire either way.  The two countries have been deepening economic ties for years. Russia counts the People’s Republic as its biggest trading partner; its central bank holds 13% of foreign reserves in yuan assets, up from 0.1% in 2015. At the same time, China, which ran a $12 billion trade deficit with its northern neighbor last year, bought $40 billion worth of Russian oil in 2021, or 16% of total crude imports. Just last month, the two inked a 30-year contract to supply Russian gas to China via a new pipeline.  Western sanctions on Russia, which include kicking out certain banks from the SWIFT international payment system and curbing Moscow’s access to a huge part of its foreign currency reserves, will push the two economies even closer, thanks in part to bilateral payment networks already in place. In 2017, Beijing established a foreign exchange system for simultaneously settling yuan and ruble transactions. China has also established its own answer to SWIFT, known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, to clear international claims in yuan. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In practice, though, usage of CIPS has been limited. State lenders like the $266 billion Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), (1398.HK), the world’s largest bank by assets and a major clearance bank for yuan trades in Russia, still heavily relies on SWIFT. Moreover, overtly assisting Moscow in undercutting sanctions could draw ire from the United States and allies. ICBC has stopped guaranteeing credit in dollar terms for bilateral trades with Russia, according to Bloomberg.  Beijing has options. Dedicating regional and smaller banks such as Hong Kong-listed Harbin Bank (6138.HK), based in the province bordering Russia, to specialise in bilateral trade might minimise risks for its larger banks that are more vulnerable to U.S. retaliation. But China’s balancing act is getting more precarious by the day.  Follow @ywchen1 on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

REUTERS/Scott Morgan/  NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Whether it’s “stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever”, Warren Buffett thinks it’s overpriced. In his company Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKa.N) annual investor letter published over the weekend, the Oracle of Omaha says interest rates have pushed the prices of investments up too far for comfort. So Buffett has been using his cash pile to buy Berkshire’s shares.  During the past two years, that has amounted to 9% of the total stock outstanding at the end of 2019, or almost $52 billion. Total returns on the $713 billion investment firm, which owns everything from railroads to Apple (AAPL.O) stock, have only narrowly beaten the S&P 500 Index over that period. But that’s a feat considering Buffett’s portfolio also includes old-school read more U.S. companies like Bank of America (BAC.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N).  He still has a cash position of about $144 billion, roughly half the size of U.S. oil giant Chevron’s (CVX.N) market capitalization. With the S&P 500 up almost 50% in two years, the purchasing power of that pile looks relatively smaller. That may be why Buffett notes “internal opportunities” deliver far better returns than acquisitions. In other words, more of the less-exciting same.

The central bank more than doubled its main policy interest rate to 20% on Monday to support the plunging rouble. It won’t be enough given Moscow has a dearth of palatable policy options.  The rouble fell as much as 23% against the dollar at the first chance traders had to react to some Russian banks’ imminent ejection from the SWIFT payments system as well as restrictions on central bank reserves. Those Western sanctions shattered the impression that Moscow had large enough economic buffers to withstand whatever America and its Western allies might throw its way.  Those defences had been built up since 2014, when President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea. Russia runs a budget surplus and has total external debt of only around $478 billion, or about a third of GDP. It had amassed more than $630 billion in central bank reserves read more and around $174 billion in the National Wealth Fund that grows when energy prices rise. Lenders like Sberbank (SBER.MM) were well capitalised and not reliant on foreign funding.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  All that went out the window over the weekend. Sanctions make it less certain that large revenues from energy exports will keep rolling in. The central bank’s massive rate rise was of temporary help but won’t be enough to stop Russians from trying to convert their savings into foreign exchange or withdraw money out of banks altogether. That’s why Sberbank’s global depository receipt lost more than two-thirds of its value in London trading, even as the Moscow market was shut. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, said Sberbank’s subsidiaries in Austria, Croatia and Slovenia were likely to fail.  Central bank boss Elvira Nabiullina said Russia’s internal payments system can connect to international alternatives to SWIFT. Maybe, but that won’t make overseas counterparties any less rouble-averse. She could hike rates a lot higher, but that would hurt a damaged economy. Ramping up capital controls is another option. She has already ordered any attempt by foreigners to sell Russian securities to be rejected. But banning rouble sales outright would paralyse importers. The central bank sold $1 billion propping up the rouble on Thursday but will find it harder to keep going following fresh sanctions which also hit the wealth fund.  Nabiullina’s best efforts won’t prevent the rouble’s collapse from reverberating throughout the economy. For all her past policy successes, it’s not in her power to prevent an economic collapse.

Whether it is the move away from an economic system reliant upon hydrocarbons, vanquishing the Covid-19 plague or central banks ending the free-money era, extraordinary shifts are occurring across the planet that will shape markets, corporate finance, politics and economies well beyond the coming year. These are the themes that inform Reuters Breakingviews’ annual book of predictions and prescriptions: “A World in Transition”.  Read PDF  Read online (for mobile)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The extraordinary actions required to drive these epochal trends are being taken now, even if it will be years or even decades before achievements can be meaningfully measured. Inevitable transitions, like the one toward renewable energy, are better embraced than resisted. Investors and entrepreneurs who can adapt to change and its concomitant upheaval will reap the greatest rewards. But they must be prepared to make sacrifices along the way. Without social inclusion, these transformations may lead to violence.  Efforts by governments and companies to reduce carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050 or sooner to limit planetary frying to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will continue to dominate the financial and business landscape in 2022. Switching away from coal, gas and oil is a priority. But every sector, including heavy industries like steel and cement, transportation, agriculture and banking, will soon need to make huge commitments to meet the lofty ambitions of the next generation. Our columnists explore all of these.  At the same time, inflation is less quiescent than in the past couple of decades. Central banks will have to start pulling away the punchbowl, which has broad implications for the cost of capital (it goes up!) and the price of money. Speaking of which, money itself will go through a transformational period as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities try to keep up with the emerging dynamics of crypto and digital currencies.  A third year of the pandemic, with the persistent threat of new, more virulent strains, continues to dramatically accelerate the shift to digital-everything. The winners and losers of this transition will become more evident in 2022. Quasi-monopolies - like Amazon.com in delivery and web-services; Meta (FB.O), the company formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in advertising; and Microsoft (MSFT.O) in workflow – were given extraordinary boosts by state-mandated shutdowns. Governments face a make-or-break year to regulate these multi-trillion-dollar behemoths. Microsoft under Satya Nadella is our pick to manage these headwinds best.  And even as people trickle back to offices, post-pandemic dynamics in communications, training, travel and social interaction are permanently reshaping the workplace and productivity. This has implications for the nature of labour, property, urban planning and beyond. It also poses new challenges to leaders, none of whom were trained at Harvard Business School or INSEAD to run sprawling organisations of employees working individually from home. That’s why we’re predicting predicting high CEO turnover, robot investment bankers and a return to offshore jobs.  The increasingly chilly war between the United States and China will dominate international trade and geopolitics. The kerfuffle over U.S. nuclear-submarine sales to Australia and America’s shambolic retreat from Afghanistan offered glimpses into the fractious nature of the Western alliance. With Xi Jinping set for a third term (if not life) as China’s president, U.S. President Joe Biden has a chance to reach détente of some sort to cooperate on climate change, the pandemic and other priorities. But with Biden’s own party facing a trouncing in November's congressional elections, his hands may be tied. On the plus side, European leadership will have a chance to consolidate as French President Emmanuel Macron likely wins a second term in May, Germany welcomes a new chancellor after 16 years with Angela Merkel at the helm, and Italy chooses its next president.  Success will require extraordinary social inclusion. Governments, companies and taxpayers (especially the richest) have to proactively prepare for the sacrifices that are needed to prevent the earth from scorching, while delivering greater equity, financial inclusion and social justice. Failure to do so will lead to civil unrest or worse. In addition to being terrible for business, that would torpedo more existential goals like limiting global warming, whose deleterious effects will be disproportionately borne by the world’s poor. Here’s hoping the business world and financial markets help guide the way to a fairer, greener and more just society in the year ahead.

Buckling under domestic and international pressure, the government on Monday agreed to adopt European Union financial sanctions read more on Russia. It’s a departure from Bern’s tradition of playing the neutral middleman. In 2014, the world’s biggest offshore financial centre refused to adopt the penalties Brussels imposed on Moscow for annexing Crimea. Instead Switzerland limited itself to ensuring it would not become a route to bypass Western sanctions.  Switzerland’s new stance affects its safe-haven status. The country’s banks had about $11 billion from Russian residents in September, according to the Bank for International Settlements, but that figure does not include precious assets or real estate and excludes cash held by Russians living abroad. Rich Russians can count on some $500 billion of investible wealth, says the Boston Consulting Group, half of which is probably stashed outside the country.  The decision will resonate beyond Russia. The country’s political stability and unwillingness to take sides in international disputes has attracted rich investors as well as criminals and corrupt politicians to its banks, which hold $2.4 trillion of foreign financial wealth. Plutocrats now know which side of the fence Switzerland is on.

REUTERS/Amir Cohen  LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe’s defence companies are headed for a prolonged boost. On Sunday, Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised to ramp up spending on tanks, drones and soldiers to 100 billion euros this year, and ratchet up its defence budget to beyond the 2% of economic output expected by NATO countries. Shares in Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI) were up 14%, while Germany’s Rheinmetall and Hensoldt (HAGG.DE) rose 33% and 46%, respectively.  They could be in for another bump. Closing NATO’s funding gap would cost around 62 billion pounds per year, Jefferies analysts reckon. Germany’s news added 3 billion pounds to BAE’s 20.5 billion pound enterprise value. That implies BAE could gain around 3% of this extra revenue, according to a Breakingviews calculation that assumes the group’s current 13% EBITDA margin and a 2023 multiple of 9 times. However, Russia’s recent actions are likely to push other countries, like the United States and Britain, to ramp up their defence spending to far beyond 2%. Hence the potential pot of defence funds could exceed the market’s current expectations.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors in Russia are facing a mark-to-no-market problem. The rouble tanked and the country’s stock exchange did not open after the West cranked up sanctions against President Vladimir Putin. Even when trading resumes, foreign money managers and companies face the prospect of writing off their investments in the country, as oil giant BP did.  Investors in Russian securities face two big questions after the United States and allies restricted the country’s foreign exchange reserves and promised to kick some banks out of the SWIFT global payments system. The first is whether investors will be able to sell. Russia’s equity and derivatives markets remained closed Monday, while the central bank ordered brokers not to execute sell orders from foreign shareholders read more .  The second question is whether they’ll be able to get their money out. Russian authorities are scrambling to preserve foreign currency reserves, while banks are navigating a thicket of rapidly changing sanctions when processing international payments. It’s far from clear what investors like Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which said it was selling its $2.8 billion portfolio of Russian securities read more , will get back.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Western companies with big businesses in Russia face similar challenges. The European Central Bank said Russian lender Sberbank’s (SBER.MM) subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia were “likely to fail”. It’s not hard to imagine the Russian central bank taking similar aim at local subsidiaries of European lenders like Raiffeisen Bank (RBIV.VI) or Société Générale (SOGN.PA) read more . A rapid exit is costly, as BP demonstrated when announcing it would offload its 20% stake in Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM). Faced with a dearth of obvious buyers, the company may end up writing off its entire $25 billion investment read more .  Global financial markets should be able to cope with some turmoil in Moscow. According to Morningstar, Russian equities accounted for less than 0.3% of the 12 trillion euros invested in long-term European funds at the end of January. However, the consequences of disrupting flows of capital and credit with a $1.4 trillion economy will take longer to become clear. In 1998, more than a month passed between Russia defaulting on its sovereign debt and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, necessitating a bailout by Wall Street banks. Given the broader geopolitical uncertainty, Russia’s mark-to-no-market problem looks set to ricochet around the world for weeks to come.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo - S1BEUDNDFKAA  LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bernard Looney is removing an increasingly awkward appendage. In a seismic move, the BP chief executive said on Sunday the UK oil giant would exit its 19.75% stake in Rosneft (ROSN.MM), the state-controlled Russian energy major read more . In financial terms the timing couldn’t be worse. But Looney may still get something of a consolation.  BP’s relationship with Rosneft has been a mixed blessing ever since the British company’s TNK-BP joint venture unravelled in 2013, leaving the British company with a $12 billion pile of cash and its equity stake. Owning a fifth of one of the world’s largest oil companies allowed BP to last year add 1.1 million barrels of crude oil a day to its output of 2.2 million and $2.7 billion of profit before interest and tax. Yet Rosneft’s proximity to the government made some investors increasingly edgy. President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine made BP’s position untenable.  Getting out now is financially painful, though. BP valued its Rosneft shares at $14 billion at the end of last year. Their market value on Friday was almost half that amount. Given the obvious lack of buyers, Looney may have to write off the entire amount. Throw in another $11 billion hit from foreign exchange losses that BP previously only reflected on its balance sheet, and Looney could this year face a $25 billion charge to his bottom line.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  While writing off the investment won’t cost BP any cash, the hit to its balance sheet means net debt rises from 25% of total capital at the end of last year to as much as 28%, according to Breakingviews calculations. Looney also loses $2 billion from the $40 billion of EBITDA he expects by 2025 to help finance the group’s investments in renewable energy.  BP could have avoided that mess by exiting earlier. It is hardly alone, though. French rival TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) faces a similar conundrum over its 19% equity stake in $46 billion gas group Novatek (NVTK.MM), while Shell and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) have big interests in Russia. BP is rid of an asset that presented an increasing headache on environmental, social and governance grounds. In time, shareholders may even reward its remaining earnings with a higher multiple. Without the crisis in Ukraine, it’s a decision BP may not have made at all.

LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The West is deploying the financial equivalent of “shock and awe” tactics against Russia. The United States and its allies on Saturday read more said they will limit Moscow’s ability to use a large chunk of its foreign-currency reserves and kick some of the country’s banks out of the SWIFT payment system in what looks like a deliberate attempt to undermine confidence in Russia’s financial system read more . The consequences will be felt around the world.  The statement from the United States, Germany, France, Italy and others marked an escalation of the financial assault against Russian President Vladimir Putin. The importance of the promise to exclude some as-yet-unnamed Russian banks from SWIFT, which manages the messaging system used for international payments, depends on which financial institutions are targeted. The United States and others have already frozen the assets of lenders like state-controlled VTB (VTBR.MM) and banned them from dealing with local banks. Switching to another communications system is a minor inconvenience by comparison. Meanwhile Gazprombank, which facilitates much of the country’s energy exports, has so far escaped the severest sanctions.  Going after Russia’s foreign-currency reserves has bigger consequences. The central bank’s $630 billion stash is vital to financing imports and defending the rouble in a prolonged standoff with the West over Ukraine. Though Russia has shifted reserves into the Chinese yuan and gold, about 45% of its assets were still in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan at the end of 2020, according to central bank data. If those were frozen, Putin’s ability to protect the economy would be diminished.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It’s unclear how the West intends to restrict Russia’s reserves. Central bank assets deposited in other countries generally enjoy sovereign immunity. There have been some exceptions: The U.S. Congress in 2012 gave Americans the right to go after $1.75 billion belonging to Iran’s central bank. And the United States froze $7 billion of Afghanistan bank reserves after the country fell to the Taliban last year. But a coordinated attack on a large country’s overseas assets is unprecedented.  Russia’s central bank said on Sunday banks had sufficient capital and liquidity to function smoothly. However, Reuters reported there were long queues at cash machines. It’s far from certain that the latest sanctions will persuade Putin to change course. But they will doubtless prompt China to further examine its exposure to the U.S.-led financial system. The repercussions of the Western assault will reverberate for many years.  Follow @peter_tl on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Financial penalties didn’t deter Russia’s read more Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine. They may have even less chance of preventing that other global act of aggression the United States would rather avoid: China trying to take control of Taiwan, the self-governing island it claims as part of its territory. If anything, past sanctions have served to balkanize the world further.  The idea behind sanctions read more like those U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday is to impose a cost on the aggressor – in this case, depriving big banks of access to American financial markets, and curbing access to technology. But unless structured carefully, they can impose a cost on the originator too. Russia is the third-largest oil producer in the world, and heats much of Europe through winter. That’s why so far, the West read more has spared the country’s energy sector, and declined to eject it from the SWIFT system used by banks for cross-border payments.  If China did move on Taiwan, it would make the challenges of structuring Russia-Ukraine sanctions look like a cakewalk. The United States has a vague duty to help the island defend itself according to the Taiwan Relations Act. But the number of carve-outs that would be required given huge bilateral U.S.-China trade could impair their effectiveness. China was the top source of foreign imports in America last year, accounting for almost 20% of such goods. Companies from Starbucks (SBUX.O) to Apple (AAPL.O) to JPMorgan (JPM.N) and BlackRock (BLK.N) have significant interests and aspirations in the country. Targeting China’s biggest banks could also harm the global economy. It’s home to four globally systemically important banks, according to the Financial Stability Board’s 2021 list.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Moreover, China has a head start in creating workarounds. The country has its own SWIFT rival known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System. Washington’s earlier restrictions on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei were effective, but that also caused Chinese companies to accelerate development of their own microchips and mobile operating systems, reducing their reliance on American versions.  Biden said on Thursday that Russian sanctions weren’t mean to prevent hostilities, but rather to inflict economic pain over time. If China were the aggressor, the preventative power of sanctions would be even weaker. Even if that scenario remains far away, the international economic system America helped build is showing ever more cracks.

MILAN, Feb 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Western executives watched with horror as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine on Thursday. Bank bosses like Frédéric Oudéa of Société Générale (SOGN.PA) and UniCredit’s (CRDI.MI) Andrea Orcel have more to fear than most. The 8% fall in the STOXX Euro 600 Banks Index on Thursday and a 3% decline in share prices of American lenders like JPMorgan (JPM.N) reflects a triple whammy of risks.  The selloff is partly down to a gloomier economic outlook. A protracted conflict could push up energy and food prices, dampen consumer confidence and slow the pace of central-bank rate hikes. Money market prices suggest investors now think the U.S. Federal Reserve is less likely to raise policy rates by 50 basis points in March read more . Delays would postpone a much-anticipated windfall for Western banks, whose lending margins improve with higher interest rates read more .  Sanctions present a further problem. Banks in Italy, France and Austria hold $68 billion of combined exposure to Russia as of September 2021, almost five times the total for American lenders, Bank for International Settlements data shows.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Much of that is cross-border lending to large Russian companies. If domestic economic pain mounts or the value of the rouble collapses, Russian borrowers could struggle to repay loans. Excluding Russia from the SWIFT banking network might make it harder for banks like UniCredit and SocGen to collect interest payments. The French group had 3 billion euros of exposure to larger Russian companies at the end of 2020, European Banking Authority data shows, while its Italian rival has about 5 billion euros of cross-border Russian loans. Lenders are already increasing their provisions against potential defaults, one senior banker told Reuters Breakingviews.  A final risk affects Western banks’ Russian subsidiaries. Raiffeisen’s (RBIV.VI) local unit, for example, brought in one-third of its parent’s earnings last year. Those businesses would face heavy losses if the economy tanks. There’s also a danger that Russian authorities respond to Western sanctions on lenders like Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM) by seizing foreign-owned banks at home. In a worst-case scenario, where lenders had to write off the equity in their Russian subsidiaries, Raiffeisen’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio would fall by 1 percentage point, JPMorgan analysts calculate. The equivalent hit for UniCredit would be at most 40 basis points. Such scenarios are distant right now. But it’s clearly enough to keep investors on their toes.

LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Swiss Re (SRENH.S) on Friday provided an insight into the cost of America’s Covid-19 tragedy. The $30 billion company reported a $2 billion pre-tax profit hit from life insurance policies for working-age people, who died in greater numbers than expected due to the pandemic. Net income was just $1.4 billion last year, well below the $1.9 billion expected by analysts. Chief Executive Christian Mumenthaler also kept the Swiss company’s dividend flat; in contrast to rival Munich Re which on Wednesday raised its payout and launched a share buyback. Swiss Re shares fell as much as 7% on Friday morning.  Mumenthaler reckons the company’s life and health business will deliver $300 million of net income this year, around half of what analysts had pencilled in. He plans to expand further in reinsuring against natural catastrophes. That’s a gamble: natural disaster insurance losses hit $130 billion globally last year, 76% above the average this century, according to insurance broker Aon.

Such illicit departures have now become so common, state media report, that officials are offering $16,000 rewards for tips on illegal border crossings. The former British colony, long a haven for Chinese people escaping political and economic chaos, is fast losing its allure.  As Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s administration jails opponents and fumbles its pandemic response, news outlets have focused on distress radiating out of the Western expatriate community. Their loss, the argument goes, would make the city less “international”.  Perhaps, but Hong Kong’s internationalism is vastly exaggerated.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The 2016 census showed the city had fewer than 60,000 Caucasian residents, 0.8% of the total. Ethnically Chinese people make up 92% of the 7.4 million population. Same goes for the stock market: 98% of the Hang Seng Composite Index constituents are Chinese. The smattering of loud white people gabbing at pubs in the financial district might look cosmopolitan to locals, but by contrast there are nearly 900,000 Chinese living in the New York metro area.  Mainland migrants, on the other hand, are more numerous and more important to Hong Kong’s future. They share nationality with locals but must get visas to relocate, just like foreigners. Official data shows an average of around 40,000 of them moved to the city every year between 2010 and 2019 under the “one-way permit” scheme; another 11,000 or so per year come via a visa programme for skilled mainland professionals, and then there are college students. Those who stay seven years can switch to a Hong Kong passport, at which point they statistically blend with locals.  This community plays a crucial role intermediating between the city and the $15 trillion Goliath next door. Native Mandarin-speakers help banks, luxury brands and manufacturers understand and do business in the People’s Republic. The stock exchange’s charismatic former Chief Executive Charles Li, who linked equity and bond trading between Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses – a game-changing reform – is a migrant from northern China. Every year mainland-headquartered banks take over one-third of the fees generated by equity issues on the local bourse, Dealogic data show. The trade and investment flowing through the city focuses almost entirely on the market to the north.  LOSING PATIENCE  Now that the seven-day average case rate has crossed 8,000 daily new cases, an all-time peak, decades of underinvestment in public healthcare – aggravated by decades of reluctance to import mainland-trained medical staff – are becoming brutally clear. Like the Westerners, the mainlander community is now full of stories of people sending children back home or evacuating outright.  Patients were forced to wait outside overflowing public hospitals in the middle of a winter monsoon; adding insult to injury, mainlanders who went to government medical centres often complain that doctors and nurses are unwilling, or unable, to speak clear Mandarin. During a recent visit, a local doctor confessed she was unable to translate a diagnosis from English into Chinese because she didn’t know the characters for the patient’s condition.  Official projections suggest the financial hub needs average net inflows of over 40,000 people per year through 2069 to offset the accelerating contraction of its population. From the end of 2019 to the middle of 2021 the city lost 123,000 people. Since the contagion rate blew up in mid-February, net departures via the airport and land border have averaged over 3,000 per day.  The 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations contained a localist faction that openly resented Mandarin-speakers, so some mainland immigrants do cheer the government’s hard line. President Xi Jinping’s interest in the city may be limited to ensuring it doesn’t revolt, but individuals move here for opportunity, quality of life, and even political freedom. Yet for all Lam’s performative acts of loyalty, she has made little progress resolving long-standing economic issues that make Hong Kong one of the most unequal societies in the world. read more  Like everyone else, mainlanders who move to Hong Kong get gouged by elite family monopolies, overpaying for rent, education and groceries. The slow pace of digitisation and innovation is baffling to those accustomed to China’s cashless, app-driven lifestyle. The average Hong Konger may be four times wealthier than the average mainlander in terms of gross national income. But China’s best and brightest, trained in the West and multilingual, no longer need a stint in Hong Kong for international gloss. Indeed mainlanders seeking multinational experience need not leave China; VF Group, parent company of Vans and Northface, relocated its Asian operations centre from Hong Kong to Shanghai in 2021, and other global companies and financial institutions are conducting similar migrations. Pay gaps are shrinking while the city’s stratospheric cost of living erodes its income tax advantage. Lam herself is encouraging young Hong Kongers to move north to work.  Some locals accuse mainlanders of driving up property prices, of being uncouth, brainwashed or worse. Be that as it may, the city’s future depends on them. Hong Kong can afford to lose the Western expatriates. It’s the Chinese people officials have to reassure.

Sputnik/Aleksey Nikolskyi/Kremlin via REUTERS  WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Russia is getting an uber taste of what it’s like to be Huawei. The U.S. government said on Thursday it will cut the country off from American microchips, telecoms gear and other items. It’s a more wide-ranging version of the trade curbs that hobbled China’s telecommunications giant and could sting the Russian economy more than financial sanctions.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine read more has provoked sweeping penalties from Washington and its allies. The country’s biggest financial firm, Sberbank (SBER.MM), can no longer use U.S. counterparts to transfer money. Another bank, VTB (VTBR.MM), faces harsher sanctions that include freezing U.S. assets.  Extensive export controls may prove even more troubling for Russian President Vladimir Putin. American businesses that sell certain products to Russian entities are now effectively banned from doing so unless they obtain licenses, which will mostly be denied. Those items include computers, information security gear, lasers and sensors. The curbs are designed to include foreign goods produced using U.S. equipment, software and blueprints. The U.S. Commerce Department said it is the most comprehensive application of restrictions targeting a single nation.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Huawei's experience shows the pain these limits can cause. Citing national security concerns, Washington campaigned to turn the group into an international pariah. Isolated from American suppliers, though not blocked as thoroughly elsewhere as the Ukraine-related sanctions may achieve, the company said in December it expected a nearly 30% drop in revenue in 2021 compared to the previous year.  Putin needs sophisticated semiconductors for the government-controlled internet he wants to build. And Russia's burgeoning technology sector could suffer, including New York-listed Yandex (YNDX.O), which started life as a search engine and expanded to food delivery, shopping, taxis and other services, or e-commerce group Ozon (OZON.O) which listed in New York in 2020. Russians might also find their president's war less palatable if, among other hardships, they find it’s more difficult to buy the smartphones they want.  For the West, export restrictions have the benefit of spurring less economic blowback than the harshest financial sanctions might produce for banks, investors and the energy sector. The impact for Russia could be like Huawei, but on steroids. Whether even that's enough to deter Putin is another question.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

The movie, which Apple TV+ acquired at the Sundance Film Festival for $25 million, follows the story of a small-town girl who pursues her dream of becoming a singer. The film, directed by Sian Heder, cast deaf actors Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as parents of the young performer, played by Emilia Jones. Kotsur also won the award for male actor in a supporting role.  "We deaf actors have come a long way," said Matlin, speaking through an interpreter.

Several major films are slated for global release, "The Batman," scheduled to open in Russia on March 3 as part of a worldwide roll-out, and Paramount Pictures' "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" which makes its global debut on April 8.  WarnerMedia said it would continue to monitor the situation as it awaits "a swift and peaceful resolution to this tragedy.”  One Hollywood trade publication reported studio executives are wrestling with the Russia question, as the U.S. and its European allies enact economic sanctions.  "If the U.S. and its allies want to cut off Russia from the rest of the world, then how would we go ahead and release our movies there?" one studio executive told The Hollywood Reporter.

Gergiev - general director of the St. Petersburg Mariinsky Theatre and regarded as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin - conducted "The Queen of Spades", an opera based on Alexander Pushkin's novel, at La Scala on Feb. 23.  The show will run ‪until March 15 and the next performance is scheduled for Saturday.

"The maestro did not reply to us," he added, referring to requests for Gergiev to comment on the Ukraine crisis.  The Mariinsky Theatre did not respond to a request for comment.  The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra also said it was suspending its work with Gergiev, who is an honorary conductor in the Dutch city, and would cancel a Gergiev Festival planned for September unless he distances himself from Putin's actions.  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter last week gave Gergiev a deadline of Monday to speak out or be removed as principal conductor of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.  The Moscow-born Gergiev, 68, has performed in the most famous theatres around the world. In 2013, Putin awarded him the first title of Hero of Labour of Russia.  But those ties have rebounded on him as Western nations react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest assault on a European nation since World War Two.  Gergiev had been due to conduct three concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall leading the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra from Feb. 25-27.  But the Russian conductor has been replaced by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, according to the theatre's website.  Separately, the Venice La Biennale art exhibition said the curator and artists of the Pavilion of the Russian Federation had pulled out of the event in protest at the war in Ukraine.  "La Biennale expresses its complete solidarity for this noble act of courage," it said in a statement.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon  TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Sega Sammy Holdings Inc (6460.T) is hoping to ride the fast-moving coattails of Sonic the Hedgehog as the character enjoys a renaissance amid a global scramble for entertainment content.  This year sees the release of a sequel to a record-breaking Hollywood movie and a Netflix series, along with a title that Sega hopes will revive the fortunes of the long-running Sonic game franchise after decades of malaise.  "Sonic is the face of Sega. If Sonic is doing well, then Sega is doing well to an extent, too," Shuji Utsumi, co-chief operation officer of Sega, told Reuters in an interview.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The blue blur became a household name in the West in a series of side-scrolling games in the 1990s on the Sega Mega Drive console, also known as the Sega Genesis in North America, which outsold Nintendo's Super NES in many countries.  "Sonic was cool with humour and an attitude... that resonated in the West," said Utsumi, who worked at Sony when it launched the first PlayStation.  Unlike Nintendo's Mario, who starred in decades of acclaimed titles, Sonic struggled to make the transition to 3D games as Sega withdrew from the console business to become a game publisher.  Now, after years of trial and error during which Sega merged with pachinko gambling machine maker Sammy, Sonic revived his career as a movie star as studios raided corporate larders for underused characters with mass appeal.  Sonic-related sales, including from the movie, have quadrupled in the five years to the financial year that ended March 2021.  The game series has a committed, and long-suffering, fanbase in the West, in contrast with other Sega franchises such as "Yakuza" and "Persona", which have a large audience in Japan.  "It's definitely a nostalgic love for him," said Jacob Mills, 31, a British game level designer, referring to the hedgehog. Mills plays new Sonic releases and describes his enthusiasm as "a shared experience of mutual disappointment."  Initial prospects for the first Sonic movie from Paramount, which featured Jim Carrey, seemed in doubt when a trailer showing the character with prominent white teeth was derided on social media.  The studio tweaked the design, and the movie eventually raked in more than $300 million worldwide - becoming one of the best grossing video game adaptations - after its release in 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.  "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" will be released in April. The franchise's importance to Paramount was underscored in an investor presentation earlier this month outlining the future of the company and announcing a second Sonic sequel along with a hybrid animated/live-action series about the Knuckles character for its streaming service. A separate animated series is due to launch on Netflix this year.  "It's another big franchise for us and for Sega," Paramount Pictures chief Brian Robbins told Reuters. The Sonic investment is part of a broader commitment to franchises spanning movies and series, Paramount Chief Executive Bob Bakish said during the presentation. Shares fell on scepticism over whether the content could compete in an increasingly crowded streaming market.  OPEN WORLD  Sega has embraced the Sonic community, in 2017 releasing Sonic Mania, a widely praised retro platformer that began life as a fan-made game before being backed by firm.  An artist from the game later worked for Paramount on the Sonic movie, and Sega interacts humorously with fans on via the Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which has 5.8 million followers.  Expectations are growing for "Sonic Frontiers", an open world platformer due for release this year. The format is novel for the franchise, whose other games have been bought or downloaded 1.38 billion times.  Sega has not shown any gameplay for the title, which was delayed for a year, and wary fans point to the "Sonic cycle", in which excitement and talk of a comeback in the build-up to a new release is dashed by disappointment on playing the game.  The earnings impact of Sonic-related output "is going to be tangible" in the financial year starting in April, Utsumi said, without providing further details.  This month, the company upgraded its full year operating profit forecast by a third to 31 billion yen ($268 million). The gaming unit has been boosted by sales of titles such as role-playing game "Shin Megami Tensei V" for the Nintendo Switch.  Utsumi, who returned to Sega two years ago after founding his own gaming company and working at Disney and Warner Music, says the company is a "treasure island" of content that could be further commercialized.  Other Japanese characters joining the rush include a forthcoming Super Mario movie from "Minions" studio Illumination and Netflix's live action remake of cult 1990s anime Cowboy BeBop released last year.  Sega has a close relationship with Xbox maker Microsoft and in November said it was exploring an alliance to develop titles using the Redmond, Washington-based firm's cloud technology.  Longer term, Sega aims to create a "super game" with global appeal - that perhaps will be part of the "metaverse", a buzzy term for a network of persistent simulated online environments.  Sega, whose shares have rise by 16% year-to-date, has long experience across arcade and console gaming and different genres, Utsumi said.  "There's no one better suited to do this than us," he said.

The 25-year-old actor has been all-but-singlehandedly propelling ticket sales at North American movie theaters, leading two films in the top three spots on domestic box office charts. Over the weekend, his action-adventure "Uncharted" repeated No. 1 as his comic book epic "Spider-Man: No Way Home" followed closely behind in third place.  "Uncharted," Sony's long-in-the-works video game adaptation, brought in $23.2 million from 4,275 domestic venues in its second weekend of release, representing a 46% decline in revenues from its opening. That brings its domestic total to $83.3 million. A drop around 50% is standard for big-budget tentpoles, but making its hold a little more impressive, the film did not enjoy the rapturous reviews that greeted "Spider-Man: No Way Home." It helps that "Uncharted" is based on an extremely popular video game series and caters to younger males, a demographic that has been reliably going to the movies during COVID-19.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Meanwhile, another Sony blockbuster "Spider-Man: No Way Home" took the No. 3 spot with $5.7 million from 3,002 North American theaters, sliding only 23% in its 11th weekend in theaters. Since debuting on the big screen in December, the Spidey threequel has managed to stay in the top three on domestic box office charts -- a rare feat with or without an industry-altering pandemic. Through Sunday, "No Way Home" has collected an enormous $779.8 million in total. Given the movie's stellar week-to-week holds, "Spider-Man" could soon become the third movie ever to cross $800 million at the domestic box office.  In second place, Channing Tatum's PG-13 canine adventure "Dog" had surprisingly solid attendance levels in its sophomore outing. The road-trip buddy comedy, from MGM, earned $10.1 million from 3,827 screens over the weekend, pushing its North American tally to $30.8 million. It's a strong result for a movie that carries a $15 million production budget. The movie, which was smartly marketed with the tagline "Don't worry, the dog doesn't die" in an attempt to win over anyone still reeling from the 2008 tear-jerker "Marley and Me," continues to perform in America's heartland. Midwestern and small-town cities have been leading ticket sales over west and east coast cities and other major domestic markets.  Two new releases, "Studio 666" and "Cyrano," failed to make a notable dent on box office charts.  "Studio 666," a horror-comedy-musical-fantasy about Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and his bandmates as they attempt to record their 10th studio album, landed in eighth place with $1.5 million from 2,306 North American theaters. The R-rated film got mixed reviews, though several film critics admitted "Studio 666" is at least fun to watch. Associated Press critic Jake Coyle liked the film to "a decent SNL sketch stretched to nearly two hours" and the New York Times critic at large Wesley Morris aptly described the movie as exuding "real 'Scooby-Doo'-meets-'The Shining' vibes."  David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, called "Studio 666" an original oddity, one that was built around Dave Grohl's and the Foo Fighters band's popularity. "This is a weak opening, he said, noting "there aren't many horror comedies in general" at the box office.  "Cyrano," a romantic musical drama directed by Joe Wright and starring "Game of Thrones" actor Peter Dinklage, nabbed the No. 9 spot. The well-reviewed film, based on the 2018 stage musical and Edmond Rostand's 1987 play "Cyrano de Bergerac" about an emotionally crushing love triangle, opened in just 797 locations and grossed $1.4 million. Nearly 60% of opening weekend audience members were female, according to exit polls. MGM will continue to expand the movie's theatrical footprint in the coming weeks, but given its $30 million production budget, the profit margins for "Cyrano" could be more brutal than heartbreak.

Pictures released by Ukraine's presidential press service on Thursday showed the Oscar winner attending a media briefing at the presidential office in Kyiv as Russian military invaded the country.  "The director specially came to Kyiv to record all the events that are currently happening in Ukraine and to tell the world the truth about Russia's invasion of our country," the presidential office said in a translated statement on its Facebook page.

Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty."  It said Penn - who has become a high profile campaigner on humanitarian and political issues - had spoken to Ukrainian political and military figures as well as journalists.  Penn previously travelled to Ukraine in November, meeting the military in preparation for the documentary, the statement added.  "Sean Penn demonstrates the courage that many others, especially Western politicians lack," it said.  "The more such people, true friends of Ukraine, who support the fight for freedom, the sooner it will be possible to stop the massive attack on Russia."  Industry publication Variety said Penn's documentary was for Vice Studios, in association with Vice World News and Endeavor Content.

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw  COPENHAGEN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Russia will not be allowed to participate in the final of this year's Eurovision song contest, the organiser said on Friday, after Ukraine and several other European public broadcasters had called for Russia to be expelled.  "The decision reflects concern that, in the light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year's contest would bring the competition into disrepute," the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said in a statement.  Finland said on Friday it would not send contestants to the final if Russia was allowed to participate. Public broadcasters in Ukraine, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Norway had all urged the EBU to expel Russia.

The chairman of Ukraine's public broadcasting company Suspilne, Mykola Chernotytsky, wrote to the EBU saying that "Russia's participation, as an aggressor and violator of international law, in this year's Eurovision undermines the very idea of the competition".  He said Russia's state broadcaster was a "leading element of the Russian government's information war against Ukraine".  Russia was one of the favourites for the competition in 2016, when Crimean Tatar Susana Jamaladinova of Ukraine, known as Jamala, unexpectedly won with a song about Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's deportation of hundreds of thousands of people from her Black Sea homeland, two years after Russia annexed the territory.  The following year, as host of the finals, Ukraine barred Russia's entry from entering.

President Biden will give his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, marking the most consequential speech of his lifetime as U.S. inflation soars and Eastern Europe devolves into war.  While State of the Union speeches tend to concentrate on domestic issues, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine despite Biden’s repeated threats of economic sanctions has brought the U.S. president’s foreign policy agenda into central focus.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Post-Cold War order on verge of collapse  Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert Sunday after the U.S. and other Western nations announced that they would remove selected Russian banks from the SWIFT international financial messaging system. It’s the latest measure taken against Russia after initial economic sanctions failed to deter Putin from invading Ukraine as the Biden administration had hoped.  During his speech Tuesday, the president is expected to champion the sanctions and his own efforts in building a "global coalition to fight against the autocracy" of the Kremlin, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday.  "If you look back when President [Barack] Obama gave his first State of the Union, it was during the worst financial crisis in a generation," Psaki said. "When President [George W.] Bush gave his first State of the Union, it was shortly after 9/11. Leaders lead during crises. That’s exactly what President Biden is doing."  Republican lawmakers mused at the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference that the speech likely had to be rewritten.  "I think they've probably torn up the draft they had for the State of the Union and are realizing that issues are getting away from them," Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital at CPAC.  GOP LAWMAKERS PREDICT WHAT'S IN BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS: ‘PROBABLY TORN UP THE DRAFT THEY HAD’  "And that they're going to need to buckle down and do some hard work on these foreign policy issues. We've got a lot of countries now that are very upset with the U.S. because we've appeared weak and indecisive about how we were going to move forward against aggressors."  Dr. James Anderson, the former deputy undersecretary for policy at the Department of Defense, told Fox News Digital on Monday that Biden should use his speech to lay out "additional measures" to be taken against Russia, such as expelling more diplomats and banning Aeroflot flights from entering U.S. airspace.  Putin will be "looking closely at what President Biden says," Anderson said.  Rising inflation, sinking approval ratings  The economy is also a key issue for Biden’s State of the Union address as inflation reaches a 40-year high and gasoline prices hit their highest level in eight years. Biden has warned that his sanctions against Russia could drive up gas prices even more, which could further impact his approval ratings, where the overwhelming majority of voters say skyrocketing grocery and energy prices are causing them financial hardship, according to a new Fox News Poll.  That same poll put Biden’s approval rating at a dismal 43%, the lowest of this presidency, and only 37% approve of his handling of the economy.  When Biden delivered his first joint address to Congress last April, which is different from the State of the Union, he focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke to masked Congress members in a limited-capacity House chamber. This year, the president may declare a victory over the virus as new cases and hospitalizations continue to plunge across the country, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its indoor mask guidance.  In contrast to last year, all Congress members were invited to attend Biden’s address Tuesday and masks are optional.  Biden will also celebrate his new Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who will be the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court if confirmed.  Stalled legislative agenda  As far as his legislative agenda, Biden is expected to tout his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but his landmark proposals for "Build Back Better" and voting rights bills have failed to make any progress.  Biden is expected to avoid using the phrase "Build Back Better" in his State of the Union address and rather focus on individual programs and "lowering costs" for Americans amid rising inflation.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  A guest essay published by David Axelrod called on Biden to show a "little humility" during his speech and to tout his accomplishments but also acknowledge that Americans are "still in the grips of a national trauma" brought on by the pandemic.  "The state of the union is stressed," Axelrod wrote for The New York Times. "To claim otherwise — to highlight the progress we have made, without fully acknowledging the hard road we have traveled and the distance we need to go — would seem off-key and out of touch. You simply cannot jawbone Americans into believing that things are better than they feel."

An explosion at a regional state administration building Tuesday left about six people injured, while the Indian government confirmed an Indian student in Kharkiv died in shelling.  "Today, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv using rocket artillery," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video posted to his Facebook account. "This is, without any doubt, a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential neighborhoods. Not a single military object in sight."  ZELENSKYY'S POWERFUL SPEECH MOVES TRANSLATOR TO TEARS  Zelenskyy called for an international tribunal to investigate Russia’s actions, suggesting that they amounted to state terrorism. He called for Russia to be penalized through measures such as losing its permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council and closing airspace, ports and canals to Russian vehicles.  "For such a crime, there needs to be a tribunal. An international one. This is a violation of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you for the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. This is Ukraine. This is Europe. This is the year 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately," Zelenskyy said.

A second round of talks are slated to take place in the coming days.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is leading some U.S. politicians, experts and world leaders to question President Vladimir Putin’s mental stability.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who served under President George W. Bush, called Putin’s recent behavior "erratic."  LIVE UPDATES: UKRAINE'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY BOMBARDED WITH SHELLING DURING PEACE TALKS  "I met with him many times, and this is a different Putin," she said on Fox News Sunday. "He was always calculating and cold, but this is different. He seems erratic. There is an ever deepening, delusional rendering of history."  Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper echoed Rice’s assessment of the Russian ruler, who has grown increasingly frustrated over his failure to swiftly subdue Ukrainian forces.  "I personally think he’s unhinged," Clapper said Sunday on CNN. "I worry about his acuity and balance."  The concerns about Putin’s shaky mental health are particularly relevant given that he has his finger on the nuclear trigger, Clapper added.  Senior intelligence officials who have known Putin for decades told Fox News that he has been isolated for months at his presidential compound interacting exclusively with a small group of advisers and cronies.  A senior national security official under President Donald Trump, who asked for anonymity, said when Putin met with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month, he seemed "paranoid" and "unwilling to listen to reason."  During the meeting in Moscow, the men sat across an absurdly long marble table, as Macron tried to persuade Putin to stand down. After the failed effort at intervention, Macron privately described Putin as "more rigid, more isolated and fundamentally lost in a sort of ideological and security drift," according to a senior French official.  Longtime Putin ally, Czech President Milos Zeman, called the Russia leader a "madman" this week after he launched the invasion, according to The Guardian.  UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE 'REMARKABLE' BUT RUSSIA STILL HOLDS MAJOR ADVANTAGE  But Rebekah Koffler, former DIA intelligence officer and author of "Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America," told Fox News Digital that Putin is no mad man.  "Putin is absolutely not crazy. All this talk calling him crazy, it means we’re still not taking Putin seriously or understanding him," said Koffler,  "He’s not delusional, there are no mental anomalies," she added. "Putin is a cold-blooded, typical Russian autocratic leader and a very calculated risk-taker. He’s simply executing a plan that he has been hatching for 20 years."  Koffler said that calling Putin crazy is a cover-up for the U.S failure to appreciate Putin's ambitions or psychology.  President Joe Biden initially called the use of sanctions a deterrent. After the invasion, he reversed course and said he actually didn't think the economic penalties would prevent war.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "If anything, this conflict has exposed our lack of a viable counter-strategy to Putin's well-thought-out plan," Koffler said. "We’re grasping at straws right now."  Gillian Turner and the Associated Press contributed to this report

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the spotlight as many have praised the 44-year-old as a "true leader."  Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, but before becoming president of Ukraine, he was a successful entertainer.  Zelenskyy originally earned a law degree from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics, but instead of working in politics or law, he chose the entertainment industry. By 2010, Zelenskyy was one of the top entertainers in Ukraine, with his career mostly focused on comedy.  In 2003, Zelenskyy's production company, Kvartal 95, began producing television shows.  The Ukrainian president is most known for a role he landed in 2015, where he actually starred as the president of Ukraine. In "Servant of the People," he played Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko. The storyline follows a school teacher whose rant on politics goes viral and lands him in the leadership role.  STEVEN SEAGAL SPEAKS OUT AMID RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE: ‘I LOOK AT BOTH AS ONE FAMILY’  Zelenskyy launched his run for Ukrainian president following the success of "Servant of the People." The political party he ran under is even named after the hit TV series. "Servant of the People," the political party, was created in 2017 and registered in 2018.  Besides his role in "Servant of the People," Zelenskyy also voiced the famous Peruvian bear Paddington in Ukraine's version of "Paddington" and "Paddington 2," StudioCanal confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.

On top of acting and directing, the Ukrainian president has eight credits as a writer, according to IMDb.  Zelenskyy was elected to power in Ukraine in 2019. He promoted his presidential campaign online and went on a comedy tour, during which he made fun of his opponents. Zelenskyy won roughly 72% of the vote, according to the Central Election Commission.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, including Kyiv, Thursday morning.

A sole protester stood outside the complex known as the Russian Diplomatic Compound in New York City’s Riverdale neighborhood on Thursday, hours after a long-anticipated war began across the world in Ukraine.  The compound, a white high-rise tower located at 355 West 255th Street, sits at one of the highest points in New York City and has often been the subject of speculation surrounding the building's purpose and residents' practices. The building is home to Russian diplomats, many of whom work in the United States as intelligence officers – or intelligence "operatives," as the Russians call them – and seek information or connections that the federation might need, multiple experts told Fox News Digital.  "They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime." — Rebekah Koffler, author of ‘Putin’s Playbook' and former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Most Russian intelligence officers – those who work for the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or the federation's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU – live in the building, which is known to some law enforcement officers as the "plex," said Robin Dreeke, a retired FBI special agent and former head of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program.  But some senior-level Russian intelligence officers and select others are allowed to rent homes in the Riverdale area itself, Dreeke said. And the existence of the intelligence officers living among New Yorkers is common knowledge to some, he added.  "Open secret is a good way to put it," Dreeke said, when asked. "I think they think it’s more of a secret than we do."  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  When asked on whom or what these intelligence officers might be spying, Dreeke said, "everything."  "A lot of people think that spies are just going for the high-level classified military infrastructure kind of stuff," Dreeke continued. While that is true, "the real purpose of spying/intelligence collection is filling information gaps that another country has, and mostly to provide their policymakers and decision-makers the knowledge they need that's not common knowledge that they can get through legitimate means."  Dreeke has first-hand experience with the compound, as he spent hours outside the building during his time with the FBI New York’s Russian Military Intelligence Squad from 1997 to 2005. To put it simply, his unit tried to recruit Russian spies and then neutralize them to protect American interests, national security and NATO allies.  MOLOTOV COCKTAILS ON THE MENU: UKRAINIAN BREWERY SWITCHES FROM BEER TO BOMBS AMID RUSSIAN INVASION  He remained involved with numerous operations related to GRU officers throughout his career. He later founded a company, People Formula, and has since authored several books.  TWO TYPES OF INTEL OFFICERS  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  There are two types of intelligence officers, Dreeke said: those who pose a symmetrical threat, and those who pose an asymmetrical threat. Those working in New York and living at the "plex" and working at the mission to the United Nations are under "diplomatic cover."  "It’s what we called a ‘symmetrical threat.’ We know they’re here. They’re diplomats under diplomatic cover, so they actually have all the privileges of diplomats. So, when they’re caught conducting espionage against our country, you can’t throw them in jail, because they’re diplomats," Dreeke continued.  He added: "No one likes it. But it’s a fact of life."  But they’re different from the undercover operatives who are not under official cover and are in the United States. Those who pose an "asymmetrical threat," undercover operatives such as Jack Barsky, who operate under non-official cover, under "false pretenses, with fake names."  Barsky grew up in East Germany and was later recruited by the now-defunct KGB, Russia’s security agency, before it ultimately became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). According to a biography on his website, he lived a double life in America for 10 years – during which time he worked as a spy for the Soviet Union. Barsky left the job and was later arrested by the FBI. He is now an American citizen who has become a prominent author and public speaker.  Only diplomats live in the Russian compound in Riverdale, meaning any Russian intelligence officer who has asymmetrical intentions would not. Similar compounds are located anywhere in the country where there is a Russian consulate, Dreeke said.  PUTIN PAINTED INTO A CORNER AS WORLD LEADERS, MAJOR COMPANIES AND EVEN SOME OF HIS PEOPLE TURN AGAINST HIM  There are Russian diplomats living inside the complex who are not intelligence officers, he went on. "And then you have others that, they do the diplomatic job probably one or two hours a day. And the rest of the day is spent collecting intelligence" to fill information gaps and then sending that information to the Russian government in Moscow, he said.  DOING ‘THEIR HOMEWORK’  Rebekah Koffler, a Russian-born former intelligence officer for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, called the process of having intelligence officers stationed in parts of the world "a standard procedure."  "The United States also has intelligence officers posted all over the world," she said. As for the Russian compound in Riverdale, the Russian intelligence officers who live there "don’t necessarily spy on that community. They spy in general – they spy on the United States."  Koffler and Dreeke noted the diligence with which Russian intelligence officers do their research, which they then use to form their policies and operations.  "They do their homework," Koffler said. "That's the one thing that is very different from the way that we do things. We're just not nearly as diligent."  Koffler, author of "Putin’s Playbook," added that Russian intelligence officers "do their homework for years," regardless of whether the information is pertinent to current events.  "They collect regardless – the Russians and the Chinese do – Because that's just how they do business," Koffler went on. "They view us as threat number one. And sooner or later, they believe that information will be useful, whether it's for wartime or peacetime, when they want to undermine and somehow cause some kind of disruption."  PUTIN IS PLAYING 'POKER' WITH USA AND EUROPEAN ALLIES, TRYING TO 'BLUFF,' EXPERT SAYS  Russian intelligence officers who are in the United States under diplomatic cover are not necessarily interested in the people who live in the neighborhood. They will try to make friendships and become close with people whom the Russian government deems potentially useful, such as government officials or their friends – "somebody from whom they can collect information," Koffler explained.  "It’s not like they try to steal your wallet or your purse and get your information that way," she said. "It’s called targeteering – they identify, ‘OK, we need a list, we need somebody in your State Department,’ or, ‘We need somebody at the United Nations’ … and they do their homework and they study" their target, Koffler further said.  She went on: "Where does this or that person hang out? Do they play golf, for example? Once they identify who exactly they need, what kind of access, they figure out that person's patterns of behavior … they would show up, like, on a tennis court if you are playing tennis. And they would strike a conversation with you and try to be your friend. And you have no idea that you've been targeted because it all looks so innocuous and accidental."  Dreeke said Russian intelligence officers are looking to get to classified or proprietary information as well as those individuals who are in the position to know about it. The information they’re seeking can depend on the "flavor of the day."  During his time investigating Russian operatives and goals, Chechnya was among the topics of importance for the federation, Dreeke said.  "They wanted to know what different organizations were due to support or defend Chechnya," he said. "Cancer research, believe it or not, was a huge one … They were also tracking shipping – of all kinds of things, they’re tracking things like MRE [meals ready-to-eat] … because that might tell you where the U.S. forces are building up or not building up."  Based on his experience, Dreeke estimated that 95% to 98% of the information that intelligence officers are collecting is "benign," while the remaining 5% to 2% is classified – "it is proprietary that does that greater damage."  ANTENNAS  Located on tree-lined West 255th Street and Mosholu Avenue, the building is 20 stories high, and features 15 residential units per floor, according to The Riverdale Press.  "The Russians constructed it on top of the hill so they could actually have good radio receiving and transmissions from that point," Dreeke said. "They strategically bought on that property, so they could actually monitor the radio traffic, as well."  "Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia’s Master Spy in America after the End of the Cold War," a book written by Pete Earley, describes the compound as having a flat roof under which there were "dozens of antennas designed to match signals and conversations from New York City’s airwaves."  Dreeke noted that while he was not heavily involved with the technology, the antennas were known to be used for sending and receiving coded messages, as well as for collecting information.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "If they can collect it, they collect it," he said. "[The] Russians are great at sucking in every bit of information they can because their analytical machine back in Moscow is really, really good."  He added: "The antennas are used for transmitting and the antennas are used for collecting. And whatever the flavor of the day is, that’s what they’ll suck in."

Freezing Russian central bank asset transactions  In conjunction and cooperation with the European Union, Japan, the U.K., Canada, and others, the United States has effectively frozen financial transactions of Russian central bank assets held by Americans, a senior administration official told reporters during a briefing on Monday.  The intended effect is to cripple the Russian economy and use up the country's "rainy day fund" as its currency, the ruble, plummets in value, the official said. That rainy day fund was built up to defend against economic consequences when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.  According to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), this is not a complete and total block of the central bank, as OFAC is authorizing certain transactions with Russia's central bank that are "energy-related." OFAC added that additional authorizations could follow if necessary.

SWIFT provides messaging services to banks in over 200 countries, and is controlled by the central banks of the G-10, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and Sweden.  In addition, the statement noted that the group of countries would launch a "transatlantic task force" aimed at effectively implementing the financial sanctions, "step up" coordination against disinformation regarding the Russian invasion, and limit "golden passports" that allow wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government to become citizens of the countries.  Export controls  On Thursday, the Commerce Department unveiled sweeping export controls from its Bureau of Industry and Security that would severely restrict Russia's access to technologies and other items used by its defense, aerospace and maritime sectors.  Items targeted by the export controls include semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers and sensors. In addition, BIS's rule imposes stringent controls on 49 Russian military end users, which have been added to its entity list.  The European Union, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand announced that they would implement "substantially similar restrictions."

"We tentatively assume that Russia’s economy will contract 20% [quarter-over-quarter], saar, in 2Q, and for the year around 3.5%. But the margin of error for any such guesstimate is incredibly high at this point, and risks are skewed heavily to the downside," the note reads. " Moreover, we believe Russia’s growing political and economic isolation will curtail Russia’s growth potential in years to come and lower Russia’s trend growth to 1.0%, down from 1.75% previously."  The bank's researchers estimate that Russian inflation could stand at 10% at year-end, up from 5.3%, with risks heavily skewed to the upside.  In response to the sanctions, Russia's central bank has raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% to counter risks of rouble depreciation and higher inflation, ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues and restarted gold buying.

Tuesday Joe Biden will come to Capitol Hill and give the annual State of the Union Address. No matter how hard he tries, he will not be able to hide the fact that America is in crisis.  It’s not just one crisis, either: a war in Europe, the worst inflation in 40 years, the worst violent crime in 25 years, the highest gas prices in 7 years, the most illegal border crossings ever recorded, and the deadly, disgraceful surrender in Afghanistan. Joe Biden created each one of these crises, and they have led to another crisis: a complete lack of credibility from the bully pulpit.  BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: WHAT LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WANT TO HEAR  Tuesday's speech will be overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hundreds of innocent Ukrainians are dead. Joe Biden probably won’t mention tonight how he failed to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline just months after taking office, and blocked sanctions again while Vladimir Putin moved troops to the Ukrainian border.  Joe Biden will praise his own sanctions of Russia, yet, in reality, they have been too little, too late. He has intentionally avoided sanctioning Vladimir Putin’s energy industry, which is the cash cow funding the invasion and propping up the entire regime.  Joe Biden will probably tell the American people that energy prices are going up because of the war in Ukraine. He will also blame coronavirus, China, and big corporations. In other words, he will blame everyone but himself for America’s historic inflation.  The truth is that Joe Biden has not just poured fuel on the fire of inflation—he has been a pyromaniac, taking inflation to a 40-year high. Last March he signed the single largest spending bill in American history. He put two trillion dollars on America’s credit card and flooded the country with government cash. Since then, prices have gone up faster than wages.  Joe Biden has tried again and again to talk his way out of the problem, and he will try it again tonight. For months he told us inflation would be "transitory." In December he said inflation had "peaked."  He was dead wrong on both of these claims and the American people are reminded of it every time they go to the gas station or the grocery store. It is no wonder Joe Biden’s approval rating on the number one concern of the American people is just 31 percent.  Tuesday Joe Biden will likely tell us that we need to give him trillions and trillions more to spend. Yet this is exactly what got us into this inflation crisis in the first place. More spending means more taxes, more debt, and ultimately more inflation. No matter what the President says tonight, the American people are saying, no, thank you.  Joe Biden will have to mention the crime wave sweeping Democrat cities. America has recently experienced the most dramatic increase in murder in American history. Last year 16 cities broke records for homicides, all of them run by Democrats. These cities include major urban areas like Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia.  Democrat politicians have stoked hostility against police officers—a hostility that has led to record-high retirements as well as record-high killings of police officers in 2021.  Yet Tuesday Joe Biden won’t talk about the real roots of crime. He will say nothing about left-wing prosecutors and letting criminals go free. He won’t talk about how his party made its motto "Defund the Police." He won’t talk about how he nominated radical liberals to high positions of the Justice Department. Instead he is going to push for Congress to attack our Second Amendment rights.  He couldn’t be more wrong. Responsible legal gun ownership is fully protected by the Constitution and provides protections for citizens in their own homes.  Tuesday Joe Biden will likely avoid talking about the crisis on our Southern Border, which is the worst in American history. Two million illegal immigrants have been apprehended by border patrol since Joe Biden became president. On his watch, immigration enforcement inside our borders has ground to a halt. Immigration agents are averaging fewer than one arrest per month because their hands are tied by Joe Biden’s open borders policies.  American families are the ones paying the price for this radical agenda as Mexican drug cartels flood across the border with heroin and fentanyl.

As the Kremlin-backed Russia Today network is banished and dropped in Europe and Canada following the invasion of Ukraine, the American affiliate of RT continues to broadcast from Washington, D.C.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sunday that RT, as well as fellow global Russian outlet Sputnik, would be banned in the European Union, calling them the "Kremlin's media machine" and adding the EU was "developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation." Major Canadian television providers also announced this past weekend that they would drop RT from their lineups.  It's leading to questions at home about what should be done, if anything, about the green-logoed network whose motto as a state-backed news organ is "Question More."  Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler said RT and other propaganda abroad were part of the permanent cyber warfare Russia wages on the West.  NETFLIX SAYS IT WON'T AIR KREMLIN TV CHANNELS INSIDE RUSSIA, DEFYING NEW GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVE  "They don't just wage propaganda in a time of war, during a conflict," she told Fox News Digital. "They wage it during peacetime. They constantly malign the United States and misrepresent foreign policy objectives … I'm just saying that tilts the level playing field towards Russia when we allow their propaganda channels to broadcast in an unfettered [way]."  RT America isn't unsubtle pro-Vladimir Putin propaganda 24 hours a day, as it also airs celebrity and sports news, but the editorial content unquestionably skews to put a shine on a Russian version of events. In 2017, the U.S. government required RT to register as a foreign agent.  "RT is 100% a Russia government-controlled channel and its sole intent is to predispose the American population and wherever they are broadcasting towards the Russian point of view and to present the events on the ground as the Russians want the rest of the world to see them, so if the United States did not want that to happen then it would be appropriate to shut down the channel," Koffler said.  RT America likely has a tiny television audience – the Washington Post noted Nielsen doesn't even measure it and the channel isn't available on most cable subscriptions – but it has a large social media following, with millions of followers and subscribers on Twitter and YouTube.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Much of RT.com's website reads like Kremlin press releases, with headlines Monday like, "Putin slams West’s ‘empire of lies’," and "No plans to occupy Ukraine, Russia tells UN." The website did report on arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, however.  On television on Monday, one RT show's chyron simply read, "DEMILITARIZE AND DENAZIFY," repeating the Kremlin line that the invasion was meant to free Ukraine from Nazi rule. Ukraine's president is Jewish and some of his relatives died in the Holocaust. Last week, journalist Dan Cohen told RT America viewers it was "absolutely false" that Russia was the aggressor toward Ukraine and said Putin's depiction of the conflict as a "denazification campaign" was "absolutely accurate."  Fox News contributor and former national security official KT McFarland disagreed with calls to yank RT America from the country's airwaves, even for an autocratic government mouthpiece.  "I believe in freedom of the press, even if the press outlet is the propaganda arm of the Russian government," McFarland told Fox News Digital. "However, I strongly encourage dissident Russians, Ukrainian freedom fighters and others around the world who are standing up to Putin's aggression to counter with their own online podcasts and programming."  She added she would also encourage tech and social media companies to help get their messages out in the United States and the rest of the world, but particularly in Russia.  RUSSIA'S FAILURES COULD LEAD TO MORE INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS AGAINST UKRAINIANS, FORMER NAVY INTEL OFFICER SAYS  Politico media writer Jack Shafer agreed, writing Saturday that the U.S. would be foolish to give RT the "enticing flavor of forbidden fruit" by banishing it.  "Ideas, we generally agree, must fight for themselves, against ‘legitimate’ contenders, fringe positions or outright propaganda. The government that insists on babysitting its citizens by endorsing some speakers and throttling others, is doing them no favor," he wrote.  RT America played up the network's banishment in Europe, inviting on a "political lecturer" Monday who called the EU's decision "totalitarianism."  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki addressed RT and Sputnik in a briefing on Feb. 3, saying she hadn't discussed the outlets with President Biden but said it was "pretty factual" that they were propaganda tools for Russia.  "Does the President have any position on the activity, the presence of outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik? … Because in some countries, they’re seen as out-and-out propaganda tools of the Kremlin. Given that things are fairly frosty with Putin right now, what’s the position on that?" a reporter asked.  "I have not spoken with the President about RT or Sputnik," Psaki said. "I think it’s pretty factual to say they are tools of propaganda who work on behalf of the Russian government. I don’t know that anyone would question that … But I have not discussed that with him specifically."  "I think there’s no question, as we’re trying to decipher information that’s accurate and inaccurate, it’s important for the American people to know that there are outlets working on behalf of foreign governments who have an agenda, and they’re not playing the role of free press and free media as you all are," she added.

A Ukrainian American woman who lives near Boston, Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital on Monday that she can no longer speak on the phone with her own mother, who lives in southern Ukraine, because of the Russian attacks on Ukraine and the fear these attacks have engendered.  Many people in southern Ukraine — as well as throughout the country — are right now living in fear for their lives as Russian soldiers overtake the area, the Boston-area woman said.  Babies are being born in the midst of war — "and some of the newborns are dying."  Some people have had their cellphones taken away by incoming soldiers as Russian forces take control of a town and several surrounding villages there, the woman reported.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  Also, the Boston-area woman said she’s become aware of the "humanitarian catastrophe" taking place in Nova Khohovka in Kherson Oblast, in southern Ukraine, right now.  UKRAINIAN FAMILY'S HEARTBREAK AS FATHER MUST SAY GOODBYE TO HIS SON  The Boston-area woman, whose first name is Katya, is sharing what she knows about the events in southern Ukraine with others in the U.S. because she wants more people to be aware of what is happening, she said.  She fears for her mother's life and for the lives of the other people she knows there.  "The town of Nova Kokhovka is surrounded [by Russian soldiers], and several other villages in that area are also occupied," the Boston-area woman told Fox News Digital on Monday morning.  "There has been no water, food or medical aid [for the Ukrainian people there] for two or three days," the same woman told Fox News Digital.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  Also, she said, babies are being born in the midst of war — "and some of the newborns are dying."  The Boston-area woman of Ukrainian descent also told Fox News Digital that in southern Ukraine, "doctors and paramedics are being held captive in hospitals to treat wounded Russian soldiers. They are not permitted to treat local [Ukrainian] citizens."  PRAY FOR ‘THE SAFETY OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE,’ SAYS PASTOR  A Russia expert whom Fox News Digital consulted about the personal narrative as laid out here said that it "rings true" to her.  "When the Russians fight a war, they fight as a ‘whole of nation’ and they attack the adversary as a ‘whole of nation,’ as well," said Rebekah Koffler, author of "Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America" and a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer.  "Unlike Americans," said Koffler, "the Russians do not take serious precautions to keep the civilian casualties low." Instead, she said, "they aim to achieve the mission, i.e. defeat the adversary."  RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE: ‘BABIES AND CHILDREN PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE’  Koffler added, "It’s a different mentality. Having sacrificed 20 million people to fight [against] Nazi Germany [in WWII] and annihilated roughly the same amount during Stalin’s ‘red terror’ period, the Russians have a high tolerance for casualties. In fact, it is part of their strategy and war-fighting style ‘to out-suffer the adversary,’ and to inflict the level of suffering on the adversary that will compel him to abandon the fight."  The slaughtered family members — five people in all — are shown lying on a road outside their car.  She added, "Atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in the Chechen conflict are well documented, plus in Syria (the bombing of hospitals), etc."  ‘Tried to leave’  The Boston-area woman, Katya, said a family "who tried to leave" one of the local villages in southern Ukraine "was killed," she told Fox News Digital on Monday.  Fox News Digital was shown graphic video of the bodies of the slaughtered family members — five people in all — lying on a road outside their destroyed car.  Fox News Digital was also shown video of a dramatic car escape as a Ukrainian family desperately drove away from Russian soldiers who shot at their passing car along a highway.  The Boston-area woman told Fox News Digital that one of the people she knows in Ukraine "managed to hold onto her phone," though many other people there have had their phones taken away or no longer have internet service.  DRAMATIC VIDEO TAKEN FROM SPEEDING CAR SHOWS UKRAINE DEVASTATION  The woman is "traumatized" by the violence her relatives are suffering, another Ukrainian American in the U.S. who knows her told Fox News Digital. This other woman is also fearful for the safety of Ukrainians right now as they endure the Russian attacks.  John Wayne Troxell, former Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (retired), told Fox News Digital on Monday in a phone interview that the members of the Ukrainian armed forces that he knows are continuing to "stand and fight" against the Russian invaders.  In so doing, he said, "they are following the lead of their military leadership — they're going to stand and fight to the death for their country."  UKRAINE'S CHILDREN: HOW TO HELP VULNERABLE KIDS AMONG RUSSIA'S ATTACK  It is "so admirable," he added, that these Ukrainians are standing strong for their country — "and not just those in the military, but the citizens."  He also said, however, that those he knows in Ukraine are aware they will have very tough nights ahead of them — including this week.

"Mom I'm no longer in Crimea," Ukraine representative Sergiy Kyslytsya started while holding up a screenshot of the texts, according to C-SPAN footage. "I'm not in training sessions.

No sane American approves of what Russia has done in Ukraine. We certainly don't and we don't know anyone who does.  On Twitter, you see Democrats pretending that their political opponents are responsible for the invasion and somehow support it. So, Joe Biden and his staff so mismanaged the world that Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine after Biden told us for months he could prevent that from happening, and yet all of it is your fault. So, that's a slanderous lie.  In this country, virtually everyone understands that the invasion of Ukraine is bad. It's bad for us and for the world and Vladimir Putin is bad too. So, effectively in America, those are settled facts. We can stop debating them. The question is: What do we do next? Vladimir Putin's badness doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to think clearly about how to protect this country and the rest of the free world, in that order.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  In fact, Putin's badness makes wise decision-making in the United States more important than ever and yet at the same time, it makes wise decision-making harder to achieve. It's not easy to see the long view when you're angry. A writer called Tanner Greer wrote a piece this morning, which you should read. It's entitled, "Pausing at the Precipice." Greer began by pointing out that Russia has obviously earned our content. Most Americans now despise Vladimir Putin, and that's understandable. They're outraged, but moral outrage is not enough. Moral outrage is not a foreign policy.  In fact, Greer writes, moral outrage can be counterproductive. It's clarifying, but here's the downside. "A righteous reaction may be a dangerous one...In the field of power politics, it is outcomes, not intentions, that matter most. Failure to slow down and examine the assumptions and motivations behind our choices may lead to decisions that feel right in the moment, but fail to safeguard our interests, secure our values, or reduce the human toll of war in the long run."  Exactly. Nicely put. Another way to express it would be this: Our leaders could easily turn this tragic and volatile moment into a historic disaster. They've done it before. As of tonight, here are the two main things we ought to be worried about going forward: First, and most obviously, this war could get much worse than it already is. We could see many Americans die.  Joe Biden is telling us he will not commit American troops to Ukraine. Biden also claimed he opposed vaccine mandates. So is he telling the truth? Even if he is telling the truth about his intentions in this case, Biden can't see the future. Biden has no idea what will happen tomorrow or next week, much less next year. Nobody does.  We do know that already many in Washington are pushing for a hot war with nuclear-armed Russia. They're demanding a no-fly zone over Ukraine. That means American forces would shoot down Russian jets in Ukrainian airspace and also take out radar installations and other facilities within Russia itself. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on board with this. Why wouldn't he be? He's asked Joe Biden for an American-enforced no-fly zone, but as we said, many in Congress are for it, too. Here's Adam Kinzinger:  REP. ADAM KINZINGER: I think this is time where we need to, at the invitation of Ukraine, declare Ukraine a no-fly zone enforced by NATO and the United States. We certainly have the capability to do that. The airspace is still contested by the Ukrainians and we could certainly shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground.  IN LA’S EASTERN EUROPEAN DIASPORA, SOLIDARITY FOR UKRAINE  "We can shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground." So that's a lie. It's hard to overstate how dishonest Kinzinger's claim is. Shooting down Russian planes and taking out radar installations would, by definition, entail engaging Russian troops. If Vladimir Putin is even half as evil and crazy as they tell us he is, and he may be, that could easily spiral into nuclear conflict.  So, you would only suggest that if you had nothing to lose, and Adam Kinzinger, of course, he doesn't. His political career is over. He's disgraced. He has literally nothing to lose. But many of us have a lot to lose—our country. We have children. So, we should pause before we do that, but no pausing allowed.  Adam Kinzinger thinks you're a traitor if you're worried about where this might go. "This breathlessness over nukes is mind-blowing," Kinzinger wrote over the weekend— nothing bad will happen. And maybe nothing bad will happen, but something very bad could happen, and it could happen fast.  Adults know that. Anyone with experience knows that. Watch any war in history. And yet tonight, amazingly some of those adults, and they are adults, favor this anyway. Two former Supreme allied commanders of NATO, Wes Clark and Philip Breedlove are pushing for armed confrontation with the Russian military.  In an interview with Foreign Policy Magazine, Breedlove was honest enough to acknowledge that a no-fly zone would amount to "an act of war," and it would. Thank you for saying so out loud, but Breedlove said he's for it anyway. OK, so this is the moment when a functioning news media would step in and start to ask basic questions about what happens next. War with Russia, fine.  What does that mean, exactly? How far is the United States and its population, who would fight that war, prepared to take this conflict and to what end? Once we start bombing Russia, will Putin withdraw his forces from Ukraine? What will be left of Ukraine by that point? How are we sure that Putin, who we say is deranged, won't go nuclear if a war with him begins? And then, among many other questions, what will China's role in this war be?  Thanks to the efforts of the Biden White House, China is now Vladimir Putin's strongest ally. The Chinese have just signed a long-term energy deal with Russia. They now have skin in the game. Russia will be powering China's economy going forward. Good job, Biden White House. But because that's true, how sure we that the Chinese will stay out of a war?  UKRAINE GIVES BIDEN ‘OPPORTUNITY’ TO ‘REBOOT’ PRESIDENCY DURING SOTU, ACCORDING TO MEDIA  How do we know they won't take down our digital infrastructure, which they seem to some great extent to control in this country… etc? You can think of many questions, but reporters aren't asking any of them. Asking questions is now immoral. Richard Engel, who knows better, he's the chief foreign correspondent at NBC, is now demanding that American troops fight the Russian army. It's a moral imperative.  "A massive Russian convoy is about 30 miles from Kyiv, the US/NATO could likely destroy it, but that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?"  And of course, the answer is implied. We can't watch in silence. That would be immoral. If you're a good person, you will support a war that could very easily turn into a nuclear conflict. Again, this is moral blackmail. No one in America takes pride at the sight, feels anything but revulsion at the sight, of Russian troops within Ukraine. It's wrong. It's destabilizing to the world. It is, in fact, against our values, but how we respond is the question. Thoughtfully, has to be the answer unless we're prepared to risk massive consequences.  Now Richard Haass, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, would under normal circumstances, be exactly the man you would go to for a wise and reasoned perspective on what to do next. That's his job. Whatever you think of the Council on Foreign Relations, and we don't think much, they're not a radical organization. Their job is to think through the consequences of action. But not anymore. Richard Haass is foursquare in favor of a hot war with Russia. He's calling for "regime change in Moscow" because no doubt they'll greet us as liberators. What could go wrong? Here's Richard Haass:  RICHARD HAASS: We need now a response of necessity to his war of choice and there's got to be to raise the economic costs at home, to raise the military costs on the ground. I hate to be so blunt, but the most vulnerable thing that...Putin's vulnerable to is dead Russian soldiers. So, we have to make sure Ukraine has the means to...resist.  When did a guy that irresponsible take over the Council on Foreign Relations? And of course, that's not his real job, the Council on Foreign Relations, his real job is being a cable news pundit, and that's kind of the problem with the level of discourse around this war. The problem is that when real people with jobs that convey actual authority start talking like cable news guests, things could go sideways very fast. "Dead Russian soldiers."  BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: WHAT LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WANT TO HEAR  So it's hardly a defense of Vladimir Putin to point out once again that a shooting war with Russia could have massive consequences for us because it's not just Russian soldiers who would die. Americans would die too, potentially many of them. And, by the way, it's not all certain we would win that war. Sorry, it's not. Ask anyone who's familiar with the current state of readiness of the U.S. military. Is victory a foregone conclusion? Is this the roll into Baghdad? No, it's not. This is not Saddam Hussein we're talking about.  So again, the point is, are we ready for all of this? We're moving down a path that could result in the destruction of the United States. Americans may be mad at Putin, understandably, but they're wary of where our leaders are taking this next. A new CNN poll, for example, shows a strong majority of Americans, speaking of democracy, oppose direct military action against Russia. Are they all traitors? Are they all pro-Putin? Probably not.  At the very least, they would like, and we could use, a sober national conversation about the potential consequences of where people like Richard Haass are taking us now. That's the opposite of what we're getting. Instead, we're getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger sitting in his office making bellicose noises on social media. Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian Air Ace called the Ghost of Kyiv. He downed Russian MiGs left and right.  Well, turns out the whole thing was a hoax, but of course, Adam Kinzinger had no idea because he knows nothing. "The #ghostofKyiv has a name and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force," he tweeted. Imagine a sitting member of Congress tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment.  "He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force." Really? Get some respect. People are dying, buffoon. Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image of the comedian, Sam Hyde, sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter...he is, once again, a comedian. That was Adam Kinzinger. These are the people pushing us toward a new world war.  So, at the very least, let's pause and think this through. That seems fair and as we do that, it is also worth considering what's happening here in the United States, concurrent with this war and justified by this war and by that, we are speaking of the assault on civil liberties now underway. It would be ironic if a defense of democracy, on the other side of the world, led to an erosion of democracy here and yet that seems to be where we're heading.  NYT CLAIMS BIDEN ‘REDEFINING THE ARC OF HIS PRESIDENCY,’ GIVES POSITIVE REVIEW FOR HANDLING OF RUSSIA, SCOTUS  You'll notice that the moment that Russian troops rolled across the border into Ukraine, Democrats wasted no time in attacking not just Putin, but their political opponents in this country. What did they have to do with it? Isn't war the moment for unity? We're all in this together, but they leverage this war and the human suffering that inevitably entails to make partisan points.  One MSNBC regular, in one of the stranger moments you'll see on television (MSNBC has had a lot of those recently) said the whole conflict was the result of a plot engineered by Vladimir Putin's mole, who happened to be the former president of the United States.  SARAH KENDZIOR, PHD: Trump was installed as the president of the United States in order to weaken the alliances that were preventing Putin from achieving his goals— alliances like NATO, our relationship with our European partners, our relationship with Ukraine. Trump was put in as a bulldozer.  OK, so we spent maybe three years holding up the lunacy of the Russiagate people and the lying as evidence that maybe they shouldn't have a meaningful effect on our national conversation about politics and yet somehow, through a very unfortunate confluence of events, those very same unbalanced people are now having a measurable effect on our foreign policy and if you think we're overstating the lunacy, try to follow the logic here. This is what she just told us.  So Donald Trump, that would be Putin's man in the White House, tells Europe not to become dependent upon Russian oil, as he did, and to pay more for their own military defense, which he also did and was scoffed at, by the way. And yet, for some reason, Putin then waits to invade Ukraine until his man in the White House is gone and playing golf in Florida and now it is Donald Trump's fault that Europe is dependent on Russia for energy. It was all part of Putin's plan. Republicans wanted this to happen all along.  You can imagine MSNBC viewers, the ones sat through years of this, nodding along "yes." Now the pee tape makes sense. What's scary about this is that it's not confined to MSNBC. The overlap between MSNBC guests shouting nonsensical partisan talking points and true conspiracy theories and Democratic policy-makers is profound. So Democratic lawmakers now pretending there's a large and dangerous fifth column in the United States working for Vladimir Putin, which there is not. And as always, they're talking about themselves.  Eric Swalwell, for example, he recently took the maximum possible campaign donation from a lobbyist for Nord Stream 2 AG. Now that's the company making the pipeline that will give Russia greater control over Europe's energy grid and from which the Russian government profits.  So. Eric Swalwell is taking money from the Russians and by the way, this is a guy who had sex with a Chinese spy. Has he had sex with Russian spies? We don't know, but you'll notice the one guy who probably shouldn't be calling other people traitors, as he takes money from Russian energy interests, is whipping around and accusing everyone else of rooting for the Russians.  ERIC SWALWELL: We have Republicans who are rooting for Russia and that makes it very hard for President Biden to get the whole country to go along when Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and Tucker Carlson are rooting for Russians and that's being replayed on Russia TV to rally Russians for this cause.  You know, it's such an awful thing to say. We hesitated even to play that. It's very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn't make sense, but it makes political sense. It is an effort to cover their own tracks. Our Foreign policy establishment failed to constrain Vladimir Putin.  To bring you back to ancient history like a week ago, they were telling us that sanctions and arming the Ukrainian military would prevent a Russian invasion. Now, they were wrong about that. They've been wrong many times, most recently in Afghanistan and in fact, now that we're casting blame, if there is any single American who deserves scorn and yes, blame for the invasion of Ukraine, it would be Joe Biden.  Of course, it was his job, self-described job, to prevent it. But of course, they won't admit that. Instead, they're attacking you and they're doing it with partisan goals in mind. Democrats plan to use the Ukraine invasion, this would become very obvious in the last three days, in the very same way they used January 6th.  So bad event takes place. No one really is for it. No one defended the riot on January 6th. We certainly didn't. But history is written immediately for partisan ends. So then you take the hysteria ginned up over that event, some of it legitimate, by the way, people have a right to be upset, and you use that to purge the country of the Democratic Party's political opponents.  So what do they really hate? Well, listen to them. They hate populist politics. They hate populist politics in this country far more than they hate Vladimir Putin. So they're using this opportunity, this war in Eastern Europe, to shut down domestic dissent in the United States and you're seeing it as always in our allies first.  BUCK SEXTON: BIDEN’S ‘HOSTILITY’ TO ENERGY PRODUCTION WEAKENED US POSITION AGAINST RUSSIAN INVASION  Several of them, including Canada, have banned journalists who don't agree with their view of the war. Again, if we're going to protect democracy, that should start at home and democracy is defined, literally defined, by the tolerance of the regime for dissent. But no dissent is allowed. So they've pulled RT off the airwaves in Canada, we did that long ago, and that led Mother Jones Magazine to ask this question today:  "Both RT and Sputnik air in the United States, too." Untrue, but whatever they don't know. "Will Biden follow suit and crackdown on pro-Russia disinformation? If he does, U.S. cable companies will also need to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, whose shows— Tucker Carlson's in particular— have parodied pro-Russia talking points.".  OK, so Putin invades Ukraine, self-evidently a tragedy bad for the United States, and we're using that as a justification because we care so much about democracy to shut down any news organization, any journalist who questions the Democratic Party? OK. How did we get here anyway? How corroded have these people become that they're calling for government censorship of dissent and telling us their defenders of democracy? That's just the beginning. Anyone who supports voter I.D. laws is a Kremlin agent, too. You're seeing how they're going to use this? Here's Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee to explain:  SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI: We talked about the fact that the invasion, the assault on Ukraine, was an assault on democracy. Barbara took the time to talk about assaults on our democracy in our own country.  REP. BARBARA LEE: The fight for democracy is taking place throughout the world. It's not only in Ukraine, but it's in our own country, and we've seen this through the campaigns of misinformation and disinformation. We see this happening in Ukraine. The fact that now we see those at times take away the voting rights of people of color, of African-Americans, of young people, of seniors, of the disabled.  You know, it's not even worth parsing the logic of something like that. You can only feel deep sadness that the people you just saw represent you in our Legislature, but by the way, as long as we're punishing people who are allied with hostile foreign interests, just to restate the obvious, China is now Russia's strongest ally in this war and that has real implications for people like, I don't know Nancy Pelosi, whose family has gotten rich from China or the entire American financial sector, or Hollywood, or all the people who are now profiting from Vladimir Putin's closest ally . Will they divest of those investments?  We'll see. But in the meantime, you should be very aware that there are partisan forces trying to use the war in Ukraine to accomplish political objectives here domestically and gain more power for themselves. It's not just about voting rights or shutting down Fox News.  RUSSIA COMPLAINS TO US AND CANADA ABOUT UKRAINE PROTESTS NEAR EMBASSIES  It's about shutting you up personally, your ability to express yourself and if you doubt that, you should know that Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia just wrote a letter to his donors, the tech monopolies demanding that they, "restrict the spread of Russian propaganda."  He did not define the term "Russian propaganda" and as a show that has been accused of disseminating it repeatedly, we can tell you we're all sensitive on the topic and you should be too. So, Warner went on television recently to report that his donors and Big Tech quickly complied with his demand.  DAVID IGNATIUS: You sent letters on Friday to our leading social media companies: Meta, which runs Facebook, Alphabet, Reddit, asking them to take action to prevent Russian state media, Russian propaganda operations, from appearing on their platforms. When I ask, have you received any responses yet to your request that they take that action?  SEN MARK WARNER: Well, David, the short answer is yes. Virtually every one of these platforms has taken down some of the Russian activity or demonetized, so they're not making money off of RT or Russian ads on real time during the platforms. That's good. I commend these...platforms.  So, contrast that with MSNBC. MSNBC is when dumb people do propaganda and tell you that Russia invading Ukraine is somehow about racism in the American South or something. I mean, it's nonsensical.  Sen. Mark Warner is when smart people do propaganda. You'll notice that Ignatius said Russian state media or Russian propaganda. To just be completely clear, Warner is not talking about banning Russian state media. He's talking about banning Russian propaganda, a term that he gets to define. He's talking about censoring the opinions of Americans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Now, to be clear, that is not allowed in a democracy. In a democracy, citizens who rule have an absolute right to have any opinion they want. Period. That's not an ancillary freedom. That's not just some random thing that we have as an added bonus as Americans.  That freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, is the central freedom we have. It's the whole point of the country and there is no point in supporting Ukraine if our leaders ignore our own bill of rights, and we should demand that they respect our Bill of Rights before they take a single step forward in defense of any other democracy. Period.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the February 28, 2022 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

Europe is facing a transformational moment in history as it battles for its future. Russia’s actions in recent weeks, but especially the past days, should be a final wake-up call to those who value the rule of law and freedom. Russia has manipulated the balance of power shift to its benefit.  The consequences of Russia’s belligerence in Ukraine will, unfortunately, be even higher energy prices for Americans, and greater energy insecurity in Europe. American leadership must right the ship before it’s too late.  Europe is no stranger to President Putin’s use of energy as a weapon. After all, Russia has disrupted energy supplies to Europe on six separate occasions since 2009. But progress in combatting this known threat should not undermine European energy security or worsen inflation in the United States.  LIVE UPDATES: RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE  Over the past few years, Europe has pursued an extreme and unrealistic energy agenda and attempted a radical transition to fully renewable energy, but progress has been minimal and costly.  In 2020, less than 20 percent of the European Union’s electricity came from wind and solar. Germany alone, which now experiences soaring electricity prices, has gone from an electricity exporter to an electricity importer, largely due to former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s naïve termination of her country’s nuclear power plants.  Environmental groups in Europe are responsible for these policies, which are increasingly suffocating investment into infrastructure that guarantees security from the geopolitical turmoil we see today. As a result, Europe’s energy crisis is compounded by limited infrastructure to connect natural gas receiving terminals to European consumers.  BUCK SEXTON: BIDEN'S 'HOSTILITY' TO ENERGY PRODUCTION WEAKENED US POSITION AGAINST RUSSIAN INVASION  Germany cannot greenwash its complicity in creating the current crisis. Beyond its reluctance to fully commit to NATO, former Chancellor Merkel allowed Germany to fall victim to Russian-backed ‘NGOs’ that, contrary to all factual and technical assessments, spread disinformation and stoked environmental fears over nuclear energy and U.S. produced natural gas.  The decision to sacrifice her nation’s nuclear power fleet was a baseless self-inflicted wound. Germany’s long-time embrace of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline and dependence on Russian oil and natural gas has only added to greater levels of energy insecurity.  Now Europe must face the consequences of following the advice of radical climate activists. But the reach of these consequences also extends to our borders where U.S. policymakers are pursuing similar policies that led Europe to this current energy shortage.  RUSSIAN NEWS WEBSITES HACKED PURPORTEDLY BY ANONYMOUS AMID UKRAINE INVASION  On day one, President Biden signaled the decline of America’s role as a reliable partner for Europe. He immediately rescinded authorization for the Keystone XL Pipeline and shortly afterward withdrew sanctions on Nord Stream 2.  Keystone XL was just the beginning of a disastrous trend. President Biden continues to allow and promote challenges to critical oil and natural gas infrastructure. There are still impending decisions around that corner that will either help alleviate market uncertainty in the coming months or compound the suffering of Americans and Europeans.  The Dakota Access Pipeline, a critical oil infrastructure that has operated for years, faces undue legal challenges and threats from environmental activists. Additionally, the Interior Department’s five-year offshore leasing plan – which manages plentiful offshore resources in the Gulf of Mexico – faces expiration in June of this year, and President Biden has yet to extend the development of this critical resource. Choosing not to support these projects would exacerbate our country’s reliance on Russia and other adversarial nations at a time when investing in U.S. energy security is crucial.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Oil prices have climbed above $100 per barrel, inflation stands above seven percent, and the fear of further supply disruptions have led European consumers to nervously purchase significant volumes of Russian oil – a move that only undermines the very economical costs we seek to impose on President Putin’s rogue regime. Some estimates indicate upwards of $65 billion in revenue for Russian oil giants. It is high time we recognize that pursuing policies that jeopardize domestic oil and gas production carries a very steep price for humanity.  President Biden’s accusation of potential price-gouging by U.S. producers is the opposite of domestic leadership, not to mention ignorant of the impacts of his own policies. Leadership must extend beyond words to actions. The U.S. private sector can meet rising demand, mitigate supply disruption, and provide energy security for Americans and Europeans.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  There is no doubt that climate change is a challenge to be addressed. Still, our ability to tackle its challenges requires a stable economic foundation and security of supply to provide the flexibility to implement an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy. American energy producers are the solution, not foreign adversaries.  President Biden is correct when he says "defending freedom will have costs," but those costs shouldn’t be needlessly self-inflicted.  The United States needs a renewed partnership with American energy producers, one that champions their willing contributions to economic and climate progress.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RICK PERRY

Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears called out President Biden over his energy policy on "Fox & Friends," urging him to take control of "what he has command of" in terms of American energy production. The Republican U.S. Marine veteran said the U.S. can be energy independent, but the president outsourced production in the year leading up to the crisis in Ukraine.  UKRAINE CRISIS: US MUST LEAD AGAIN ON ENERGY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE  WINSOME SEARS: We were free from depending on outside countries for our energy, and as soon as he came into office, his first day, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, killed all those jobs, and all the other jobs with it, so we can be energy independent.

Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up his nuclear threats during his war of aggression against Ukraine. His purpose is to coerce Ukraine and its many international backers to give him what he wants.  Putin has publicly directed Russian forces to alert its nuclear forces. Last week he issued a barely veiled nuclear threat when he warned that any attempt to interfere in his attack against Ukraine would lead to "consequences you have never seen."  Russian officials have made veiled nuclear threats against the U.S. and NATO in the recent past but doing so while Russia is undertaking a massive invasion of the peaceful cities of Ukraine and failing to quickly achieve the military victories that Putin seemed to have been sure of, makes his threats more significant. And the new threat of nuclear alert implies Russian nuclear weapons are more ready for timely employment.  UKRAINE HEROISM SHOULD INSPIRE US, ALLIES TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST PUTIN  This moment calls for U.S. and ally sobriety, calmness and humility. It is a mistake to brush off these threats as though we know for certain Putin is bluffing. \  Putin fundamentally distrusts the United States and our allies. It is why the Biden administration’s offers to discuss arms control and transparency measures of U.S. defensive military sites in Poland and Romania have been ignored by Putin. Such gestures do not allay Putin’s paranoia nor satisfy his genuine aims. And now, given the enormity of the pain of sanctions against Russia, it is possible Putin now believes even his rule hangs in the balance.  Putin’s recent speeches add to the long record of evidence that many Western scholars and governments have found hard to take seriously – he believes he has a right to invade sovereign nations to conquer people based on their ethnicity and traditions. It is why the Western focus on the question about further expansion of the NATO alliance misses Putin’s far more expansive and indeed imperialist aims.  This is no time to go weak-kneed and simply give in to Putin demands for fear of maximum Russian nuclear attack.  The Biden administration’s failure to appreciate Putin’s objectives to this point should spur U.S. officials to listen to the counsel of military leaders like the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, who has been warning about Russia’s nuclear weapons expansion. This is a moment to reexamine Biden officials’ assumptions about Putin, the critical role of U.S. nuclear deterrence, and to take a far more clear-eyed assessment of the risks before they respond.  This is no time to go weak-kneed and simply give in to Putin demands for fear of maximum Russian nuclear attack. This would almost guarantee further Russian aggression and communicate to other revanchist nations like China that nuclear threats work. Instead, we must focus on compelling Putin to cease his aggression and deter him from escalating the situation to the point of crossing the nuclear threshold.  Russia famously has a massive nuclear arsenal, but the type of nuclear weapons and the way Russia might employ them matter. Many Americans immediately become fearful of the notion of a Russian nuclear weapon landing in an American city. But that is not the most likely kind of nuclear threat Putin is making at this time.  Russia has invested in thousands of shorter-range and relatively lower yield nuclear weapons that are completely unbound by treaty that it could conceivably employ in theater. By threatening any kind of nuclear employment Putin might think it gives him greater leeway to pummel Ukraine at the conventional level even as it does so with greater brutality and with higher civilian casualties.  And if he begins to lose, he just might employ one of these theater nuclear weapons either in Ukraine or possibly even against a NATO ally in the hope that Ukraine will immediately beg for peace, and the U.S. and our allies would support Russia’s aims rather than retaliate with nuclear weapons and risk escalating the horrific war even further.  The United States must convince Putin that if he were to do that we would not back down and would not sue for peace. Should Putin drastically change the nature of this war, either by crossing out of the conventional domain or by threatening a NATO country with whom we have official commitments, the United States, with NATO, reserves the right and has the credible ability to retaliate in such a serious way that Putin will regret his decision.  To put a finer point on it: we have theater-range nuclear weapons too and they better believe we are ready and willing to employ them in our defense. By credibly communicating our resolve, the more likely we are to deter Putin.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  We can do that by orchestrating right now a massive U.S.-led NATO military exercises, including with nuclear delivery systems, in tandem with the issuance of official Pentagon statements that we have resolve and commitment. Additionally, Secretary of State Antony Blinken should promise to commit to further improvement and adaptation of our nuclear deterrent.  We are seeing in real time the rightful purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons – they are to deter unjust aggression against the United States’ vital interests and to preserve peace. We must make that clear.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., joined his Republican Senate colleagues in voting to block a bill to protect abortion rights as the Supreme Court reconsiders Roe v. Wade (1973) this term.  The Senate voted 46-48 on whether to bring the bill up for debate, with six senators not voting.  H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act, aims "to protect a person’s ability to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care provider’s ability to provide abortion services."  71% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: POLL  Every Senate Democrat except Manchin and Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., cosponsored the legislation. Casey voted in favor of debate on the legislation. The House voted 218-211 in favor of the bill, with every Democrat except Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, supporting it or not voting, and every Republican opposing it or not voting.  The bill stipulates that "a health care provider has a statutory right under this Act to provide abortion services, and may provide abortion services, and that provider’s patient has a corresponding right to receive such services, without" specific "limitations or requirements."  The bill would strike down any "prohibition on abortion at any point or points in time prior to fetal viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular abortion procedure." It would also invalidate any state law prohibiting "abortion after fetal viability when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health."  The bill also claims that abortion rights qualifies as "reproductive justice" seeking to address "systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism." While the bill claims that abortion restrictions "are a tool of gender oppression," it also clarifies that despite using "the terms ‘woman’ and ‘women,’" legislators intend to "protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, those who identify with a different gender, and others—who are unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion services."  PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES RIP KAMALA HARRIS' PREDICTION THAT ‘WOMEN WILL DIE’ IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED  "Sadly it looks like the Supreme Court will limit abortion rights on the coming months. That’s why the bill is essential," Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the vote. "Congress must codify into law what most Americans have long believed, that abortion is a fundamental right and that women's decisions over women's health care belong to women, not – NOT – to extremist right-wing legislatures."  "With a cascade of major crises testing our country, Senate Democrats are prioritizing a show-vote on mandating 9 months of abortion-on-demand across America," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. "Senate Democrats want to go on record supporting the radical and massively unpopular position that we should have functionally no restrictions on abortion whatsoever."  "Tonight, the hard-left formally kicked the old slogan of ‘safe, legal, and rare’ to the curb and embraced extreme pro-abortion politics," Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. "This legislation will make Planned Parenthood's army of lobbyists happy, but it's going to alienate a lot of Americans."  Polling on abortion is mixed. A Fox News Poll in Sept. 2021 found that 65% of Americans support keeping Roe v. Wade, a Knights of Columbus/Marist poll in Jan. found that most Americans (60%) would either have the Court make abortion illegal (17%) or have the issue determined by each state (44%), both positions that would involve overturning Roe.  CHRISTIANS FROM DIFFERENT RACES, DENOMINATIONS AND PARTIES GATHER TO PRAY BEFORE SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASE  The Marist poll presented six options on abortion restrictions: "abortion should be available to a woman at any time she wants one during her entire pregnancy"; "abortion should be allowed only during the first six months of a pregnancy"; "abortion should be allowed only during the first three months of a pregnancy"; "abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother"; "abortion should be allowed only to save the life of the mother"; and "abortion should never be permitted under any circumstance."  Most Americans (71%) said that abortion should be restricted to the first three months of pregnancy (22%) or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest (28%), to save the life of the mother (9%) or not at all (12%). Only 17% of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12% said it should be restricted to the first six months.  Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony List, warned that "those who sided with the abortion lobby to trample the will of the people will face political consequences." Several Democrats up for reelection in swing states voted for the bill, including Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev.  Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson called votes against the bill "unconscionable."

Heading into his first State of the Union speech, President Biden is struggling to overcome obstacles to his legislative agenda, cut back on crime, reign in rising prices for Americans and to get control of cascading international crises.  He'll also come to Congress with some significant accomplishments under his belt. Those include the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the nomination of potentially the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, and millions more American jobs than when he came into office. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases are decreasing significantly in much of the country.  "Tomorrow, the President will make a strong case that the Biden-Harris economic strategy to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out is producing historic results, and he will lay out his plan for the work ahead," a White House official told Fox News.  "He will underscore that during his first year in office, in large part due to the American Rescue Plan, entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded, and the economy achieved its fastest job growth in American history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years, and a faster recovery than every other Advanced Economy in the G7," the official added.  FOX NEWS POLL: PRESIDENT BIDEN NOT TOUGH ENOUGH ON RUSSIA  The official also said Biden will "lay out his plan to lower costs for American families while continuing an historically strong economic recovery."  Democrats say there's reason for optimism heading into the second year of Biden's presidency. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on MSNBC Sunday that although "the last two years have been nearly the toughest two years in most Americans' life… I believe even in these tough times we can see a little bit of a sense of uplift."  But for many Americans, the negatives outweigh the positives.  In a Fox News poll released last week, Biden had a 43% approval rating compared to a 56% disapproval. Fifty-one percent of Americans disapproved of Biden's COVID-19 policy, 58% disapproved of his handling of foreign policy, 61% disapproved of his handling of the economy, 59% disapproved of his handling of crime and 62% disapproved of Biden's job on immigration.  BIDEN'S ‘VICTORY’ OVER COVID IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH FROM DEFEAT  The president's speech will likely acknowledge Russia's war against Ukraine, U.S. aid to Ukraine, and the international threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden said in 2020 voters should trust him to go "toe-to-toe" with Putin. But now 56% of Americans don't think Biden's been tough enough on Putin, according to the Fox News poll.  Biden's numbers bode poorly for Democrats in the midterms. And many believe the president's unpopularity may have already helped GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin turn the state red after several years of Democrat dominance.  Domestically, the centerpiece of the president's agenda is the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The $1.2 trillion legislation resulted from months of negotiations between centrist Republicans, Democrats and the White House. The need for it was only underscored when a bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed the day Biden visited the city to make a speech touting the bill.  But the White House also expected a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill to pass as a compliment to the infrastructure bill. It was meant to encompass a grab bag of progressive policies ranging from free child care to battling climate change.  Now it's dead. After months of negotiating in the House, then in the Senate, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., finally announced he would cut off talks in a December Fox News interview.  Also dead are multiple versions of Democrat-backed election bills that Biden pushed for. Those includes the Freedom to Vote Act, John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act – which Democrats said was their top priority in 2021.  Democrats couldn't even corral full support for the For the People Act – Manchin said he opposed it. Then, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., failed in an attempt to blow up the Senate filibuster for the other two voting bills because Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Manchin opposed the move in the 50-50 split Senate.  CAPITOL DITCHES MASK REQUIREMENT AHEAD OF STATE OF THE UNION  Despite the setbacks Biden has potentially one of the biggest victories of his presidency upcoming – the likely confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.  Additionally, the White House touts decreased child poverty, the most diverse Cabinet in history, more Americans covered with health insurance and overall reduced hunger from when Biden was sworn in.

Student loan payments are delayed but aren't canceled, an effort for a bill to combat China economically is stalled, Afghanistan is under Taliban control after the deadly and disorganized American withdrawal, and inflation is increasing at a historic clip.  "With regard to inflation, hope the president doesn't just step forward with some big government solutions," Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., told Fox News. "Deficit spending to put more money in Americans' pockets will move us in the wrong direction. It's overspending that is largely to blame for inflation."

During the 2022 State of the Union address, President Biden must demonstrate the United States' "strong, unambiguous" resolve to come to the aid of Ukraine against Russia's invasion into the sovereign state, as Russian President Vladimir Putin will be looking on "closely," according to a top former Department of Defense official.  Biden is set to deliver his first State of the Union address at the Capitol Tuesday during which he is expected to highlight his administration's clean energy priorities and propose solutions to fight growing nationwide inflation.  However, the speech is likely to be overshadowed by the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Biden needs to demonstrate "resolve and commitment" during the State of the Union speech Tuesday evening in regard to standing up to Russia as its invasion continues, Dr. James Anderson told Fox News Digital in an interview Monday.  Anderson, who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for policy at the Department of Defense (DOD) under the former President Trump administration, led the formulation and coordination of national security policy within DOD.  The defense expert told Fox News Digital that it is imperative that Biden, during his speech, "clarify what is at stake" to the American people and the world, in part, because all eyes will be on the president, including Putin himself.  This is a "big moment" for the United States, as Putin will be looking "closely" at what Biden says during his speech, Anderson explained.  In addition, the former undersecretary said that Biden must encourage Europe to "continue to step up" to assist Ukraine.  STATE OF THE UNION 2022: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW  When asked about what more the U.S. could do to force Putin out of Ukraine, Anderson said that Biden must lead the country in providing support, including lethal weapons, to Ukraine's military.  Beyond sanctions, the U.S. must "show that is it going to lead the effort to make sure the Ukrainian military gets what it needs to expel Russian forces," he told Fox News Digital.  There are a variety of land routes into Ukraine and ways for the U.S. to get materials into the country and increase the supply routes, according to Anderson.

The International Criminal Court has started investigating Russia over potential war crimes the country may have committed during its invasion of Ukraine, after a Ukrainian official claimed that Russia used an illegal weapon during the war, officials said.  On Monday, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the former country used a vacuum bomb, in violation of international law, Reuters reported.  PUTIN'S 40 MILES OF KILLING MACHINES TAUNT UKRAINE'S CAPITAL: LIVE UPDATES  "They used the vacuum bomb today," Markarova said outside a closed congressional hearing where committee members received an intelligence briefing on the war. "The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."  That same day, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, who was already investigating ahead of the invasion, said he was opening an investigation "as rapidly as possible" into any other potential violations, ABC News reported.  TRUMP WARNS 'WORLD WAR' COULD BE NEXT AS RUSSIA CONTINUES INVASION IN UKRAINE  A vacuum bomb is a thermobaric weapon that is typically more devastating than traditional bombs as it absorbs the oxygen in a given space to cause a significant blast capable of vaporizing humans, Reuters reported.  A Russian vehicle capable of carrying thermobaric weaponry was spotted traveling in Ukraine, CNN reported, but there is no official determination that such a weapon was used.

The media have made a stunning series of miscalculations when it comes to what is now a global conflict in Ukraine.  Most journalists have underestimated the fiercely independent Ukrainian people, who have bravely fought back against the Russians (who have their vastly superior firepower), held the capital and slowed the military advance.  The media have underestimated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a former comedian with no political experience, who has inspired the world by taking to the streets in military garb, rejecting a U.S. evacuation offer and making videos vowing to resist.  They have underestimated the impact of Western sanctions, which have shut down the Russian stock market, collapsed the ruble, cut off many of the country’s banks from the credit markets and sent untold numbers racing to their ATM machines.  BIDEN SLAMS RUSSIA AS INVASION REVEALS PUTIN'S LITANY OF LIES  They have underestimated our NATO allies, some of whom have been tougher than us in sanctioning Vladimir Putin personally and partially closing off the SWIFT financial system, prompting the Biden administration to play catchup. They have also led the way in closing their airspace to Russian airplanes, with even such normally neutral nations as Japan, Finland and Sweden standing with Ukraine. But Joe Biden deserves some credit as well for laying the diplomatic groundwork for a more unified alliance.  On the other side of the equation, there was a minority in the media as well as politics who said the press drumbeat about an invasion was hype, that Putin wouldn’t take such a risky step, that this was all designed as a distraction from Biden’s political woes. Columnist Matt Taibbi deserves credit for apologizing for his misjudgment on the invasion itself.  TRUMP, ALLIES DEFEND OR DEFLECT PUTIN'S INVASION; WAS ROMNEY RIGHT?  An overlapping group said that Ukraine is irrelevant to our national security, that most Americans don’t care, and that Biden should worry more about our southern border than the Ukrainian border. Some are changing their tune as the casualty count rises and Russia, despite its pledge to limit civilian casualties, has bombed apartment buildings. And with more than 500,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine, this is clearly a problem for the world community.  Over the longer term, virtually the entire media community owes Mitt Romney an apology for mocking and denigrating him for arguing in the 2012 campaign that Russia was our No. 1 geopolitical foe. The New York Times said the observation, which Barack Obama exploited, showed Romney was unfit for the White House. CNN and the Atlantic are among the media outlets that now say Romney was right. Over the weekend, the Utah senator called pro-Putin Republicans "almost treasonous."  Some of the reaction to the Ukraine catastrophe has obviously been filtered through domestic politics. Few Republicans spoke out when Donald Trump called Putin "savvy" and a "genius," and branded our own leaders "dumb," and while Trump called the invasion "appalling" over the weekend, he refrained from directly criticizing the Russian autocrat.  SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES  Trump said in a statement yesterday that he "got delinquent NATO members to start paying their dues…hundreds of billions of dollars. There would be no NATO if I didn’t act strongly and swiftly." The former president did press some members to boost their contributions, but he also questioned the need for the alliance and the likes of John Kelly and John Bolton have said he tried to pull away from NATO.  As for Biden, there is legitimate media criticism that he could have been even more aggressive in opposing Putin. But as Fox’s Jennifer Griffin told me on "Media Buzz," had the president sent troops to Ukraine’s border, he would have given Putin a pretext to launch the invasion and blame America.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Despite the heroic efforts of the Ukrainians and the mounting western sanctions that are themselves a form of war, we don’t know how this Russian invasion will turn out. What we do know–thanks in part to courageous journalists covering the conflict–is that the world looks very different today than it did one week ago.

Facing multiple primary challengers from the right as he runs for re-election, GOP Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas is showing off his conservative credentials.  "We are not going to allow these big-government socialists to destroy the state of Texas," Abbott recently declared on the campaign trail as he bids for a third four-year term steering the nation’s second-most populous and largest state.  And taking aim at President Biden and his administration over the combustible issue of border security, Abbott emphasized to supporters at a burger joint in San Antonio two weeks ago that "the great state of Texas will step up and do the government's job... Texas is now building our own border wall."  TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT TAKES AIM AT PRESIDENT BIDEN OVER RISING FUEL PRICES  Abbott’s also showcased his conservative record on abortion restrictions, crime, election integrity and other issues that along with border security are top of mind with GOP voters. And the governor's reminded primary voters that he’s backed by former President Trump as he crisscrossed the state on an extensive campaign swing that wrapped up Monday evening in San Antonio, on the eve of the Texas primary.  The governor's facing a field of seven Republican challengers, including former Texas GOP chair Allen West, a former congressman from Florida, former state Sen. Don Huffines, and conservative commentator Chad Prather.  As Fox News first reported last month, border security was front and center in the governor’s closing primary campaign TV commercial.  TEXAS GOVERNORS RACE: ABBOTT, O'ROURKE, HAUL IN BIG BUCKS  "Gov. Abbott deployed the National Guard to assist law enforcement at the border. He’s given us new authority to arrest trespassers and has increased jail capacity to handle criminal arrests. Joe Biden should be securing this border, but he won’t," Sheriff Ray Del Bosque of Zapata County, which sits along the U.S.-Mexico border south of Laredo, says in the ad.  "That’s why Gov. Abbott is getting the job done," Sheriff Bill Waybourn of Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth, emphasizes at the end of the spot.  The governor’s praised Operation Lone Star, the effort he launched early last year amid a surge of undocumented migrants at the nation’s southern border to increase apprehensions of alleged criminals and seizure of illegal drugs.  THE FOX NEWS 2022 ELECTIONS POWER RANKINGS  But there’s been criticism of the mission from both Democrats and Republicans amid reports of suicides, poor working conditions, mismanagement and pay issues among the Texas National Guard troops sent to the border as part of the effort. And West and Huffines have repeatedly blasted Abbott over his border mission as they take aim at the conservative governor from the right.  Besides border security, the governor's GOP challengers have questioned Abbott's conservative credentials on other key issues. Among them, they've targeted the governor over his statewide mask mandate as the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation two years ago – although Abbott was one of the first governors to drop the restrictions. And they've argued the governor's not been forceful enough in outlawing gender-affirming care for transgender children.  But most polling suggests Abbott with a large lead over his challengers and in the driver’s seat to top 50% of the primary vote and avoid a runoff.  BETO O'ROURKE JUMPS INTO TEXAS GUBERNATORIAL RACE  That would set him up November against all-but-certain Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke. The former congressman from El Paso – who came close to ousting Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 Senate election before unsuccessfully running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination -- faces nominal opposition in the Democratic primary.  Longtime Texas-based Republican strategist Brendan Steinhauser noted that "Abbott's massive war chest, high name ID, and high approval ratings will make it difficult" for his rivals "to pull off the upset win."  And veteran Texas-based GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak said that Abbott "hasn’t had to play any defense. He’s done everything right, and he’s kept his focus on Beto, and the fact that he’s been able to do that should tell you a lot about where that primary race is."

Sean Penn said he "walked miles" to the border of Poland on Monday from Ukraine, where he has been filming a documentary about Russia's invasion.  The actor took to Twitter to share an update just days after it was revealed he was in Kyiv to film a documentary about the escalating conflict.  "Myself & two colleagues walked miles to the Polish border after abandoning our car on the side of the road," Penn revealed in his tweet on Monday.  "Almost all the cars in this photo carry women & children only, most without any sign of luggage, and a car their only possession of value," he added.  PUTIN'S 40 MILES OF KILLING MACHINES TAUNT UKRAINE'S CAPITAL: LIVE UPDATES  A representative for the actor did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request on Tuesday for an update on his current location.  Over the weekend, the 61-year-old condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin and applauded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his response to the conflict.  "Already a brutal mistake of lives taken and hearts broken, and if he doesn’t relent, I believe Mr. Putin will have made a most horrible mistake for all of humankind," Penn said in the statement, which he later shared to Twitter.  SEAN PENN ARRIVES IN UKRAINE TO FILM DOCUMENTARY ON RUSSIAN INVASION  The "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" actor went on to praise the people of Ukraine and their leader for their bravery.  "President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have risen as historic symbols of courage and principle," he wrote. "Ukraine is the tip of the spear for the democratic embrace of dreams. If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost."  Penn arrived in Kyiv last week to film a documentary about the crisis.  "American actor and film director, Oscar winner Sean Penn arrived in Ukraine," a translated statement from the Office of the President of Ukraine’s Facebook page stated. "The director came to Kyiv specifically to record all the events taking place in Ukraine as a documentary filmmaker and to tell the world the truth about Russia's invasion of our country."  "Today, Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine," the statement added. "Our country is grateful to him for such a display of courage and honesty. This morning, the director visited the office of the president and attended a press briefing by Iryna Vereshchuk, adviser to the head of the office of the head of state and vice prime minister - minister for reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. He talked to journalists, to our military, saw how we defend our country.  A LOOK AT UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY’S ACTING CAREER BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS  "Sean Penn demonstrates the courage that many others, including Western politicians, lack. The more such people in our country now, true friends of Ukraine, who support the struggle for freedom, the sooner it will be possible to stop Russia's treacherous attack."  "The director has already arrived in Ukraine in November 2021," the statement concluded.

Nearly half of the 500 million free COVID-19 tests the Biden administration recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test.  Wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic, from vaccines to hand sanitizer, along with tests. On the first day of the White House test giveaway in January, COVIDtests.gov received over 45 million orders. Now officials say fewer than 100,000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household, delivered by the U.S. Postal Service.  Still, the White House sees the program as a step toward a deeper, yet more elastic, testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane. "We totally intend to sustain this market," Dr. Tom Inglesby, testing adviser to the COVID-19 response team, told The Associated Press. "We know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants."  The White House says Americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests, which leaves about 46% of the stock of tests still available to be ordered.  WHITE HOUSE DROPPING MASK MANDATE BEFORE BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION: OFFICIAL  Testing will become more important with mask requirements now easing, say some independent experts. "If infection control is still our priority, testing is central," said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic. "Four tests per household for one family will only last you one time. There should be enough tests for families to test twice a week."  Inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that.  Private insurers are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person, per month. Medicare coverage will start in the spring. The administration has also been making free at-home tests available through libraries, clinics and other community venues. Capacity for the more accurate PCR tests performed by labs has been built up. The White House recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year.  Wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often. "Right now it is still unclear," she said.  President Joe Biden’s pivot to testing came under duress as the omicron variant gained force just before Christmas. Tests were frustratingly hard to come by, and expensive. The White House is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late.  "There is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected," said Tim Manning, supply coordinator for the COVID-19 response team.  Around mid-December, with omicron projections grimmer by the day, White House officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one. But if the government started siphoning up tests on the market, that would just make the shortage worse.  "A critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public," Manning said.  The White House enlisted the Pentagon and parts of the Health and Human Services Department that had worked on the Trump administration’s vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines. Logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests. The Postal Service was designated to take the orders and deliver them.  HONG KONG ORDERS MANDATORY COVID-19 TESTS FOR ALL RESIDENTS  That part proved to be a good call, said Hana Schank, an expert on government technology projects with the New America think-tank. The Postal Service already had a database of every address in the land, and the means to deliver.  "At the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the Post Office," she said.  The project took less than a month to get ready, Manning said. "We said this is not online retail," he said. "This is emergency response, so we have go to as fast as possible."  To make sure it wasn’t just the tech savvy who would end up getting free tests, the administration targeted a share of deliveries to people in low-income areas. The White House worked with service organizations to get the word out.  "We prioritized the processing of orders to the highest social vulnerability zip codes in the country," testing adviser Inglesby said.  One of the service groups was the National Association of Community Health Workers, whose members help people navigate the health care system. Executive director Denise Smith said the group was able to use its website to link more than 630,000 people to COVIDtests.gov.  Overall about 20% to 25% of the tests have gone to people in distressed areas, officials said.  Now that demand is way down, it’s unclear what will happen to the White House giveaway program. Allowing repeat orders is one possibility.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Smith says groups like hers should get any surplus. "We know where the people are," she said.  Although the program is still in its infancy, analyst Lindsey Dawson of the Kaiser Family Foundation believes its legacy may lie in familiarizing more people with testing. "It may get someone comfortable with utilizing the tests, thinking about how they might use testing in their lives," she said.  Savita Sharaf, a retiree from the Maryland suburbs outside the nation’s capital, said she ordered her free tests around the middle of January and got them in early February. She’s tried to conserve them, for added peace of mind. In the stores, she couldn’t find tests for less than $25.  "I’m so relieved because I can immediately test myself," Sharaf said. "If we had a high vaccination rate, it would be a little easier to say let up on this program. But I feel we have to watch for the next month or two, to see what happens."

Sean Hannity blasted Joe Biden's leadership and the Russian military's indiscriminate attacks against Ukraine, including one that left a six-year-old girl dead Monday on "Hannity."  Hannity called on the Russian Army – the participation in which is compulsory under Kremlin law – to turn its weapons on its authoritarian commander-in-chief, Vladimir Putin.  Putin, recently saber-rattled a potential nuclear threat when he announced the elevation of a warning level among the country's nuclear defense contingent.  "All eyes are on Ukraine as a bloody new chapter of war appears to be unfolding right before our very eyes now," Hannity said. "Civilians are directly in Russia's crosshairs now."  Citing a video of a young Ukrainian girl laying lifeless on an O.R. table, Hannity issued a message to the troops under 69-year-old authoritarian's command:  "Her blood is on Vladimir Putin's hands. So my question to the Russian soldiers tonight, following Putin's orders and waging this war on civilians and even children -- is this the legacy you want for your life? Is this worth it?"  "Do you have the courage to stand up against this naked aggression against innocent men, women and children?"  "Vladimir Putin killed that six-year-old girl. Vladimir Putin started this war. Vladimir Putin is a murdering thug who is willing to kill even children to satisfy his maniacal territorial ambitions," Hannity said.  Hannity called the Russian president a "murdering tyrant" and said Russian soldiers should be absolved from taking orders from him for that reason.  Hannity urged the Russian military to remove Putin from power, by force if necessary:  "The Russian military will hear about shows like this. They need to stop taking orders from this murderer. They need to take him out," he said.  "The world needs to agree that Putin should no longer be running Russia. He's a murdering, authoritarian thug -- Killing innocent civilians and civilized countries need to agree that he must be removed sooner than later and by whatever means necessary."  Pivoting to former President Donald Trump's condemnation of the Russian invasion as a "travesty" and "assault on humanity," Hannity said the real estate mogul struck the right chord when he characterized Biden as weak and not respected by other world leaders.

"The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course, he's smart. But the real problem is that our leaders are dumb, and they so far allowed him to get away with this travesty."  "Now, of course, President Trump is right. The Western world is being stupid. We need to understand this thug for who he is. We need to understand that the only thing that works is strength," he said.  "Putin probably feared Donald Trump. Putin knew that with Trump, if he said it, he meant it [and] he'd do it. Weakness invites chaos. It invites carnage."

We have ratcheted back on American energy production and become much more reliant upon Russian oil, as well as reentering the Iran JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, where we're allowing Russians to barter that deal, which would allow Iran to get back into the energy market. All of this is ludicrous.

There are those that will disagree with that, but it is the one thing that would really ratchet down on President Putin, and that is his energy revenues. … Energy security is national security, we should be ramping it up here, and ratcheting down on President Putin and Russia, and yet this administration refuses to do that.

This gives borrowers just two months to start preparing their finances after two years of federal forbearance.  Democrats have warned President Joe Biden that resuming payments without student loan cancelation would be "disastrous" ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. And although polling data suggests that most Americans want the student loan payment pause extended through the end of the year, the Biden administration has not announced plans to extend forbearance again.  Keep reading to learn how to prepare for federal student loan repayment, including income-driven repayment, additional federal deferment and student loan refinancing.

STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT PAUSE HAS COST THE GOVERNMENT $100B  How to prepare for the end of student loan forbearance  Federal borrowers will be expected to resume making payments on their student loan debt in just two short months. Missed payments may be reported to the major credit bureaus, which can ding your credit score. Extended periods of delinquency make you ineligible for federal benefits like deferment or forbearance, and may eventually result in wage garnishment.  If you're not ready to resume federal student loan payments, here's how you can start preparing now:  Check your loan repayment terms. Visit the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website to see your remaining loan balance, monthly payment amount and your payment due date.

POLL: AMERICANS DOUBTFUL THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL CANCEL STUDENT LOANS IN 2022  Private lenders may offer more competitive student loan rates  Among all existing student loan borrowers, the average interest rate is 5.8%, according to the Education Data Initiative. The interest rate you pay depends on the type of student loans you have, such as Direct Program Loans or Parent PLUS Loans. These are the average federal interest rates by loan type between 2006 and 2022, per Credible data:  Undergraduate Direct Loans: 4.60%  Graduate Direct Loans: 6.16%  Direct PLUS Loans: 7.20%  In comparison, well-qualified borrowers who refinanced their student loans on Credible during the week of Feb. 14 saw average rates of 3.75% for 10-year fixed-rate loans and 3.10% for 5-year variable-rate loans.  While federal student loan rates are based on when you originated the loan, private student loan rates tend to vary by credit score and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Borrowers with fair or bad credit may consider enlisting the help of a creditworthy cosigner to increase their chances of getting a low rate.  Student loan refinancing has the potential to save borrowers thousands of dollars over time, but it may not be the right move for everyone. If you plan on applying for student loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), then refinancing to a private student loan would make you ineligible.  Borrowers who don't plan on utilizing federal student loan benefits may consider student loan refinancing while rates are low. Refinancing your student loan debt at a lower interest rate may help you reduce your monthly payments, pay off debt years faster and save money over the life of the loan.  As an added benefit, private student loan lenders are prohibited from charging refinancing fees. The interest rate you pay represents the total cost of borrowing the loan. A student loan refinance calculator can help you decide if this financial strategy is right for you.  You can browse current student loan refinancing rates across multiple online lenders in the table below. Then, you can visit Credible to see your estimated rate with a soft credit check, which won't harm your credit score.

Several years ago I wrote about the "cycle of worry" in my book, "False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear."  The term means that whatever anxiety-provoking obsessive mindset you are stuck inside, it tends to perpetuate itself, built up by lack of sleep, lack of exercise, loss of diversionary activity, increased alcohol use, etc.  It doesn’t matter – in terms of what you are feeling – whether the cycle of worry comes from excess fear of catching a virus or fear of an evolving war, as Dr. Judson Brewer, author of the important book "Unwinding Anxiety: New Science Shows How to Break the Cycles of Worry and Fear to Heal Your Mind," said to me on Doctor Radio Reports on SiriusXm this week.  BIDEN'S ‘VICTORY’ OVER COVID IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH FROM DEFEAT  And, Dr. Brewer added, it doesn’t matter whether this anxiety is something you personally experience or something stoked by social media, although clearly voyeuristic images of a war-torn country don’t have the same power as actually being there.  Anxiety is anxiety and is bad for your health no matter where it originates.  And one cycle of worry can quickly be replaced by another, in this case COVID fears are replaced by fear of war. The world is a small place on the internet and social media and too many of us plug ourselves into events in the news and feel like it is happening to us.  I agree with Dr. Brewer. The hard-wiring of the human brain, which runs through the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex and, once triggered, leads to an outpouring of stress hormones, is far more powerful than anything we can do to try to reason around it. Instead, the cure for our cycles of worry lies in more positive replacement feelings and desensitizing ourselves to our worries by "getting back on the bike’’ once we have fallen off.  When it comes to fear, it is helpful to have leaders we can admire and emulate who aren’t projecting that worry themselves.  This treatment is just as useful for fear of war as it is for fear of COVID. Too many people are afraid to go to restaurants or the movies even after the mask requirements have been removed, and the numbers of cases have dropped dramatically.  While I applaud the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for shifting its focus to community prevalence and hospital capacity rather than case positivity rates, I think it took them far too long to get there. Overloaded hospitals interfere with health care delivery of all kinds, beyond just COVID.  The new message of liberation from excess masking and mandates is welcome but overdue. Vaccines and boosters should always have been recommended as a way to be liberated from severe COVID risk rather than as something forced. As a society, we have worn the yoke of COVID fear for too long, and it has scarred us.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  When it comes to fear, it is helpful to have leaders we can admire and emulate who aren’t projecting that worry themselves.  Right now there is no one better to look to than Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who, while dressed in a flak jacket, responded to the U.S. offer to airlift him out of the combat zone in Kyiv with the already famous words, "I need ammunition, not a ride." This ironic response from the former comedian sends a message of hope and courage to overcome the fear. Accused of being a Nazi by Putin, Zelenskyy, a Jew who lost three great uncles in the Holocaust, was cool and projected courage and calm. "How can I be a Nazi?" he said.  And now that Putin has raised his nuclear status to "special combat readiness," the fear level is even higher, and those of us who grew up during the heart of the Cold War, with practice drills spent hiding under our desks at school, feel extra shocks of fear and worry.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  But keep in mind that courage, love and laughter course through the same centers of the brain as worry and anxiety. It is impossible to feel both at the same time.  The world is coming together around the Ukrainian leader. He reminds us of this message we need to live by: If Putin’s fear and intimidation tactics aren’t working against Zelenskyy, whose country is being invaded and whose life is menaced, then these awful emotions don’t have to work against anyone.

The Kremlin’s authoritarian assembled a massive force, seeded the pretext for an attack, and entered Ukraine promising to demilitarize and de-nazify it; a great performance right out of Soviet Joseph Stalin’s playbook. Then Putin warned the West not to threaten him because you "should know that Russia’s response will follow without delay and entail consequences [perhaps nuclear] that you have never encountered in your history."  Putin’s warning upped the ante on Sunday when he directed Russian nuclear forces to high alert, what he labeled "special regime of combat duty," a move that could boil into a nuclear war. The Russian authoritarian attributed the escalation to "aggressive statements regarding our country" by NATO powers and the West’s hard-hitting financial sanctions against Moscow and individual Russians like himself.  RUSSIA VS UKRAINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA – ZELENSKYY AND HIS PEOPLE WINNING ON THAT FRONT  The Ukraine invasion is a wake-up call of a coming new world order, especially Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling. Unfortunately, our political class seems clueless about Putin’s assault into Ukraine and especially the carnage piling high in the streets of Kyiv.  Yes, Putin will likely succeed in taking that country no matter the cost because he has overwhelming military capabilities and the mostly risk-adverse West is unlikely to help because Putin would cut off their gas or heaven help us, launch a nuclear-tipped Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile, or any number of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles like the Iskander in Russia’s Baltic enclave Kaliningrad. Meanwhile, if further escalation fails for now, Putin will then, in his own time, make every effort to recapture the remnants of the old Warsaw Pact countries, beginning with the Baltics.  Anyone with an understanding of world history and a pulse on current geopolitics knew this was coming.  It’s simple. The war in Ukraine wouldn’t be if Putin didn’t have his comrade Chinese President Xi Jinping’s tacit approval. Remember they met Feb. 4, 2022, in the shadow of the Beijing Olympics and signed a joint communique pledging mutual support, what some now call a new authoritarian alliance, echoes of the World War II Axis Powers. Both tyrants have had enough of the lopsided pro-West world order, those liberal values and institutions. They are taking a wrecking ball to that order to create one to their liking.  This fits the Chinese ambitions. The Middle Kingdom dates back 3,500 years, ruled until the early 20th century by 15 dynasties. Since 1949, after a vicious civil war and occupation by the Japanese, the communists brought Leninism to that massive population. They constantly remind themselves of past humiliations at the hand of 19th-century Europeans, but welcomed Richard Nixon in 1972 and the global community of nations. Bill Clinton then gave them membership in the World Trade Organization, an act that brought China into great wealth. Now, the regime is returning to its roots, like Putin: out with the liberal order and in with an authoritarian order in its image.  Both Putin and Xi are like Hitler in that they are resentful of the West and are ambitious.  Communist leader Xi Jinping is much like Putin. The chairman rejects most everything western: he disregards our laws, manipulates our elections, robs our corporations of their intellectual property, steals what he can’t buy, and threatens or kills those at home who fail to abide by his regime’s mandates. He’s perhaps worse than even Mao Zedong, who reportedly killed 45 million Chinese.  We need to understand these men, especially something about their history.  Putin’s use of Russian imperial imagery in his speeches suggests that he intends to go beyond the Soviet Union to restore the empire. Keep in mind that in 1989 Putin was a KGB agent in East Germany when the Soviet Union collapsed, and then the U.S. declared itself the Cold War "winner" and set up a unipolar world. That transition ignored the Russians who felt humiliated by the West, and as a result a deep-seated cultural "resentment" metastasized.  There is a historic precedent, a lesson that was evidently ignored by the West. World War I ended with the Versailles Treaty that humiliated the defeated Germans. The treaty forced Germany to accept the war guilt clause and total responsibility for the war, as well as pay the allies reparations, and it gutted the proud Wehrmacht (German army). That humiliation led to World War II.  The German people were distraught after that war and their economy was in the tank. They were ripe for help but none came from the allies. So, a nationalist rose from the ashes, Adolf Hitler, who plugged into hyper-nationalism, quickly rebuilt the nation’s economy and military, and then turned its newfound might and a stomach full of humiliation on the rest of Europe.  Both Putin and Xi are like Hitler in that they are resentful of the West and are ambitious. They are tapping into nationalism to resurrect their countries’ former greatness. The difference now vs. pre-World War II is that Moscow and Beijing together have lots of energy, people, technology and money. Together, they can rip up the old and put in place a world order in their authoritarian image.  Where does that leave the West?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The West must seek a way to reduce tensions and especially the possibility of a nuclear exchange. However, it’s clear our world order is shifting, which means the West must take at least three significant steps while being alert for further developments.  First, in World War II the United States was the arsenal of democracy. It can once again fill that role, not necessarily with just tanks and airplanes, but by producing energy. Europe needs a steady source of energy to escape Putin’s stranglehold. China, in particular, is very vulnerable to energy issues, as well as food.  Second, recognize Putin and Xi are fundamentally opposed to the principles of the West. This is about a civilizational struggle, something similar to Sam Huntington’s "Clash of Civilizations." It’s not about ideology but opposing world views – liberal versus authoritarian values. The West must aggressively oppose Russian and Chinese maligned behavior and punish their consistent violations.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Finally, the U.S., in concert with NATO, will need to move additional military assets back to Europe, particularly Poland, Romania and the Baltics. Both Putin and Xi must understand the U.S. and its allies are resolved to counter this attack on global order. We must also build up in Asia to firmly oppose any adventurist ambitions by the Chinese.  The evil alliance of Putin and Xi will try to destroy our liberal world order and turn it into one governed by authoritarians that seize sovereign nations like Ukraine or Taiwan at will and impose their draconian ways, robbing us of all our liberties.

A mother’s love can’t be stopped, even when you’re at work.  That’s what multimedia journalist Myles Harris learned firsthand while he was on location for a story in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this week.  Standing across the street from a Roosters Wings restaurant on East Dublin-Granville Road while wearing his blue jacket from ABC 6, Harris tried to coordinate his shot with his videographer DeAngelo Byrd.  WEST VIRGINIA REPORTER HIT BY CAR WHILE ON AIR -- CONTINUES REPORTING  Harris’ mother, Sandi, slowly rolled up behind him in her car and stopped by to say hi, according to a video the local news reporter shared to Instagram on Sunday, Feb. 20.  "This is my mom, hold on," Harris tells his crew near the start of the 21-second clip.  Once Sandi is sure she has his attention after she stops her car, she calls out, "Hi baby!"  "I’m trying to work right now, and you’re over there calling my phone," Harris responds in acknowledgment that he notice her earlier.  "This is DeAngelo. You can say, ‘Hi.’" He continues. "And don’t be holding up traffic because you got cars behind you."  "Oh, alright," Sandi says before she blows a kiss and drives away.

The Sinclair Broadcast Group operates both stations to serve residents in northeast Columbus. Harris was actively reporting for ABC 6 when his mother stopped to greet him in the field.

"There are legal issues we have to go through and then we see what comes out," team principal Gunther Steiner told Sky Sports.  Haas was last among Formula One constructors in 2021 as it chose to reduce its investment ahead of the all-new car being launched this season, and Mazepin finished behind his teammate Mick Schumacher 11 of 14 times they both completed a race.  If he needs to be dropped as a result of his relationship to Uralkali, Mazepin set to be replaced initially by the team's reserve driver, Pietro Fittipaldi, grandson of two-time Formula One champion Emerson Fittipaldi.  "If Nikita couldn’t drive for one or another reason, the first call would go to Pietro," Steiner told Speed City Broadcasting.  Every F1 team has one or more reserve drivers on call in case something happens to their primary drivers. Fittipaldi has already raced twice for Haas in 2020 after then-team member Romain Grosjean was injured in a crash.  "Obviously, [Pietro has been] with us for a few years, and then we would see what we do next."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Competing in Formula One requires an FIA Super License, which is based on experience and performance in other racing leagues, and the list of eligible drivers is relatively short.  In fact, even as he is on Haas, Schumacher serves as one of the Ferrari F1 team's reserve drivers, and could potentially get called up by the Italian team for one or more races this season, which would also open a seat at Haas for Fittipaldi.  The Formula One season is scheduled to begin on March 20 in Bahrain.

Russia could launch more indiscriminate attacks against Ukrainians because of its failure to quickly seize the capital, a retired Navy captain and former intelligence officer told Fox News.  WATCH:  "Because they haven't been as successful as they expected, I think we might unfortunately see the Russian forces behave a little more indiscriminately," said Steven Horrell, who's now a nonresident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis. "This will start to turn into even more of a humanitarian crisis."  Monday marked the fifth day since Russia invaded Ukraine.  Western intelligence estimated Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, could have fallen into Russian control within a matter of days. But the Ukrainians, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have resisted Russian advances and maintained control of much of the country, including Kyiv.  RUSSIA, UKRAINE TALKS CONCLUDE, MASSIVE EXPLOSION ROCKS KYIV: LIVE UPDATES  "There is more of an expectation of weakness on the part of Zelenskyy and other leaders," Horrell said. The Russians "might have believed some of their own press releases about a lack of a Ukrainian national identity."  "Those have all proven false," he continued. "The Ukrainian people have rallied, and Zelenskyy has shown great leadership."  KREMLIN SENDS 400 RUSSIAN MERCENARIES INTO KYIV ON MISSION TO ASSASSINATE ZELENSKYY: REPORT  But Russia still holds the upper hand, according to Horrell.  "There still is a capability advantage to the Russians," he said. "I think the overall objective is to … take the capital, decapitate Ukraine and install a friendly government rather than to get bogged down and try and occupy territory for years and years."  Russian President Vladimir Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on heightened alert over the weekend.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Horrell told Fox News that Putin’s "nuclear machismo" is a dangerous path for him to take, but that the "world condemnation" of the announcement was the appropriate response.  Putin has also expressed aspirations to bring other former Soviet states into the Russian sphere of influence, including Georgia. Horrell told Fox News that Putin may think twice about engaging in any operations to overtake other sovereign states given the challenge his forces have faced in Ukraine.  "Certainly any strategic operational level calculus has to be changing with the lack of success in the first five days," Horrell said.

Thousands of protesters supporting Ukraine marched to the White House on Sunday and demanded the U.S. take additional steps to help Ukraine following last week's Russian invasion.  "First of all, I would like that all the civilized countries unite and cut Russia from Swift," Yana Maksymova told Fox News. Secondly, "help close the sky" and thirdly, "spread the word because this is just the beginning of World War III, and we don't want this to happen."  Others echoed Makysmova, pleading for the U.S. to "close the sky," to provide humanitarian and military help, and for a total Russian "blockade."  WATCH:  The Biden administration announced Monday that it was immediately blocking financial transactions of Russian central bank assets. The sanction effectively freezes any of those assets held by Americans.  The move follows numerous other sanctions the Biden administration imposed last week targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, other members of Russia's security council, Russian banks, financial institutions and elites.  RUSSIA, UKRAINE MEETS FOR TALKS; RUSSIA SHELLS UKRAINE'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY: LIVE UPDATES  But protesters, many of whom had family in Ukraine, felt President Biden's actions were not enough.  "It's a fight of evil versus the good, and sanctions is not enough to protect the good," one protester told Fox News.  Ukraine needs help "to fight the most aggressive country in the world," another Ukrainian-American said.  Many supporters told Fox News they worried for the safety of their families.

"We just want people to know what's going on, to help us, to protect our families."  Andrew Yakymenko, a Ukranian-American, said his family is "hiding in bunkers. They are bombing the city, kids, everybody."

From the South Side of Chicago, Pastor Corey Brooks has watched Americans debate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and what it means. On the 99th day of his 100-day rooftop vigil to build a community center, he wished to share his unique views with his audience.  What follows has been lightly edited. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear the pastor in his own words.  Like most Americans, I've been watching the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold in real time. For me, there's a sense that we knew this was going to come, that this was going to happen. Some of us may not believe it's actually happening, but we cannot deny that we knew it was coming.  When I see wrongs like this I often try to think of it in universal terms. Why did this happen?  The short answer is because we let it happen.  We had countless people warn us about Russia's ambitions and Putin's character. People like Senator Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain, various Eastern European leaders. They all warned us and we ignored them. Even President Biden admitted he knew it was going to happen.  We said nothing when President Obama allowed Putin to take Crimea. Now with President Biden, we hear a lot of tough talk backed by weak action.  ROOFTOP REVELATIONS: EMPLOYMENT AND SECURITY ARE KEY TO UPLIFTING NEIGHBORHOODS  You are witnessing how ineffective, unwilling, and weak our government has become. We say, "We want peace, but we never do what is necessary to achieve peace." We say, "We want peace and we want to get rid of the violence," and when the violence happens, we say, "Aw shucks, this really saddens me. It hurts me."  From where I sit on the South Side of Chicago, I cannot help but think that this is a profound American flaw. I know most of you, if not all of you, to be honest, are not expecting words on foreign policy from a pastor like me. But the reason why I've been doing "Rooftop Revelations" is to offer our unique perspective from the South Side of Chicago. Words that have never been heard or things that have never been seen coming from the South Side. So take it for what it's worth.  The reason why the American government's response to Ukraine bothers me is because it sounds similar to the government's response to our neighborhood. The government has not interfered in the lives of America as much as it has with black communities and native Americans. People in these poor communities have been crying for help for years. More police, more security, more schools, better roads, we have been calling for them. We've needed them to achieve peace, but when we've called, we’ve gotten no response. We see 40 people shot and five killed on weekends, and when it happens, we hear them say, "Oh, this saddens me." And nothing gets done that shifts the needle toward peace.  Now, understand we're not asking the government to save us. We work every day to build up our communities, but we need outside help since the problems here are so dire. Just like the Ukrainians need outside help, we do too.  My point here is that we have allowed ourselves to be accustomed to saying sweet nothings about peace, and we end up saying, "This saddens me. This hurts me."  That's what we're saying as we watch the Ukrainians have their lives turned upside down. What is also fascinating is how NATO has also failed here. You know what that reminds me of? Black Lives Matter. Americans gave millions upon millions to Black Lives Matter believing that they would help communities like ours. Ukraine gave up their nukes to move toward democracy and what is NATO doing?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  What I'm getting at is we're seeing how governments are failing. We Americans have lost the concept of evil. We truly have. We no longer talk about the devil. There is evil. I see it every day on the streets. They shoot, they loot, they kill. Then our government lets them back on the streets to kill again. And we say, "This saddens me. This hurts me."  But you want to know who lets this happen? We the People. We have given too much power to our governments, far too much power. We expect them to take care of us. The Ukrainians gave up their nukes when the Soviet collapsed because our government promised to defend them.  How is that working out?  Look at how our government drove down neighborhoods like mine, drove them down into the ground. They pour millions into these communities, promising to uplift. Instead they create a culture of dependency. Maybe that's what they want: all of us to be dependent upon them. But all that does is lead to violence and politicians biting their lips and saying, "This saddens me. This hurts me."  I say to the American people, enough is enough. This is why I'm here on this South Side of Chicago on a freezing roof. I'm fighting for this community, just like the Ukrainians are fighting for their nation. We the People have to rise up against these government elites who pay no price. We pay the price every time they say, "This saddens me." Enough. We the People must rise or we will perish. I know that we must continue to fight. We must continue to struggle because here on the South Side of Chicago, we can really relate to the Ukrainians.  God bless you. God bless America, but this time God bless the Ukrainians.

Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is taking aim at CNN over a recent report it ran about her state's ongoing COVID response.  "What was interesting about this story was it was completely not factual," Noem told Fox News Digital.  Earlier this month, CNN published a story with the headline, "Omicron may be on the decline, but this South Dakota hospital is still feeling its peak," citing a "60% [rise] in cases" at the Monument Health hospital in Rapid City.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS: KRISTI NOEM RIPS ‘RIDICULOUS’ MEDIA FOR SUGGESTING BIDEN CRITICS SIDE WITH PUTIN  "South Dakota doesn’t have any mask rules. Gov. Kristi Noem has refused to implement such mandates, or other restrictions, like limiting gatherings and events, leaving residents to make any safety decisions for themselves," CNN wrote.  Noem fired back on Twitter, writing, "@CNN falsely claimed that hospitalizations are ‘surging’ in Pennington County. Hospitalizations are in fact down 32% since the Omicron peak 3 weeks ago. This political hit job ignored the mountains of factual data that we sent to them. We are demanding a correction."  In an interview with Fox News Digital at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Noem claimed CNN "always gets everything wrong."  CNN TAPS NEW PRESIDENT, CURRENT EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF ‘THE LATE SHOW’ TO REPLACE JEFF ZUCKER  "They talked about COVID cases spiking when actually they have been declining, and were less than half of what they were reporting in their story. They did not focus at all on the people in the hospital that were doing better. In fact, they violated some HIPPA rules for some individuals that were there, and they did not work in cooperation with even that health system to make sure that they told a factual report of what was happening on the ground. So this is the kind of media story that we see a lot of, especially out of CNN, and they want to sensationalize something rather than make sure that people have information, which is truly supposed to be the job of an unbiased media," she said.  The South Dakota governor also weighed in on the media's evolution from the Trump era and into the second year of the Biden presidency.  "I would say that we've just seen the media overstep and be untruthful for years," Noem said. "It's gotten extremely bad since 2020 when the virus came to the United States. I think we've seen the media be used and used fear to motivate people and to promote an agenda."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "So in my leadership in South Dakota, we've tried to be truthful, get facts in people's hands so that they can make the best decisions for their families, and to make sure that they know that we trust them. I think many times I find in my interactions with many at the national media level is that they aren't telling the true story. They aren't telling all the facts in context that gives people the best information that they need to make the best decisions for their lives," Noem told Fox News Digital.

The New York Times claimed Sunday that President Biden was "redefining the arc of his presidency" following a number of policy setbacks throughout his first year in office and a sinking approval rating to one of the lowest in modern presidential history.  In a piece headlined, "10 Consequential Days: How Biden Navigated War, Covid and the Supreme Court," the liberal paper argued that Biden's handling of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, his nomination of Judge Ketanji Jackson as the potential first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, and the recently announced changes to CDC pandemic guidance were sidelining the legislative failures plaguing his presidency.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The dizzying events of the past week have pushed to the sidelines the congressional squabbling over President Biden’s domestic agenda, and are already redefining the arc of his presidency," the piece read, referencing the failure of Biden's Build Back Better agenda garnering enough support from Democrats to pass through Congress.  The piece cited "a dozen" anonymous current and former administration officials it claimed had knowledge of Biden's goings and comings from Feb. 18 through the weekend in regard to his handling of the situation in Russia, his selection of Jackson to the nation's highest court, and the announcement of the easing of CDC mask guidance.  "Mr. Biden’s aides say his actions in recent days were an example of the caution and consensus-building that have always been at the heart of his sales pitch to voters," it read, noting that his upcoming State of the Union speech received numerous edits as the situation in Russia unfolded, while still keeping "an eye firmly fixed on Mr. Biden’s place in history."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The piece then walked through Biden's day-to-day actions balancing the three situations, giving him an overall positive review for his performance and referring to him as "a student of international conflict and diplomacy."  The piece didn't, however, mention Biden's poor approval rating, which now stands at 37% according to the latest poll, nor did it offer evidence to suggest Biden's handling of Russia, which continued with its planned invasion despite the administration's announced sanctions, would change voters' views of his job performance.

Laura Ingraham said Monday that Russia's relationship with China is helping bolster the country's invasion of Ukraine, and the United States should sanction the Chinese Communist Party.  Russia has attacked Ukraine for five straight days, leading over 500,000 people to flee. The Pentagon Monday called Russian President Vladimir Putin decision to nuclear deterrence forces on "high alert" an "escalation."  "When words like 'heightened nuclear alert' are being used by the Russian president, we have to think really carefully about our next steps. We have to remember how we got here, and we also have to avoid making further mistakes down the road," "The Ingraham Angle" host said.  BIDEN HAS A 'GREAT DEAL OF ... EGO' IN HIS FOREIGN POLICY ABILITY, 'GETS VERY DEFENSIVE': MSNBC HOST  Ingraham said that one of the factors emboldening Putin to invade Ukraine was its relationship with China, a country that has become increasingly competitive with the U.S.  "[China is] now the invisible hand that drives a lot of the chaos in Ukraine and is enabling Putin to expand his borders," she said.  Ingraham then proposed sanctioning China.  "So even ramped up sanctions from Europe, which we applaud in the U.S., it's only going to go so far as long as China is Putin's reliable backstop. So for things to be really meaningful, to really stop the chaos, sanctions also have to be gradually directed against China as well," she said.  "We could move toward gradually or even immediately … to revoke China's permanent normal trade relations status, that would have to come from Congress. In addition, Biden could launch a new investigation into all their … unfair and illegal trade practices … Likewise, tariffs against China could be gradually raised over time," Ingraham explained.  OBAMA'S DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER: I WISH WE WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN 2014  "Biden's policies have made us less free, less prosperous and less secure. Americans want the opposite, and they can feel our country's standing in the world … evaporating. Right now, we seem to be buffeted by world events, we're not a mover of world events."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Ingraham cautioned against excessive spending given America's financial woes under Biden. "We're already 30 trillion dollars in the hole, we never want to talk about it, but there it is. That itself is eroding our economic strength and it's doing so every day," Ingraham said.  "And of course, while our hearts desperately break over Ukraine suffering and the human rights catastrophe being inflicted upon them."  "Here at home, Biden's policies have caused suffering for our own people as well. He's given us an open border, soaring inflation, runaway crime. Republicans should not rush to rubber-stamp any requests for more U.S. military spending without clear, clear directives as to how this will be spent, how this will be used."

Thousands of miles from where they were born, Russian Anastasia Shostak and Ukrainian Andrew Berezin developed a friendship in Los Angeles because of their shared Jewish faith.  Now they have yet more in common: Both are feverishly working to get their families out of their respective homelands and into Israel after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, and both turned out over the weekend in their adopted hometown to protest the invasion.  Los Angeles is home to many from the Eastern European diaspora, a place where Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Romanians, Georgians, Moldovians, Estonians and Lithuanians often pray, work, shop and eat together. The war triggered by Russia's invasion has resulted in raw and painful emotions in the pews of shared houses of worship and in the broader community.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Berezin, a software engineer, said that for years the community has been united by common bonds of faith, culture and history, but lately things have felt "strange."  "We may be from Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus or Moldova, but we've considered each other brother nations," he said. "We never thought each other as separate because of our shared legacy. I feel like now we're forced to separate. It feels like 'us' against 'them' now, and it's not good."  At Berezin's urging, his parents and 90-year-old grandmother crammed themselves and prized possessions into a tiny sedan and drove over 1,200 miles to Poland, where they await paperwork to join his sister in Israel.  On Sunday he was one of hundreds of demonstrators who turned out to wave flags, march and hold vigil in antiwar protests staged in both Hollywood and Santa Monica.  Shostak was among the numerous Russians who came to add their voices in opposition to their home country's actions. She and others openly proclaimed their disgust, sadness and remorse over the invasion.  Shostak, who helps run a program called Caring for Jews in Need at the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, has family in both Russia and Ukraine. She said she feels "guilty" even though she has never seen eye to eye with the Russian government or President Vladimir Putin.  "I know (Russians and Ukrainians) are friends here, but deep down there is probably that resentment of your country attacking my country," she said. "My country is the aggressor here. It's important for me to get out there and say I support my Ukrainian brothers and sisters. We need to say we're not enemies."  Like Berezin, Shostak fears for her parents' safety and is working to get them from Russia to Israel.  There are also Russians in the community who support Putin's actions, though they're generally keeping quiet on the issue, careful to avoid offending neighbors with whom they have bonded over the years.  RUSSIA COMPLAINS TO US AND CANADA ABOUT UKRAINE PROTESTS NEAR EMBASSIES  John Khrikyan, who worships alongside Ukrainians and counts many of them as friends, said in a phone interview that Putin is justified in attacking what Khrikyan considers an anti-Russian and corrupt government.  "Historically it's one people, one culture and one nation," he said of Russia and Ukraine. "I believe Ukraine should be an independent country. But we should be friends, not enemies."  "I'm proud to be Russian," Khrikyan said.  At local houses of worship, solidarity with Ukraine was the order of the day Sunday.  About 50 people attended a special morning service at Saint Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Church, a few miles northwest of downtown LA. Worshipers bowed their heads in prayer, and a few shed tears from closed eyes.  "I came here to show my support for Ukraine," said Liana Ghica, who dressed in the blue, yellow and red of her native Romania for the occasion. "This is not just about Ukraine but the future of our world, our freedom and the future of our children. It's about human rights."  In an emotional sermon, the Rev. Vasile Sauciur denounced the invasion as "madness" and "evil." He likened it to the biblical battle of David against Goliath and said the underdog Ukraine will emerge victorious, as David did.  "(Ukraine) doesn't have much, but we have the right purpose, the right motive," said Sauciur, who was born in Romania but has many Ukrainian family members and identifies as a Ukrainian priest. "I hope our good neighbors support us and remember that this pestilence can go beyond Ukraine. Good people must stand up for what is right."  PUTIN'S ‘ERRATIC’ BEHAVIOR HAS EXPERTS WONDERING IF HE'S MENTALLY UNSTABLE  Some at the service were praying for loved ones serving in Ukraine's armed forces.  Iryna Hetman-Piatskova cradled her cellphone in her palm as she looked at a photo of her son in fatigues, sent from the front lines.  "My plea is to the mothers of Russia to call their sons back home, to stop the war," she said tearfully. "From one mother to another, ask your sons to stop attacking."  And Natalia Blanco recalled speaking this weekend with her brother, who is in the Ukrainian army.  "He told me he is trying to be strong, but it's hard to see other soldiers dying," she said, holding back tears.  Lana Worth, a first-generation Russian American who counts both Russians and Ukrainians among her family, said she has been torn and doesn't wish to take sides.  "Do I hate my right hand or left hand?" she said. "Ours is a small world. Hating each other is not an option."  At the Santa Monica protest, held a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean on the city's Third Street Promenade, demonstrators gathered in the afternoon.  Katrina Repina held her infant daughter in one hand and a sign in the other that read: "I'm Russian, I'm sorry."  RUSSIA SENDS 400 MERCENARIES INTO KYIV TO ASSASSINATE ZELENSKY: REPORT  "I don't support Putin," she said. "My heart bleeds when I see all the news. I feel the Ukrainian people's pain, and I wish I can take that pain away."  Repina came to the protest with Hanna Husakova, a Ukrainian. The two connected via Instagram, and common bonds of language and culture were stronger than the war between their countries.  "Katrina asked me if I wanted to be her friend. She asked me, 'Do you hate me because I'm Russian?'" Husakova said. "I said, 'Absolutely not.' What's going on here is between governments, not people."  Jonas Gavelis, a Lithuanian native who moved to Santa Monica five months ago after winning the green card lottery, donned a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan "I'm not Ukrainian but I support Ukraine." He worried that the fighting could spill beyond borders, and his home country could be next in Putin's sights.

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern will be in attendance at Taste of the NFL – a pre-Super Bowl LVI culinary experience that aims to combat childhood hunger and food insecurity by raising funds and awareness for vulnerable groups.  Zimmern told FOX News Edge that he got involved with the annual benefit through his work with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization GENYOUth, which has partnered with Taste of the NFL for Super Bowl 2022. The two anti-hunger charities are organizing a ticketed live event at the world-renowned Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb. 12, where food and football will collide.  "Folks can come and participate, come down to interact with incredible chefs and the performance that we're doing with the demos live on stage as well as, you know, have a fantastic party with a purpose to raise money [and] provide hunger solutions for students in schools, which is what GENYOUth now specializes in," Zimmern said in a video interview with FOX. "They're one of the leaders in the country at this, and we're trying to raise as much money as possible."  FRIED HONEY BUTTER CHICKEN BISCUITS FOR YOUR NFL FOOTBALL PARTY: TRY THE RECIPE  He noted that childhood hunger has been exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation continue. These two challenges are especially concerning for Zimmern, who has been a hunger relief advocate for 30 years and has worked with various equity boards, including the New York-based Services for the UnderServed, the International Rescue Committee and more recently the United Nations World Food Programme as a goodwill ambassador.  "I haven't come across a problem that is as deadly and as crisis-filled as the global and national hunger crisis that we are currently enduring," Zimmern said. "I'm staggered by this… To me, it is the biggest head-scratcher of head-scratchers."  Zimmern went on to say that while he’s grateful nongovernmental organizations have stepped up to combat hunger, he wants the world to realize that a society that’s eliminated hunger with nutritious foods is likely to face economic and public health benefits, including less money spent on preventable food-related diseases, an improvement to national security, decreased pressure on the criminal justice system and overall productivity.  FOOTBALL BUTTERCREAM SUGAR COOKIES FOR GAME DAY DESSERT: TRY THE RECIPE  In his own words, "Food is both a tool for understanding other people, and it's also a solution to improving lives both here in America and around the world."  For citizens who would like to show their support for Taste of the NFL and GENYOUth, but won’t be able to attend the live event on Saturday, Zimmern said spreading the word about these two organizations or joining The Virtual Home Gate would be helpful.  The digital experience will include demos from celebrity chefs Carla Hall, Tim Love, Lasheeda Perry and Mark Bucher who going to be at the live event as well. Viewers will also be able to see discussion snippets from special guests, which NFL players, professional athletes and media personalities.

"Thanksgiving used to be the biggest food day in America. Number two was Christmas. Number three was Fourth of July. Now, number one is [the] Super Bowl. People watch football at home with their loved ones and they cook.  He continued, "As someone who loves educating, who loves providing adventure and joy in the kitchen and believes in putting food on people's plates, what a wonderful time of year, both to be celebrating food, but also raising money for a fantastic cause and making sure that those that don't have food are provided for."

Zimmern explained that remoulade – a French sauce – had been influenced by Spanish, Caribbean and West African flavors by the time it made its way to Louisiana.  Zimmern makes his recipe with a shrimp boil mixed with mustard seeds, chile fennel, lemon slices, chopped celery and onions, a can of beer and other seasonings, and he lets the ingredients simmer and steep at 200 degrees for 20 minutes or so.  In a food processor, Zimmern makes the remoulade from scratch with chile and Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, eggs, chopped scallions and celery, minced garlic, a spice mix with whole mustard seeds, horseradish, white vinegar and Old Bay seasoning.  Zimmern recommends pulsing the processor a few times before pouring in vegetable oil and letting it emulsify. After the ingredients blend together, the remoulade can be refrigerated while the shrimp cooks.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  When the shrimp batch is done cooking, Zimmern places the shellfish in a colander with a bowl underneath to catch excess liquid. He then covers the shrimp with ice to trap the flavor. Zimmern serves the shrimp with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, lemon wedges, Cajun seasonings, celery leaves and the remoulade sauce.  "Shrimp remoulade is one of the fastest, tastiest, most delicious treats that you could possibly imagine," Zimmern told FOX.  "I don't think there's a better dish. You [can] do it all ahead of time and simply pour the sauce on right before your guests get there. They can dip if they want. They can plate if they want. You can make a big batch, a small batch. You can do this with other meats or seafood or everything if you don't like shrimp, but I think it's fantastic."

Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619 when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.  Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW  From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.  Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.  Sojourner Truth  Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.  Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.  By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2022: MARYLAND TEACHER KEISHIA THORPE, WINNER OF GLOBAL TEACHER PRIZE, INSPIRES MANY  Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.  Baumfree famously delivered her "Ain’t I a Woman?" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Abraham Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book "The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave" (1850).  Frederick Douglass  Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.  He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.  Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" speech (1852) and "Life and Times of Frederick Douglass" autobiography (1881).  ALVEDA KING REVEALS HOW TO BE MORE LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN 2022  Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education, and the end of capital punishment.  Harriet Tubman  Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.  She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.  Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made "about 13 trips into Maryland" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to "about 70 more," according to the NPS.  By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.  George Washington Carver  Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.  While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.  Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.  YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE  Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.  Ida B. Wells  American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.  Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.  Some of her famous written works include "Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases" (1893) and "Mob Rule in New Orleans" (1900).  Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.  W. E. B. Du Bois  American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.  He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.  Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including "Black Reconstruction in America," "The Souls of Black Folk" and "The Talented Tenth."  Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that "builds Black political power to end structural racism."  Thurgood Marshall  Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.  He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.  From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.  THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE  Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were "separate but equal."  Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.  His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon B. Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.  Rosa Parks  Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.  At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.  The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.  The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.  She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.  Shirley Chisholm  Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.  In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.  Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director, and educational consultant before entering politics.  Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, where she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.  Martin Luther King Jr.  Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.  He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.  King delivered his most famous speech, "I Have a Dream," on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954 to 1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.  But it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photographs and video.

A water engineering nonprofit has sent a team to Ukraine's borders and neighboring countries in order to assess the safe water, sanitation and hygiene needs of tens of thousands of displaced refugees.  Water Mission's rapid responders, who are working alongside other humanitarian organizations in the region, are in the midst of determining where the biggest populations of refugees are. Once that's determined, they look into what safe water resources they can tap into, or if any safe water resources exist, in order to determine how to bring emergency safe water systems where they are needed most.  HELPING UKRAINIAN REFUGEES: NONPROFIT DELIVERING THOUSANDS OF HOT MEALS TO PEOPLE IN NEED  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  "As it becomes clear what role we're going to play, then we'll send over all the staff we need to run our response," Water Mission Senior Director Global Partnerships John Peays told Fox News.  Since 2001, the nonprofit has been implementing safe water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions for developing countries and disaster areas. To date, they have helped over seven million people in 57 countries.  One of the biggest areas of need during the current crisis, Peays projected, will be right on Ukraine's borders, where there is a build-up of cars, buses, and refugees on foot trying to escape into neighboring countries.  In fact, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted Monday that some wait times at Ukraine's borders are nearing 50 hours.  During any crisis, Water Missions CEO George Greene said "the need for emergency safe water access is critical for survival."  For instance, Greene told Fox News that "you can very quickly get into a situation where improvised water sources like shallow wells and trying to get water out of the ground, or even people drinking water directly out of rivers and nearby areas… get contaminated with human waste in an excessive way."  It can lead to water-borne illnesses and the worst case is when "cholera outbreaks happen," he said.  Cholera, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a "diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria."  People can get sick once they swallow food or water that has been contaminated with the bacteria, the CDC explains.

A nonprofit has been serving tens of thousands of hot meals to Ukrainians who are stuck in Ukraine or who have fled to neighboring countries.  CHURCHES IN UKRAINE, RUSSIA DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO EMBATTLED CITIZENS  For over a decade, the World Central Kitchen has provided meals to communities in need in the wake of humanitarian, climate and community crises.  When the conflict began to unfold in Ukraine, World Central Kitchen CEO Nate Mook told Fox News that the organization hit the ground running.  "We were watching as families were fleeing across the border into Poland and other countries," he said. "And so immediately we activated our team."  On Friday, the nonprofit, which teamed up with local chefs and restaurants, began serving hot meals at the 24-hour pedestrian border crossing in southern Poland. Since then, they have sent teams to a number of refugee shelters and other border crossings in Romania, Hungary and Moldova.  Mook said the first step was getting his team on the ground, including himself, as quickly as possible.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We've got meals that are being served throughout the day and all through the night," he said.  They have already distributed tens of thousands of meals with another 25,000 expected to be delivered on Tuesday, according to Mook.  "We're just moving as quickly as possible to get as much food to those that need it," he said.  Mook admitted that it's already been a pretty daunting journey.  "We're talking to a lot of Ukrainians and others who are fleeing Ukraine, and they're traveling for days," he said.  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  Mook said his team met a Ukrainian woman who walked 40 miles just to get to the border of Poland and then waited another 12 hours to cross the border.  In another instance, a young woman from Kyiv had walked two days in order to reach the border into Ukraine without a single hot meal.  "I think pretty much everyone we've been meeting has been in a state of shock," Mook said. "I don't think anybody really expected it to intensify this quickly or have to just literally run away from their homes, sometimes their families and friends."  The nonprofit is also working with restaurants in two Ukrainian cities, Odesa and Lviv, to help feed families that haven't fled.  "We're just here to cover as many gaps as possible," he added. "The most important thing is to appeal to folks who really need them right now."

Dramatic photos shared with Fox News Digital on Monday show one family's almost unbearable heartache as a Ukrainian father is forced to bid his tearful young son goodbye, telling the child, "Be brave for your mother."  The man was sending his family off to Hungary from a local train station in Ukraine, The Mirror reported.  The man's goal was to get his beloved family — his wife and two children — away from the danger and chaos of war as Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces continue to push their way into Ukraine in an all-out assault on that country.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The father and son are shown hugging and saying a painfully emotional goodbye to each other at the Lviv Train Station.  The dad, Ruslan Gladkiy, gave his nine-year-old son, Hordeiy, a big bear hug as he put him, his daughter and wife on a train in Lviv, the report noted.  Young Hordeiy was so overtaken with emotion in the moment of having to part with his father that he had to take off his glasses.  The father expressed how "very difficult" the moment was for him as well.  "I did not want to say goodbye to my family. They are going to Hungary," he told the outlet.  "We live 250 kilometers [about 155 miles] from Lviv and I drove them here this morning to get the train," the father also said, the report noted.  He added about himself, "I am staying."

Between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing cyberattacks, experts are warning about malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S., and some U.S. security pros spoke to Fox News about how to defend against technological assaults.  Russia is not likely to take President Biden’s new sanctions sitting down and has proven to be highly adept at cyber warfare, which has become part and parcel of active "kinetic" wars in the 21st century.  "This is not something to take lightly — cyber attacks don’t have borders," Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a tweet.  "I remain particularly concerned about the reports of cyber attacks…There’s historical precedent to suggest these could be devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire countries," Warner said in another tweet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russia has already launched what appears to be a series of cyberattacks on targets in the Ukraine. This past week, cyberattacks impacted the websites of several Ukrainian government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, according to Ukrainian officials. This follows cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites and banks that have been attributed to the Russian military spy agency GRU.  How to defend yourself from Russian cyber warfare ‘spillover’  As Sen. Warner suggested, cyberattacks don’t have borders. As a result, cyber spillover campaigns could reach the U.S.  "With the Ukraine conflict now front and center and poised to widen, we expect a surge of cybersecurity attacks from Russia state-sponsored organizations," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, told Fox News in a written statement.  Here’s what to watch out for and how to defend yourself, according to cybersecurity experts that Fox News spoke with.  --Ransomware: The bane of InfoSec professionals, ransomware attacks lock out companies and individuals from critical data. Attackers then demand hefty payments. "Businesses across the U.S. should be bracing for a variety of cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware," said John Dickson, vice president at Coalfire, a Westminster, Colorado-based provider of cybersecurity advisory services.  "Make sure that all critical and all internet-facing systems are fully patched to mitigate ransomware and data destruction," Lou Steinberg, cyber expert and founder of CTM Insights, told Fox News. "Use multi-factor authentication to log in to critical systems … and to prevent unauthorized changes (like turning off power or opening a valve on a dam)," Steinberg said.  --Denial of service attacks: Denial of Service, which renders critical computer services unavailable, and ransomware attacks are often "outsourced," according Steinberg. "Rather than the government directly performing them, they tend to be done by groups who believe they are being patriots by defending Russia's interests. It’s in [that] government's interest to enable this as it gives them deniability. You can’t trace an attack back to the Kremlin," Steinberg explained.  These outsourced actors "may be less capable" so companies can protect themselves if they take prudent cybersecurity measures, according to Steinberg.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: UKRAINE TO GET $350M MORE IN US DEFENSE AID: BLINKEN  --Social engineering campaigns: These attacks manipulate human behavior and "piggyback off of the news cycle," said Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions, at Lookout, a San Francisco, Calif.-based endpoint-to-cloud security company.  "Be especially vigilant about where you’re sharing data, who has access to it and the identity of anyone with whom you have interactions online," Schless said.  --Passwords: Consumers should always use multi-factor authentication and avoid reusing the same password across accounts/services, Alex Ondrick, director of security operations at BreachQuest, an Augusta, Georgia-based incident response company, told Fox News.  Ondrick said consumers can use sites like haveibeenpwned to see if they’ve been impacted by a security breach. "Regularly rotate passwords, especially on email/social media accounts, and for Wi-Fi and home router(s)," Ondrick said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  --Banking apps: "Consumers should be on the lookout for phishing and malware attacks, especially when accessing banking apps," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said. Consumers should use antivirus products as well as software that protects their identities, Ives added.  --Software updates: For individuals, it is important to follow cybersecurity best practices. That includes "installing recommended software and app updates, backing up their data and exercising caution when clicking links in emails, social media posts and online articles," Jonathan K. Osborne, a business litigation attorney at the Florida-based Gunster law firm, told Fox News.  --FBI: The FBI has a Cyber Threat website with tips and preventative measures on everything from email compromise to phishing and ransomware.

As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.  The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.  "Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred," FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.  Shah tells FOX News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal. Several parodies of Tom Cruise and other actors exist online.  TOM CRUISE DEEPFAKES ON TIKTOK POINT TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REALISTIC PHONY VIDEOS  The FBI gets involved if the video violates any federal laws, like extortion or fraud. Shah gave FOX News example of the voice of a company executive being manipulated.  "The same inflection. The same accent, and they make a phone call and you can ask the employee as the CEO, to wire that money."  A similar situation happened in Hong Kong as part of an international heist that is still under investigation.  While the FBI won't specifically comment on deepfakes as part of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, other intelligence sources say they are on the lookout for altered videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key players.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I think we are just starting to see the tip of the iceberg on these," cyber expert Matthew Canham told Fox News of deepfakes.  Canham has a stern warning for the public.  "I think it's probably wise to check everything that you see," he said. "Probably the more emotionally provocative it is, the more important it is to confirm the sources."

A Ukrainian-American pastor in Lynchburg, Virginia, said he's terribly concerned for the people of Ukraine in light of this week's Russia invasion — and sent an image to Fox News Digital showing Ukrainians huddled in the basement of a home in an effort to seek shelter and safety.  Yet even amid the difficulty, the pastor sees signs of the "strength" and "resilience" of the Ukrainian people that make him proud and hopeful.  Pastor Andrew Moroz told Fox News Digital in an interview on Saturday afternoon that in recent years, "It's been amazing to see the flourishing of a nation and of democracy — and also the fight to break free from that old former Soviet life."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  But what is going on right now, he also said, is a fight not just for democracy — it's "a fight for religious freedom as well."  That's because Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding that all Ukrainians defer to the Russian Orthodox Church — the state church — not the newly independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church, or any other faiths or denominations. "This is the way a dictator operates," said Moroz. "This is one of his public demands."  DRAMATIC VIDEO TAKEN FROM SPEEDING CAR SHOWS UKRAINE DEVASTATION  Pastor Moroz is a lead elder at Gospel Community Church in Lynchburg, Virginia; he was born in Ukraine in 1986. His family immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s, and since that time, he's been able to "spend more time in Ukraine" and even bring his family there for visits.  "The people of Ukraine want to remain free to practice their faith" and worship the Lord as they see fit, he said. They do not want to submit to Putin's demands in terms of acquiescence of any kind.  "Ukraine has experienced so much religious freedom over the last 30 years," he said.  "And that's the threat [right now]. I have quite a few relationships with evangelical leaders, pastors and nonprofits, and the threat for them is about going backwards — going backwards 30 years, 40 years, and not being able to express their faith" as they choose to, he said.  "The Ukrainians are very resilient people," he added.  "I'm hearing a beautiful defiance" right now in the faith-based community as they defend their country and their freedoms, the pastor said.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: FAITH LEADER SAYS 'HUMAN LIFE MORE SACRED THAN LAND'  No matter what happens, he said the Ukrainians are saying to themselves, "We're going to keep serving each other and the Lord." They're doing this "out of courageous humility."  Said Moroz further, "Their wish is for this to be resolved peacefully so that they can continue to function as a sovereign nation."  Pastor Moroz said the people of Ukraine, including his own family, have "had to practice our faith in secret in the past — we know what that is like. We have lived under a regime where we were not allowed to practice our faith."  His mother, who today lives in upstate New York, is "a mess" right now as she worries about relatives and friends in Ukraine, he said.  RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE: ‘BABIES AND CHILDREN PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE’  "She remembers the oppression" of earlier years. She lived in Ukraine when it was part of the former Soviet Union and "suffered" a great deal, he said.  "She made a decision to practice her faith even under communism. There were consequences, painful consequences, for that. So she's experiencing this moment in light of that, and she doesn't wish that on anybody … It's devastating" for her, he said.  Pastor Moroz also emphasized that even amid the pain, "there is the resilience of the Ukrainian people. They've found ways to live their lives even in the midst of difficult circumstances."  Moroz also said that because he "is cross-cultural and multinational," the church at which he serves has been very active around the globe. "In previous crises, we were there — we were at work in countries all over the world."  This crisis in Ukraine, he said, "just hits really close to home." He said his faith community has been rallying for the people of Ukraine. "We have stopped what we're doing [during the day] and just prayed for the Ukrainians … And we share truth and good information, as well as support. We had a prayer meeting last night," he also said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We had people praying in many languages, including Ukrainian. I'm praying that God redeems this difficult conflict," he said. "I hope that He brings people closer together" as a result of what's going on.

The bald eagle population is being poisoned by lead at an alarming rate.  Across the U.S., bald and golden eagles are repeatedly exposed to lead, according to new research. The study sampled more than 1,200 birds in 38 states and found that 46% of bald eagles and 47% of golden eagles have chronic lead poisoning.  Scientists believe eagles consume trace amounts of lead when they scavenge the animal remains left behind by hunters that used lead bullets.  The effects of lead poisoning can be deadly for birds and even slow the rate of population growth.  "What we saw in association with this lead exposure is population growth rates in bald eagles are being suppressed by 4% and 1% in golden eagles," said Vince Slabe, a wildlife biologist and co-author of the new study. "In a stable population, any suppression of this growth is of concern."  The study’s findings could signify a potential setback for the bald eagle, which was endangered from 1978 to 2007. Bald eagles were near extinction by the 1960s because of a now-banned pesticide called dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Since then, the bald eagle population has soared to more than 300,000 birds in the wild today.  Todd Katzner, a conservation ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and co-author of the new study, told Fox News the bald eagle population is still thriving despite the threat of lead poisoning. Katzner said golden eagles may not fare as well.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The bald eagle population is growing rapidly in North America," Katzner said. "But golden eagle populations are stable or declining at best, their populations are at about 30,000 … any amount of suppression is something that is going to raise eyebrows.  The findings of the study have renewed calls among conservationists, pleading with hunters to use non-lead ammunition. The federal government banned lead ammunition in hunting waterfowl in 1991. A number of states enforce their own regulations on top of that. California banned the use of lead bullets by hunters 2019.  2021 WAS SAFEST HUNTING SEASON EVER FOR THIS US STATE  Chris Parish, president of the Peregrine Fund, believes most hunters don’t know about the toxic effects of lead. He co-founded the North American Non-Lead Partnership to educate hunters and encourage them to voluntarily switch to alternative ammunitions that don’t use lead – like copper bullets.  "Hunters are the only way to solve this problem, and the best way to appeal to a hunter is to work with them not work against them," Parish said.

Model Elizabeth Pipko wants Ukrainians to know she is among the Americans rooting for their refuge amid the crisis of the Russia invasion.  Pipko, 26, who has long been outspoken about her patriotism, says the Russia-Ukraine crisis is a reminder that the people of the United States are "rooting and praying" for Ukrainians.  "We know that they don't deserve what is happening to them and hope, and pray, that they can be courageous, but also remain safe during this time," Pipko told Fox News Digital in an interview.  The founder of The Exodus Movement and author shared her personal connection to the conflict overseas.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I am a first-generation American, with my entire family being from the former Soviet Union, so I have a very strong connection to everything that is going on right now. My family members come from all over the region, Russia, Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine. Much of what makes me who I am came from that region of the world," Pipko shared.  Despite living thousands of miles away from the crisis, the New York native reminded us why all Americans should remain vigilant amid this devastating moment in history.  ‘It’s that simple'  "I have heard people ask, ‘Why we should care about what is going on in Russia and Ukraine today?’ We as Americans know what we stand for, and we know that an attack on democracy anywhere is an attack on democracy everywhere. It’s that simple," she said.  PETA MURGATROYD PLEADS FOR MAKSIM CHMERKOVSKIY’S RETURN AFTER RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE: ‘PLEASE PRAY’  Asked how she feels about the Biden administration's response to the horrific loss of lives taking place in Ukraine, she said she believes it's "incredibly early on" and not the time to pass judgment.  "One can only hope that they have learned their lesson after what we saw in Afghanistan and take proper action this time.  "The United States was challenged in a similar way during the Cuban missile crisis. What we should hope for and expect as Americans is that our country and this administration can live up to the courage, creativity and determination of the Kennedy administration and respond correctly to what we are seeing," the model continued.  CELEBRITIES REACT TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT: 'MY HEART HURTS'  Silence is not the answer  The crisis has prompted several celebrities, especially those with Ukrainian and Russian heritage, to speak out and call for an end. Many have shared the disbelief that war is occurring in 2022. Pipko declared this is another moment in history where silence is not the answer.  "I am always of the mindset of speaking up for what you believe in. At the least, that is what the Ukrainian people should expect from all of us today," she said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "None of us should see silence as a possible response when people’s lives are in danger. As Martin Luther King said, ‘In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.’ Silence is not only incredibly dangerous, but unacceptable when so much is at stake," Pipko concluded.  Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, including Kyiv, overnight Wednesday that Russia called a "special military operation."  President Biden announced new sanctions on Russia and the deployment of 7,000 more U.S. service members to Germany while maintaining that U.S. military will not fight in Ukraine.

The Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant winner this year is a St. George local, and she was not the only Utahn to shine at this year’s competition in Las Vegas.  Marianne Hamilton has been involved in the Southern Utah community for more than 10 years, leaving her mark on several organizations, the Spectrum newspaper reported. Since moving here from Northern California in 2014, Marianne and her husband Doug have become heavily involved in the Huntsman World Senior Games. Marianne discovered her love of athletics through participating and being a race director over the years.  It was her involvement with the Huntsman World Senior Games that led to her competing in the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant in 2019.  MISS AMERICA PAGEANT TURNS 100 YEARS OLD  "We were at nationals and this woman was greeting the athletes, and she was wearing a gown and her sash said Ms. Senior Utah, and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting.’ So I talked to her just real briefly," Hamilton said. "And then I ran into her again ... at another Senior Games event here. And we talked more, and she explained to me about senior pageantry and how it empowers women over 60 to still be out there and still give back to their community."  After looking into the website and speaking with the pageant director, Hamilton decided to compete in 2019.  Hamilton was diagnosed with breast cancer during her time between the 2019 and 2020 pageants.  It was an experience unlike anything she had previously had, but Hamilton said there were similarities between the senior athletic competitions and the senior pageantry. Both competitions focus on accomplishments in older people.  WOMAN DROPS 112 POUNDS, WINS BEAUTY PAGEANT AFTER FIANCÉ DUMPED HER FOR BEING TOO FAT  "I see very, very similar parallels between the Senior Games and being in the Senior Universe Pageant. And I think both are about a refusal to accept that age dictates boundaries," Hamilton said.  The Ms. Senior Universe Pageant focuses on competitors’ ability to show their accomplishments and how they portray themselves. There is no bathing suit competition. Instead, there are several days of questions and other ways for competitors to distinguish themselves.  One thing Hamilton excelled at was the writing portion of the competition. She is a journalist for St. George Health & Wellness Magazine and the St. George City Lifestyle Magazine.  "There was a lot of writing involved, which was kind of to my strengths, which was nice," Hamilton said. "You have to write several times; I had to write introductions for the judges to read. And you need to write out your philosophy of life and be able to recite that from memory within 30 seconds. There are a lot of photographs to gather and a lot of reflections about your life."  CHIHUAHUA BEAUTY PAGEANT GETS MORE THAN 800 COSTUMED PARTICIPANTS: SEE THE PHOTOS  With Hamilton turning 70 this year, the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant was a way to start the year with a big bang. She said she planned to perform her duties as Ms. Senior Universe USA while continuing to write and race.  "It’s really thinking about the fact that whatever age you are, you deserve to be celebrated," Hamilton said. "And the more years you have on Earth, the more cumulative experience as you bring to the party."  Hamilton said that when she started she wasn’t expecting to get breast cancer in between competitions, but she learned from the experience.  "I’m here to tell you that it’s not a death sentence," she said. "And those kinds of things all go into making you a stronger person, and maybe able to help other people who are going through it."

Jeanene Burton, a teacher in St. George for over 30 years, also was in the competition and won the "best gown" award. Shelley Sybil Gish, owner of the Healing Herb, foster mom of 53 kids over the years and first runner-up in the 2020 Ms. Senior Universe pageant, did not compete this year but traveled to Las Vegas to assist Burton, Hamilton and the other delegates.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is poised for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, carrying the GOES-T spacecraft to orbit. The two-hour launch window opens at 4:38 p.m.  GOES-T is the third in a series of upgraded spacecraft part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) program, a joint program between NASA and NOAA. The real-time data from GOES-T will help meteorologists around the country forecast hurricanes, better predict tornadoes and provide advance warnings for wildfires.  'IT SAVES LIVES': GEOSTATIONARY LIGHTNING MAPPER CRUCIAL FEATURE FOR GOES SERIES  Launch weather officers with the Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron predict a 70% chance of favorable liftoff conditions for the Tuesday window. The primary concerns will be cloud cover and possible lightning chances.  A cold front is expected to move through the Space Coast by Monday when ULA begins rolling out the Atlas V to the launchpad.  "This will bring scattered showers and a few thunderstorms through the Spaceport in the afternoon or evening, especially along the coast and just offshore," according to the 45th's launch forecast.  HOW NOAA'S NEW GOES SPACECRAFT WILL IMPROVE SPACE WEATHER FORECASTING  If liftoff delays 24 hours, chances decrease to 70% when the primary concern is cloud cover but the chances of rain showers decrease.  Once in orbit, about 22,000 miles above Earth, GOES-T will be renamed GOES-18 and take over for GOES-17, monitoring the western U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Mexico, Central America and the Pacific Ocean.  The GOES program dates back to 1975, when the first satellite known as GOES-A launched from Cape Canaveral. The most recent satellites in the series started launching in 2016, providing higher-resolution images of the planet in near real-time.  One of the instruments called the Advanced Baseline Imager, or ABI, on GOES-T can take an image of the Earth every 10 minutes while simultaneously looking at regional pictures for severe storms.  L3Harris built the ABI and contributed its first GOES weather imager in the early 1990s.  "[ABI] takes pictures in 16 different colors or spectral bands, ranging from the visible blue out to thermal infrared wavelengths," said Daniel Gall, Chief Systems Engineer for the L3Harris ABI team. "That helps forecasters characterize many aspects of the atmosphere and what's going on there."  L3 Harris also provides the ground system that helps command, control and downlink data from the GOES series.  "The ground system ensures that that data gets out to NOAA forecasters … less than 30 seconds after it's collected on-orbit, down to the ground and out to users," Gall said.  The ground system handles about 3.5 terabytes of data every day from the satellites.  Like the hundreds of people who have contributed to the GOES program, Gall said he's looking forward to seeing Atlas V liftoff with the new satellite.  "A launch is always a fun event," Gall said. "It's nice to see the culmination of, really, decades of people's lives put into developing, testing and ensuring these satellites are ready to meet the mission."  On Monday, ULA will begin rolling out the rocket and its payload to Space Launch Complex 41.

A former business partner of Hunter Biden was sentenced to federal prison for his role in a scheme to defraud a Native American tribe.  Devon Archer was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison by Manhattan Judge Ronnie Abrams for his role in a ploy that defrauded the Oglala Sioux tribe of nearly $60 million in bonds.  Before being arrested, Archer and Biden sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.  HUNTER BIDEN’S EX-LOVERS COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM AS FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATES HIS TAX AFFAIRS  Biden had no connection to the fraud scheme Archer was convicted for on Monday.  Archer’s attorney, Matthew Schwartz, said Archer — who has maintained his innocence — would be appealing the judgment ordering him to pay over $15 million in restitution out of pocket and over $43 million with his co-defendants.  "Mr. Archer is obviously disappointed with today’s sentence, and intends to appeal. It is unfortunate that the judge, who has previously expressed concern that Mr. Archer is innocent of the crimes charged and reiterated that belief today, felt that she was constrained not to act on her independent assessment of the evidence," Schwartz said following the sentencing.  In short statements to the judge, Archer and Schwartz said corrupt businessmen had taken advantage of Biden’s former business partner to use him in the scam.  "He came under the influence of a person he trusted too much and didn’t ask enough questions," Schwartz said.  Archer called the sentencing and facing down prison time "nothing less than surreal" and said he "was doing too many things at once and not paying enough attention" in regards to the fraud.  "I have deep remorse for the victims of the crime," Archer said, adding that he was also distraught about the pain he had caused his friends and family.  "I’m most sorry for my family and what I’ve put them through," he also said.  Abrams said that he could not let Archer walk for his role in the scheme, deeming the crime "too serious."  "There’s no dispute about the harm caused to real people," Abrams said, noting that the defrauded tribe is one of the most economically disadvantaged in the country.

Archer and his co-defendants were alleged by prosecutors as having purchased more than $60 million in bonds from the Oglala Sioux, which was then used to "build a financial services mega-company" instead of holding the bonds for annuity.

Retired four-star general Keane discussed President Putin past attempts to use violence to win control over the country of Ukraine and what his motivations could be.  Kellogg, who is currently in Moscow, discussed how the Russian people feel about their President’s desire to reestablish Russia’s power over Ukraine and his rationalizations to use military force.  Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment.

Prince said the Russians expected a cake walk and they have been put in a bad sandwich instead. Prince believes this was all preventable and points to the national command authorities in America for lacking any kind of imagination and the ability to come up with a different plan or accept a different plan despite all their talk of diversity. Prince says they only think within their beltway bubble which is extremely dangerous. Prince is pleasantly surprised that the Germans have come around to help Ukraine. Even more surprising to Prince is the Swiss sanctioning Russia because they didn’t even sanction Hitler. Prince also broke down a plan he offered the Biden administration back in December that was rejected which would have helped Ukraine prevent the Russians from invading.

Johnson says the Russian army is not as effective as Putin thought and that might be because of the low morale of the Russian soldiers. Johnson is hoping and praying for President Zelinsky, and believes he has shown true leadership, true courage. Johnson thinks Zelinsky’s leadership is one of the factors in terms of why Ukrainians are standing strong against Russia. Johnson also discussed the need to recognize that the sanctions are not working because too many countries are still dependent on Russian oil which they still continue to sell. Senator Johnson thinks the biggest blunder was the reluctance of the West, including the US, to fully arm Ukraine.

In light of what is happening in Eastern Europe, several Republican lawmakers are urging President Biden to stop relying on Moscow for oil. Lara says this is something former President Trump forcefully advocated for during his time in office.  “Oil is a big deal. And you know who knew that is Donald Trump. That’s why he opened up the Keystone XL pipeline. That’s why he made sure that Nord Stream 2 wasn’t fully available to be opened up to the Europeans because now you see the position, and he warned everybody about this. He was mocked in 2018 for warning Germany, if you’re too reliant on Russian oil, it’s going to put you in a bad spot. And look at the spot they’re in now. Look at the stranglehold that Vladimir Putin and Russia has on Europe, on most of the world. So why wouldn’t we want to make it ourselves here? Why wouldn’t we want to be energy independent? None of it makes any sense. You know, they always talk about climate change and it being greener. Well, the trucks that are having to transport the oil that we’re having shipped to our country across America are causing much more issue with the environment than a pipeline would. None of it makes sense. But yet again, just another reason we’ve got to have somebody that’s got some common sense in there. A lot of people say that would be Donald Trump.”  Later, Founder and Executive Director of Power The Future Daniel Turner breaks down the issues with the Biden administration being overly reliant on Russia for oil imports.

I’ve been coming since I was in college. I went to my first CPAC, I was literally a kid in college at Georgetown University. I considered myself a nerd. I take that with a badge of pride because I was just obsessed with politics. And I went on over to CPAC, it was just outside of Washington DC.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched an invasion of Ukraine. KT tells guest host Paul Gleiser President Biden’s inability to stand up to Putin allowed him to take this aggressive action.  “Biden gets into office, he shuts down the American energy industry. Six months into his administration, he then meets with Putin. And then he basically gives Putin a free ride with all that cyberhacking he was doing over the summer. And then, over the summer Putin issues a statement saying, in Ukraine there are Russian national people there. We have a historic right to Ukraine. And then we have the Afghan fiasco, the shambolic withdrawal. All of those things emboldened Putin to say to himself, well this is my time.”  Paul is also joined by Professor of Business and Economics at The King’s College in Manhattan Brian Brenberg, who explains the economic consequences of Russia’s invasion. According to Brian, this grave situation will impact people’s wallets in Europe, as well as the U.S.  Plus, Texas Congressman Pat Fallon discusses Putin’s actions, what he could be planning to do next and how President Biden should have initially responded when Russia began threatening Ukraine. Later, publisher of The Federalist Ben Domenech weighs in on what could happen next in Europe.

Jennifer discussed the growing concern surrounding Vladimir Putin’s mental state saying,  “We are in a very, very dangerous situation right now. I don’t think the world has ever been in a situation this dangerous. You are dealing with a an erratic leader. All of the world leaders who have met with him in recent weeks, whether it was the Finnish president or the French president, have said that he’s changed, that he is isolated, that he’s not in touch with reality and even his own inner circle and the people he relies on. You can see the look of fear on their faces.”

During an address to the nation on Tuesday, President Biden announced he is imposing new sanctions on Russia. The move is in response to their government officially recognizing two territories in eastern Ukraine as independent states. General Kellogg says Putin does not fear the current leadership in Washington.  “I’ve always said my biggest concern about Putin is he doesn’t understand the West. And what I mean by that is even when he was a KGB officer, he only went into East Germany one time on one tour. So he’s a little bit short sighted there on one what he sees the West doing. But at the same time, he doesn’t care. He’s operating from strength. And very candidly, he sees a very, very weak President of the United States that was there during 2014 as the Vice President. He saw his actions, what he did as Vice President to include what happened to Osama bin Laden. And then he sees what’s happening today. So when you go back to 2014, it’s not only his actions, it’s the actions that he saw that were generated from the administration, which happened to be Obama and Joe Biden. So he’s empowered by that. For good or ill, right or wrong, that’s the way this guy thinks.”  Later, Kentucky Republican Congressman James Comer talks about why it is unfathomable that certain school districts still require children to wear masks in the classroom. Plus, former Utah Congressman and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz stops by to share his thoughts on the infighting happening in the Democratic Party right now.

The President stated the U.S. has no intention of fighting Russia, but also made it clear the our country is willing to defend “every inch” of NATO territory. Johnny Joey does not think Biden took a decisive enough stance against Moscow.”  “If you’ve ever been playing Texas Holdem and you’ve got someone that’s raising the bet and raising the ante, and there’s always that one guy over there who’s just calling, and it’s all they’re doing, they’re just calling. Like, this person could raise the bet, however much they want. You’ve got one guy over there who’s reluctantly calling. You know one thing for sure, which is the guy calling does not have a great hand, but the guy raising the bet may have a great hand or no hand at all. And in this situation, our President is just simply calling, and you don’t win by calling. And that’s the concern here, is that we don’t have a decisive response to this. Even if you don’t think we should have a response, not responding is still being decisive. But this walking the dog technique really makes us feel like our president and leader is at a loss.”  Plus, Johnny Joey and Jimmy discuss the highly anticipated upcoming gubernatorial and Senate races in Georgia.
