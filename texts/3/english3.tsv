LVIV, Ukraine — One week into their invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces are ramping up assaults on civilian areas, making strategic advances in the coastal south and beginning to lay siege to major cities.  The invasion by President Vladimir V. Putin’s troops, which began on Feb. 24, kicked off Europe’s largest ground war since World War II.  In the days since, parts of towns and cities along Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia have been reduced to rubble by Russian forces, according video evidence verified by The New York Times and interviews with residents who fled. Major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, have faced significant onslaughts, with Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces had taken control of the first major city in the war, the strategic southern port of Kherson.  As the war moves to an increasingly brutal phase, Russian artillery and rocket fire have cut off electricity, water and heat to many communities. Reports are also multiplying of Russian strikes against hospitals, schools, apartment complexes and critical civilian infrastructure. And a humanitarian crisis looms: More than a million people have already fled the country, according to the head of the United Nations refugee agency.  Even as Russian forces continue their onslaught, soldiers and civilian warriors from Ukraine, a country of 44 million, are fiercely resisting the attack of its much larger and more heavily armed neighbor.  Russia has been making huge gains across the country, especially in the south, but it has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, a strategic setback for Mr. Putin that analysts attribute to Ukraine’s fighter jets and surprisingly resilient air defenses. Officials from Ukraine and the United States also say that a number of Russian units — which reportedly include many young, poorly trained conscripts — have been hampered a bit by delays, poor morale and shortages of food and fuel.  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine vowed on Thursday to regain control of parts of the country where Russian forces had made gains.  “I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily,” he said in an address to the nation. “We’ll drive them out. With shame.”  Here’s how the war is evolving:  Image Ukrainians taking shelter in a subway station in Kyiv on Wednesday. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times  Bombarding the capital  After facing stiffer than expected resistance, Mr. Putin has escalated the bombardment of Kyiv as his forces seek to topple the government. As many as 15,000 people, mostly women and children, have taken up residence in the subway system, The Times’s Andrew Kramer reported from Kyiv.  This week, a missile hit a television tower in Kyiv, and airstrikes hit a residential area of Zhytomyr, a city less than 100 miles west of Kyiv. A video verified by The New York Times also showed what appeared to be two Russian warplanes flying at low altitude moments before an airstrike hit a residential apartment complex in Irpin, a city on Kyiv’s northwestern limits.  Such attacks, along with a convoy roughly 40 miles long of Russian military vehicles that has been moving toward Kyiv in recent days, have stirred fears that troops may encircle and bombard what just a week ago was a peaceful, modern European capital of about 2.8 million people. But on Thursday, there were indications that the convoy may be struggling with soggy ground and other logistical issues slowing its advance.

Sergey Bobok/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images  Laying siege to cities  Mr. Putin’s forces have already surrounded the northeastern city of Kharkiv, 20 miles from the Russian border, and have been pummeling it from the outside with missiles and artillery shells.  Taking Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, would be a major strategic prize and could allow Russia to consolidate its forces in other areas. But holding a city requires significant troop presence, and Russia is already facing a rebellion of the general public. It is unclear what Russian forces plan to do should they gain control of government buildings — or how they would deal with what would probably be an insurgent effort to oust them.  What’s clear for now is that laying siege to Kharkiv will most likely inflict heavy collateral damage on civilians as the war grinds on. There are already reports of men, women and children in Kharkiv going days without food and water, huddled in freezing basement shelters as Russian forces continue to bombard a city that just a week ago had a population of 1.5 million.  Russia is also mounting increasingly brazen attacks on Kharkiv’s downtown infrastructure, a strategy intended to make the civilian population flee as part of a precursor to a ground invasion. Missiles have been hitting administrative buildings, and there have been clashes with Russian forces as they probe and test the city’s defenses.

Tyler Hicks/The New York Times  Gaining in strategic areas  Russia has made important strategic gains in recent days across southern Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Securing the south would cut off the Ukrainian government’s access to vital ports and could allow Russia to bring troops and supplies in by sea.  From the southern coast, Russian troops could move northward toward Kyiv and link up with fellow Russians who have been fighting in eastern Ukraine. That would expand Mr. Putin’s control east of the Dnieper River, which cuts through the center of Ukraine and divides its western and eastern regions.  Odessa, Ukraine’s biggest port city, is not as militarily significant as the nearby Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. But seizing it would be essential if Russia wants to control southern Ukraine, The Times’s Michael Schwirtz reported from Odessa on Wednesday.  Now that Russian forces have moved into the southern port of Kherson, they have a path to Odessa. They have also surrounded another key port city, Mariupol. If Mariupol falls, two flanks of Russian and Russian-backed fighters would be able to trap Ukraine’s forces in the southeast.  Russian naval ships have gathered just outside Ukraine’s territorial waters in the Black Sea. Ukraine has accused Russia of firing on civilian ships and using them as cover.

Ivor Prickett for The New York Times  Rising anxiety  In western Ukraine, people have sought refuge from the invasion in Lviv, a city of ornate buildings about 45 miles from the Polish border that has so far been spared heavy combat.  But since the first air raid siren wailed a week ago, there has been a growing sense of urgency and anxiety in Lviv.  A vast network of volunteers has emerged to help both those fleeing conflict and others heading off to the front. The roads into the city have also been lined with checkpoints and hastily erected defenses.  Heavily armed soldiers patrol the streets, stopping strangers and apprehending people they contend are Russian agents and saboteurs. In one incident that a New York Times reporter witnessed in Lviv on Tuesday, several men were pulled out of a red sedan in the heart of the old town and bundled away by security.  In restaurants that remain open, bottled water is now served exclusively in plastic bottles. The glass ones are being used to make Molotov cocktails.  Marc Santora reported from Lviv, Ukraine, and Mike Ives from Seoul.

The next morning, Russia invaded Ukraine, and Mr. Malikov hasn’t been heard from since. On Monday, Ukraine published a video of a captured soldier in his unit, apologizing for taking part in the invasion.  “He had no idea they could send him to Ukraine,” Mr. Malikov’s brother, Rashid Allaberganov, said in a phone interview from the south-central Russian region of Bashkortostan. “Everyone is in a state of shock.”  The reality of war is dawning across Russia.  On Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry for the first time announced a death toll for Russian servicemen in the conflict. While casualty figures in wartime are notoriously unreliable — and Ukraine has put the total of Russian dead in the thousands — the 498 Moscow acknowledged in the seven days of fighting is the largest in any of its military operations since the war in Chechnya, which marked the beginning of President Vladimir V. Putin’s tenure in 1999.

The movements indicated a high level of trust between Russian and Chinese officials.  China and Russia have been strengthening their economic, diplomatic and military ties for years. Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin met 37 times as national leaders before their latest conclave in Beijing. The ambitious joint statement that the two nations issued during that meeting alarmed American and European officials, especially because it was the first time China had explicitly sided with Russia on issues concerning NATO and European security. European leaders have denounced China and Russia since then.  Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was not familiar with the intelligence on discussions between Russia and China over Ukraine, but Beijing’s support of Moscow was clear.  “The Chinese support all of Putin’s narrative to blame the West for provoking Russia,” Mr. Gallagher said. “I see no change in the Chinese views on Russia. They remain in a de facto alliance against the West at this point.”  For months, some American officials tried to recruit China to help avert the war.  Days after President Biden spoke to Mr. Xi in a video summit on Nov. 15, senior American officials decided to present intelligence on the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine to senior Chinese officials to try to get them to persuade Mr. Putin to stand down. The Americans talked to Qin Gang, the Chinese ambassador in Washington, and to Wang Yi, the foreign minister. In a half-dozen meetings, including one in Washington between U.S. officials and the Chinese ambassador just hours before the Russian invasion, Chinese officials expressed skepticism that Mr. Putin would invade Ukraine, American officials said.  After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials received intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord and that China would not try to impede Russian plans, American officials said.  U.S. intelligence findings and assessments of Russian plans for an invasion of Ukraine have generally been accurate. The Americans began a campaign last fall to share intelligence with mainly ally and partner nations and to present declassified material to the public to build pressure on Russia to halt any planned invasion. William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, flew to Moscow on Nov. 2 to confront the Russians with the information, and on Nov. 17, American intelligence officials shared their findings with NATO.

On Thursday afternoon, they were equally resolute when they came to the opposite conclusion.  In a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee bowed to heavy internal pressure and barred athletes from Russia and Belarus on the eve of the opening ceremony, extending the global sporting isolation of both countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.  Citing threats by several federations to boycott the Paralympic Games, mounting discontent in the athletes’ village and fears that a “deteriorating” situation there could lead to violence, the International Paralympic Committee said the situation had changed so dramatically overnight that the viability of the Games would be in jeopardy if organizers did not expel the Russian and Belarusian delegations.  “The environment in the village is deteriorating,” said Andrew Parsons, the president of the I.P.C. He said rising anger and threats by multiple national committees, some under pressure from their governments, to withdraw from the Games had made the situation “untenable.”

Gone were the expansive warnings about the “existential threat” of climate change, explicit promises to advance “racial equity” in infrastructure projects and even the name of his $2.2 trillion Build Back Better package of social welfare and climate spending, once promoted as a transformative initiative akin to the Great Society programs of the 1960s. Instead, Mr. Biden described his agenda as a solution to the “rising cost of food, gas, housing,” pivoting to more centrist language in a nod to disaffected moderate Democrats who have pushed for their party to focus on the daily concerns of voters ahead of midterm elections they are expected to lose.  But while Mr. Biden changed his message, he spent much of his speech calling on Congress to resurrect pieces of his stalled domestic agenda, including expanding child care, lowering prescription drug prices and a minimum wage raise proposal that faltered in the Senate early in his term. And it was not clear how successful Mr. Biden would be in salvaging pieces of the social policy package, which fell apart late last year amid opposition from key moderates in his party.  There were glimmers of hope on Wednesday for reviving some aspects of Mr. Biden’s plan. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the centrist Democrat who abruptly ended talks over the sprawling spending plan in December, outlined the broad strokes of a package he could support, after weeks of declining to discuss details.

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.4 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.  Tracking vaccination rates by country Charts show countries with at least 100,000 people  Less wealthy countries are relying on a vaccine-sharing arrangement called Covax, which originally aimed to provide two billion doses by the end of 2021 but repeatedly cut its forecasts because of production problems, export bans and vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.

This was a nod to the more than two dozen state legislatures that already had laws responding to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. The Democratic Socialists of America, of which Tlaib is a member, endorsed B.D.S. in 2017, and both Tlaib and Omar had voiced support for the movement. In response to the Republicans’ bill, a version of which was previously introduced in 2017, Tlaib tweeted that the sponsors “forgot what country they represent,” which critics charged was perpetuating an anti-Semitic trope accusing Jews of dual loyalty.  Tlaib’s timing couldn’t have been worse: The Democrats had recently taken control of the House, and Republicans had already zeroed in on the Squad’s left-wing politics. “I don’t see much hope for changing where Tlaib and Omar are, but there is a battle in the Democratic Party,” Norm Coleman, the former Republican senator from Minnesota who now presides over the Republican Jewish Coalition, said at the time. House Democrats “will have to make choices about whether they’ll quiet those voices or whether they’ll remain quiet.”  Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, admonished Democratic leadership for not “taking action” against the anti-Israel stance of Tlaib and Omar, to which Omar tweeted in reply, “It’s all about the Benjamins” — $100 bills. The ensuing maelstrom defined Tlaib’s career for the next several months. Tlaib came to the defense of Omar (who apologized the next day) even as Democratic leaders issued a statement to condemn Omar for anti-Semitic remarks. The party was already sharply divided on B.D.S.; Speaker Nancy Pelosi described it as a “dangerous” ideology “masquerading as policy.” By that summer, the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution to oppose boycott efforts targeting Israel; Pressley broke with her Squadmates and voted in favor. The anti-Semitism charge, Lara Friedman told me, was a “sharp knife” that Republicans could throw “and watch Democrats attack each other.”  According to Tlaib’s friends and staff, she hadn’t expected the level of vitriol flung at her and her colleagues. Yet, at times, even her critics seemed unsure of how to respond to Tlaib’s unique position as a Palestinian American member of Congress. Shortly after her election in 2018, Tlaib announced plans to lead a congressional delegation to the Palestinian territories, a tour that would focus on poverty and water access. The trip would coincide with the annual AIPAC-sponsored congressional visit to Israel led by Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader. After public encouragement from Donald Trump, Netanyahu announced on Twitter that Tlaib and Omar, who planned to join the trip, were barred from entering because of their support for B.D.S. The move drew criticism from Hoyer, and even AIPAC and several Republicans. Tlaib asked permission to at least visit her grandmother in the West Bank, who was 90 years old at the time, promising to not promote boycotts while there. Israel acceded to the terms, but in a sudden about-face, Tlaib decided not to go. In a statement, Tlaib said that visiting under “oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me would break my grandmother’s heart.”  One aide to a Squad member, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, told me that wanting to show solidarity with Tlaib gave their boss more courage to speak on the issue. McCollum told me she receives less pushback from colleagues now than she did for her earlier efforts to recognize basic rights of Palestinians. “If I can speak out about what’s happening at home,” she said, “why can’t I point out when another democracy is not behaving in a way that I think lives up to human rights norms?”  Even President Biden, who during the May 2021 conflict reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself, made a point of speaking to Tlaib about the situation when he met her on an airport tarmac during a trip to Michigan. According to Tlaib, Biden brought up the conflict first, asking how her family was doing in the West Bank. Over the course of the eight-minute conversation that followed, the president listened as Tlaib spoke about the dire situation in the West Bank. “Everything you’re doing is enabling it more,” she later said she told him.

There’s no sort of axis of authoritarianism between Turkey and Russia. Meanwhile, India, which is more democratic, has been more hesitant in going after Russia. And you could go on down the list. But basically there’s just a lot of ways in which the world runs on interest-based alignments as much as on ideological ones, even right now.  Lulu Garcia-Navarro: Which brings us, I think, to Biden. He got a united front from both parties in Congress on Ukraine during the State of the Union. How does that help him, the West, in the days and weeks to come, if at all?  Thomas L. Friedman: I think Biden’s done a good job of both rallying America and rallying the NATO alliance and the global world here. I think that’s been very important. And I’m sure he’ll benefit politically from that. But for me, Lulu, what drives everything is what happens on the ground in Ukraine. And if the Ukrainians can hold out in this hyper-connected moment, even just for another week or two, and continue to inflict casualties on the Russians, that’s going to be what drives everything and will open up all kinds of possibilities.  Yara Bayoumy: I think we actually saw a shift in Biden’s messaging in the run-up to this conflict, then kind of turning very deliberately towards addressing Americans and kind of trying to communicate the costs that this means, especially in terms of rising energy prices, which I think is a concern for many Americans as well. And as we’ve been seeing, after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, all of this talk about how the U.S. is kind of no longer in the war business.  For Biden to be confronted with this scenario has meant that he can no longer focus domestically possibly as much as he would have liked to, and has to put a lot of attention on this crisis right now. But it will inevitably have repercussions at home as well. And I think that is where Biden is also really mindful of and trying to make the case and tread this very fine line between the U.S. standing firm against Russia’s aggression but also stating very clearly why that is important and why it is important for Americans to bear some of these inevitable costs.  Ross Douthat: I think Biden has done a good job so far. I think his administration has done a good job in this weeklong context of the war in terms of taking a leadership role but also letting Europeans take the lead as they need to do for our interests and their own, in terms of not leaping towards crazy ideas like a no-fly zone while also genuinely supporting the Ukrainians. I don’t know how much it helps Biden politically in the long run, any of this.  The two most likely scenarios are the grinding occupation and war in Ukraine. That doesn’t help Biden politically. But then I can also imagine a world where we do some version of the dirty deal that we’re talking about, that I think is probably necessary, where then Republicans run against Biden in 2024 saying, “Why did he cut this deal with the evil aggressor Putin?”

My uncle, for example, is Ukrainian and my wife’s grandmother, born in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, survived the Nazi occupation of Kyiv. It’s hard to find a Russian family without Ukrainian relatives and friends, husbands and wives, girlfriends and boyfriends, chess partners and colleagues. Many of them are now hiding in bomb shelters in Kyiv and Kharkiv.  They’re under attack by a Russian Army whose soldiers — young men who have spent their entire lives under Mr. Putin — look forlorn and confused. They were told by their commanders that they were going to the Ukrainian border to take part in logistical drills, only to find themselves at war. Mr. Putin seemingly dreamed of a quick victory with Russian-speaking Ukrainians welcoming their “liberators” with flowers, the Ukrainian Army surrendering en masse and the country’s leaders fleeing in fear. None of this is happening.  Instead, as the Ukrainians bravely resist the onslaught, Russians are feeling the pain of wide-ranging international sanctions and reprisals. With no European Union country accepting flights from Russia and America closing its airspace, thousands have been left scrambling in airports — while others wait in long lines at A.T.M.s as the ruble plunges. For ordinary Russians, poorer and cut off from the world, the costs of Mr. Putin’s aggression will be high.  State propaganda is baying hysterically, doing its best to rally people behind the war — even while refusing to call it that. In fact, the censorship ministry is punishing those few remaining independent media organizations, including Meduza, where I work, that dare to call Russia’s war what it is. On Tuesday, the government took Echo of Moscow and TV Rain, the last remaining independent radio station and TV channel, off the air. Demands to punish the “fifth columnists” and “traitors” — in effect those who sympathize with Ukraine — are growing louder and louder. Political repression will surely intensify.  The Kremlin would like to suggest that most Russians are unconcerned about the misery already ricocheting their way. According to a state-owned pollster, 68 percent of citizens support the war. But there’s a big caveat: The survey never mentioned war at all. Instead, it asked people whether they support what the government calls a “special military operation,” aimed among other things at “preventing a NATO base in Ukraine” and “denazification of Ukraine.” What the poll really shows is how state media dominates public opinion.

Not content to strangle most political opposition and forms of civic expression within Russia, the ex-K.G.B. clique now running the country is using its position to further a revisionist ideology — one that hungers to reassert Moscow’s control over the former Soviet Union countries and to discredit the democratic world for its failure to stay united and respond. Again, make no mistake: Mr. Putin aims to advance this ideology by going for blood beyond Ukraine. He must be stopped.  The shelling across Ukraine is not letting up; it’s gotten worse here in Kyiv, with women, children and other noncombatants taking refuge in bunkers and subway stations while Russia’s invading forces indiscriminately strike residential buildings and civilians. A high-rise apartment building has been hit, and at least one hospital has been damaged. They have fired rockets into the center of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and attacked the Chernobyl power plant.  This is Moscow’s way of war. Mr. Putin’s forces will continue to terrorize the country to induce surrender. If they don’t succeed, they will burn it all down. It’s either bow or vanish; no third option is allowed.  This is not going as planned for Russia, however. Everyday Ukrainians are confronting Russian soldiers, blocking tanks with their bodies. Russian forces are experiencing fierce resistance from both the Armed Forces of Ukraine and from Ukrainian citizens hurling homemade Molotov cocktails that Ukraine’s government is encouraging them to make. Ukrainians are defending their streets, their communities, their country and their identity. At the same time, Russian soldiers are surrendering en masse or sabotaging their own vehicles to avoid fighting, according to the Pentagon. They must know this war is unjust.  We beseech our Western allies and partners to make the costs unbearable for Russia now.  Article 4 of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances guaranteed that the United States, Britain and Russia would seek “immediate” action from the United Nations Security Council “to provide assistance” if Ukraine “should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.” Just because the aggressor — Russia — vetoes U.N. Security Council action does not relieve the other parties of the promises they made to Ukraine.  Even though Mr. Zelensky and I cannot be physically alongside every brave Ukrainian fighting for this country, our spirit is with them.  Every day brings the possibility that our words may be our final ones. So let them be a plea for support for a free Ukraine.

I’m going to just turn off my heat.  jon stewart  Did you say turn off your heat? She’s going to freeze to death if this goes on.  kara swisher  I’ll be OK. I’m wearing my lesbian power jacket here.  jon stewart  Should I turn of f— I have a hydraulic power drill. Should I turn that —  kara swisher  Yeah, just keep doing it. It’s no problem. Whatever you want. Whatever funny noises you want to make is fine with me. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Kara Swisher, and you’re listening to “Sway.” My guest today is Jon Stewart, the TV icon who hosted Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” for 16 years before leaving in 2015. He came back to TV— well, to Apple TV Plus, with his show, “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” which launched last year and is back with new episodes, starting this month. I wanted to talk to him about his TV comeback, the news these days, and if he could do it all over again, whether he’d choose to leave his own powerful podium just before Donald Trump became president. Jon Stewart, welcome to “Sway.” Why are you laughing already?  jon stewart  No, that was — would you have chosen to leave knowing Donald Trump was going to be there? And I think the answer would be a resounding, oh, most definitely.  kara swisher  Most definitely. OK, we’ll get to that. But let’s start first with what’s going on in the news right now. Russia’s invading Ukraine on a scale we haven’t seen since World War II.  jon stewart  Right.  kara swisher  Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on special alert. It doesn’t seem to be going very well for Putin at the same time. If you were making a Daily Show right now, how would you cover this and how do you look at this crisis right now?  jon stewart  These are the kinds of things that are really difficult to cover because of the human element. Generally the first order of attack would be on the powers that be, and the second order of attack would be on the way that the media covers the powers that be. In these types of situations actually, the media generally shows what they’re capable of. It’s the kind of crisis that their infrastructure in 24 hour seven days a week urgency matches the moment. So it’s one of those situations where you really go, oh, right, this is what they’re built for. They seem to have moved beyond the, you know, crisis in Ukraine — let’s bring on Van Jones and Rick Santorum. What do you think? They’ve moved beyond that kind of paradigm, so chances are what we would do, I think, is try and find an absurdity but also recognizing that the immediacy of the human tragedy is one that you have to always be cognizant of. You can’t be, you know —There are a lot of times at the show where we were more comedian than man. This is one of those situations where you probably have to be more human than comedian.  kara swisher  So meanwhile, it is actually also a narrative. And Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, is becoming a global hero. Which of course, is pissing Putin off. Zelensky came up as a comedian. And you recently said we’re watching Shecky Greene, which is a great, reference, transform into Churchill. Can you talk about that?  jon stewart  Talk about Shecky Greene?  kara swisher  If you’d like to, but what’s your observation?  jon stewart  No, I think it’s—  kara swisher  Well, explain Shecky Greene for the people who do not know in the back.  jon stewart  Well, Schecky Greene is sort of an old Borscht— there’s a strong tradition of Borscht Belt tumblers, and Shecky Greene was just one of the best. And I meant it— look, comedy is reductive when it comes to its references, but just in the sense of watching someone elevate to a position to come from— not to be Drake in this situation, but now we here. I think it’s always impressive to watch someone meet a moment no matter where they come from. But I think there’s a special resonance if you feel like it’s one of your own. You know it feels like? You remember “Working Girl“? Do you remember the scene in “Working Girl” where she gets in the corner — Melanie Griffith gets in the corner office. And then everybody in the steno pool is like, yes.  kara swisher  She did it.  jon stewart  I think there’s something like that.  kara swisher  Yeah, is that what you’re all doing in the steno pool of comedy?  jon stewart  Yes.  kara swisher  You’re all going, yes?  jon stewart  We’re all in steno pool going —  kara swisher  Yes.  jon stewart  But beyond that, though, I think it’s tinged with melancholy because of why he has to meet the moment. And the fact that like, the moment’s not over.  kara swisher  Right.  jon stewart  And —  kara swisher  No, he’s in a lot of trouble.  jon stewart  He’s in a lot of trouble. And your fear is that the media can make a hero and a narrative out of a moment, but this is an individual who now has a 40-mile convoy of artillery facing him down. And I don’t know how you Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid this thing. I don’t know how you get out of this. And the other side of it is I think I’m still a little bit in shock as to any time newsreels come to life, I think there’s always a little sense of, oh, right, this shit’s way more fragile than we probably gave it credit for. And I think I’m still in a little bit of that. Like, wait, are mad men still allowed to roll tanks through borders? And there’s also a little chauvinism involved, I think. Because, quite frankly, you know, Saudi Arabia’s still bombing the shit out of Yemen. We bombed the shit out of Iraq. I’m not saying it’s an analogous situation, but those human beings on the other end of those armaments are as human being-y as the ones in Ukraine. You know, everybody’s got their flags up and their other things. And right now, around the world, there are communities in terrible suffering, from Yemen, to Palestinians, to all around the world.  kara swisher  And this story has captivated people. I mean, he is using some of the techniques of an entertainer to do that, Zelensky. He’s using photos, he’s using Twitter. He’s certainly trying to avail himself to narrative, which is a good narrative which people get Dr. Evil versus the good guy, essentially.  jon stewart  Yeah, I mean, I think that’s what you do when you don’t have a 40-mile convoy of armaments. I have a feeling that if he didn’t have to go on TikTok, he wouldn’t.  kara swisher  Right, if he didn’t. But he’s winning the social media game, but —  jon stewart  Yeah, I mean, but that’s going to be cold comfort when —  kara swisher  Yes, exactly.  jon stewart  — there’s a giant crater near your house.  kara swisher  Indeed. So one of the things that — meanwhile, the Republicans led by Donald Trump have been cheering on the other guy Vladimir Putin. Are you shocked? Surprised? Neither? You had an interesting tweet last week. You said, “For Fox News and Donald Trump, the American left and most of Europe are the evil empire.”  jon stewart  Yeah, I mean, I think that’s been for years. That’s not anything new. I think for years, it’s been pretty clear that they would much rather do a deal with Putin than Pelosi. I know it might be an easy and cheap thing, but Steve Bannon, that’s his strategy. He’s working with those guys — you know, their Hungary and Eastern Bloc dictators are their test kitchens in the way that McDonald’s will test a new sandwich in Columbus. They’ll test media strategies. They’ll test other stuff. That wing of it is in league. They view Putin as a defender of Western civilization. They view him as an ideological brother.  kara swisher  Meaning they want to be him. That’s why they cheer him on, presumably.  jon stewart  I don’t know if they want to be him. But I think they see his — look, it’s an Orthodox Christian, generally homogeneous society, very conservative, unfriendly to gays and minorities like, kind of their world, isn’t it? If they were able to say what they really wanted to say — and sometimes they do say it, depending on which hour of Fox you’re watching.  kara swisher  Well, speaking of that, Tucker Carlson was one of Putin’s early defenders.  jon stewart  I’m sorry. What’s the name?  kara swisher  Tucker Carlson. Have you ever heard of him?  jon stewart  Hmm.  kara swisher  No?  jon stewart  It sounds fictitious to me.  kara swisher  All right.  jon stewart  It sounds like something you would make up in a — it’s one of Holden Caulfield friends, I believe.  kara swisher  The one you don’t like, right? And he’s reeled it in a little now, but Russian state TV even used clips of Tucker Carlson, this person you may or may not have heard of. Fox News shows some kind of bizarre support footage. Let’s play one clip here. Here, Carlson is talking about how Americans have been conditioned to hate Putin.  archived recording (tucker calrson) Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. archived recording Right. archived recording (tucker calrson) Vladimir Putin didn’t do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much?  kara swisher  So your reaction?  jon stewart  So that checklist that he ran down is actually — used to be on my dating profile. So it would always be when I was looking for a prospective mate, it was always, do they —  kara swisher  Do you eat dogs?  jon stewart  Do they manufacture fentanyl? Do they eat dog? Are they calling me a racist? If they could pass that test, we were ready to go share a meal or anything else that we might be able to come up with. When you deal with such a dishonest propagandist — and that is what he is — there’s nothing you can take out of context, because none of it is real. He’s admitted when he’s cornered, he lies. It’s all a game and a performance. I mean, honestly, I have no idea what the fuck that guy believes, truly. How does anybody go on television and say, why shouldn’t I be rooting for Russia? Which, by the way, I am. Let me just set it straight out.  kara swisher  Right, well —  jon stewart  That’s who I’m rooting for in this —  kara swisher  He did not take your parking space, Jon. He did not take your — that’s a red light to me. He didn’t take my parking space, and I was like —  jon stewart  Well, but isn’t that the way we judge dictators and atrocities — are they nice to me? This Hitler guy, yes, has he done some things? But I got to tell you something— always holds the door. Very polite. In some ways, I think then you have to ask the question, why is Rupert Murdoch trying to destroy the fabric of this country? What’s in it for him?  kara swisher  Answer — why do you think?  jon stewart  I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s ideological or he just thinks, this is where the money is. But how somebody can in good conscience put a shithead like that on television every night to say those types of things, that’s where the responsibility lies in my mind. Because it’s, you know, I always like to look at it as the difference between ignorance and evil, right? Ignorance is an epidemic and an entirely, in some ways, curable condition. So I like to think that the majority of us are, in our own way, just trying to create the world we would prefer to live in and trying to overcome the blind spots and the ignorance that exists in all of us in different ways. And then there’s a few people out there who are dishonest and using disinformation to achieve nefarious aims. And that’s the category I’d go there. So I try and draw a distinction, because I think if you use a broad brush, you’re less safe. And I really try hard not to dismiss all.  kara swisher  But it does work. It does work with his listeners.  jon stewart  But the difference is, those listeners, many of them, are redeemable, that have potential to grow beyond that or to get out of it. Or it’s — cult leader is the one responsible, not necessarily the flock. The flock may be lost. They may be easily moved by that, and —  kara swisher  So how do you separate them when this stuff does resonate? My mom listens to Fox News, and she’s like, well, Putin ain’t nothing to me. And I’m like —  jon stewart  Right.  kara swisher  Not today.  jon stewart  But you love your mom.  kara swisher  Yes. Yes.  jon stewart  Kara.  kara swisher  Not when she’s a —  jon stewart  Kara.  kara swisher  Not when she’s a Fox News watcher, when she does this —  jon stewart  You love your mom.  kara swisher  Yes, I do. Yes, I do.  jon stewart  And there are things about your mom that are redeemable. Is your mom evil?  kara swisher  No.  jon stewart  Does she have blind spots?  kara swisher  Indeed.  jon stewart  Is she worth staying with?  kara swisher  Well, what’s interesting is that the propaganda is so effective that it doesn’t ever leave. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult. I think a lot of people are in that position of anyone who has someone who’s moved down that road. They do listen to it. And more Republicans have a negative view of Joe Biden than of Vladimir Putin, according to one —  jon stewart  Yes, that’s right.  kara swisher  — the Fox News polls. This was before Russia invaded Ukraine. But —  jon stewart  But you have to try. You can’t stop. My wife and I play a game. We live in an area that’s very red. And so we like to play a game when we’re driving somewhere called “Insurrectionist” or “Just Supporter.” And so when we’re driving, we’ll see somebody. And you’ll just be like, OK, that guy’s got — OK, there’s a flag on the truck, but nothing else. And that’s a flannel coat. I’m going to go with supporter. And then you’ll go by and you’ll see somebody with, don’t tread on me, no more media bullshit, and be like, OK, that’s a guy who would probably take a shit in the rotunda if he had a chance to. But it’s an important distinction.  kara swisher  Your wife sounds very nice playing this game, even though she makes fentanyl and eats dogs, presumably.  jon stewart  She actually runs a fentanyl dog eating business. It’s one of the few businesses, and it’s drive-thru, so it’s convenient.  kara swisher  No ads here now. Anyway, all right, so speaking of Tucker Carlson, your most famous moment was indeed — you know exactly who he is — on “Crossfire” in 2006, which, it was a long time ago. When you told him, you’re hurting America. It was a big moment for you. And for him and at the time, he really was pushed back on his heels when you did that. What do you think the impact that was —  jon stewart  I didn’t mean him personally. I think it’s become that. But I think that moment has been misinterpreted in a lot of ways.  kara swisher  All right, explain it.  jon stewart  I think people saw it as a plea for civility. And it wasn’t. It was a plea for honesty. I don’t care if people argue or if they get mad at each other or if they are angry. But I don’t like dishonesty. I don’t like dishonest debate. I have a view of the media as an important part of the immune system against authoritarianism and fascism. And against bad governance. But when you set up the polarities of the media to be purely along the lines of a theatrical fight between the right and the left, that’s what I thought was hurting.  kara swisher  How would you deal with him today? Carlson, if you had another encounter with him.  jon stewart  Boy, I mean, he’s very tough to deal with because he understands his own dishonesty. So I don’t think that moment could occur again. I think he’s developed — you know, it’s like jet fighters. They’ll release something that sends a thermal trail somewhere else and then the missile will follow that. I think he’s developed evasive maneuvers, one of them being his, if you say anything that permeates his bullshit, he gets that look on his face like he’s receiving a confusion enema.  kara swisher  Yeah. I can’t explain. You’re doing the Tucker Carlson face right now.  jon stewart  Are you eating dog?  kara swisher  Right, exactly.  jon stewart  Are you taking fentanyl and —  kara swisher  I’m just asking questions, sir.  jon stewart  I’m just asking questions, sir. I mean, the dishonesty is so —  kara swisher  So you couldn’t —  jon stewart  I think it’d be a lot harder, right?  kara swisher  To pierce that.  jon stewart  Yeah, because I think in that moment, he didn’t — he hadn’t quite developed that. He had it to a certain extent even then. But he said himself, when he’s cornered, he lies. By the way lies, when he’s not cornered, too.  kara swisher  Right. You have a show, which we’re going to get to in a minute. But what would be your first question to him if he was a guest, if he agreed to be a guest on your show?  jon stewart  Why did I agree to do this? The first question would be to me. I would ask myself. So that gets back to, I think, the larger point, which is engagement versus non-engagement. Ignorance I think is always important to engage with directly. I have a lot of blind spots and I have a lot of ignorance. And when I — there’s nothing that pleases me more than to have those illuminated.  kara swisher  All right. So in that regard, one of the things you missed, and this was talked about, this idea of disengagement, which you did when you left “The Daily Show” in 2015. You missed all the Trump years. You —  jon stewart  Well —  kara swisher  Did you leave at the exactly wrong moment? I know you joked about it before, but—  jon stewart  No. I mean, yeah, I was — I mean, I was alive. I didn’t —  kara swisher  I get that. I know you’re not dead. I know you didn’t miss it. But one of the things that was important was your voice. Do you think it was — that you disengaged at the wrong time when there might have been an opportunity to get through to some of these people? I’m not saying you’re the savior of all mankind, but you had a very important —  jon stewart  I was going to say almost everything that I believed and advocated for didn’t come to pass and probably got worse. So you could almost say maybe I disengaged at exactly the right time and gave the world a chance. First of all, I think that’s overinflating the importance of a voice, to a large extent. And I would say there was no dearth of people pointing out his hypocrisies and his excesses and his absurdities and his contradictions. And yet, nothing happened. And he would come out and he would say, I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, and not lose any votes. Although, I bet if he tried to vaccinate somebody on Fifth Avenue, he would lose votes. So it really is about — the currency that I was operating in wasn’t effective against that anyway. And I do think at times we confuse cultural power with power. And a clip of — headlined with a click-baity, “Stewart eviscerates Trump’s hypocrisy” — it’s pleasant, it’s a distraction. But ultimately feckless. In a lot of ways what happens with the show is when you’re producing — and I think you probably know this from just being in media — when you have to produce content, there are times when you have to feign engagement or you have to feign an emotional connection and a visceral response to something that you don’t necessarily feel. And when you get to the point where those moments are coming more frequently than you’re comfortable with, when you start to become part of the dishonesty, you have to step back. And you have to remind yourself, like I have to connect to what’s real.  kara swisher  I don’t know. I would have to push back on you.  jon stewart  Sure.  kara swisher  There was actually a column—  jon stewart  Wait, do you have to push back on me?  kara swisher  I have to. I must.  jon stewart  What kind of a program is this?  kara swisher  Going to push back on you. Because I feel like you do have an impact. You and I have. I think Tucker Carlson’s never gotten more powerful by doing his version of engagement. And one of the things — this was a column. I’m sure you’ve read it in Variety. To borrow Stewart’s phrasing during a time when identifying dishonest bad actors was as urgently necessary as any in recent history, Stewart chose to give up on engagement, making his statements now feel hollow at best. I think I did have an impact on people talking about Facebook. I do think —  jon stewart  Well, I — can I push back on that for just a bit?  kara swisher  Sure, please push back.  jon stewart  So What I did was I didn’t give up on engagement. I changed the modality of it. I felt there was a certain impotence to the structure in which I was operating. That there was a recognition of the tricks and gimmicks of it. Look, it’s what John’s done with it and what Trevor’s done. It was time for new approaches. Maybe, too, the DNA might still be there. But I think they created new models of it that could permeate what had become practiced. But let me push back on the other part.  kara swisher  OK.  jon stewart  Because that’s not giving up on engagement. That’s leaving a television show. And what I began to do was engage in the real world in a way that felt more productive to me and more impactful and more satisfying. My wife and I began engaging with a food bank in our area and we got a farm that had rescued — we tried to express our values through action and not talk. You know, a woman named Rosie Torres from a group called Burn Pits 360 reached out because there were a lot of similarities between what we had been dealing with with the 9/11 first responders and community and what veterans had been dealing with. So three or four years ago, we got involved in that. And I found efficacy in being able to use the things that I’ve learned and the whatever cloud I may still possess to elevate those —  kara swisher  Those issues.  jon stewart  Not just those issues, but those individuals. Sometimes it just means a lot to be a hype person for them.  kara swisher  Did you ever think about running public office?  jon stewart  Oh, god. How do you not? When you see the shitheads that are —  kara swisher  Yeah.  jon stewart  How do you not when you watch all that and you’re like, oh my god, what is — this is terrible. It’s like when you get in a car and the one driver’s drunk and you’re like, do you everything about taking the wheel? You’re like, yeah, I did.  kara swisher  So, and?  jon stewart  I don’t know that I’d have the temperament for it, and I don’t know, again, that that would be —  kara swisher  What would be your temperament problem given the politicians we see arrayed before us? I mean, we’ve got Marjorie Taylor Greene. Over here, we’ve got Trump. We’ve got —  jon stewart  Oh, yeah, no. It’s patience with that. It’s having the patience that, how come that person gets to still be here? Make that person leave.  kara swisher  Well, AOC’s done a good job saying that, saying those things like that.  jon stewart  Yes. No, I, listen, I also think there’s a lot that goes around that that has nothing to do with passion or care about issues or wanting to help people, that has to do with fundraising and the way the game is played and the lack of perspective on it. And sometimes I feel like, well, I can be more effective on the outside than on the inside.  kara swisher  So if it’s President Tucker Carlson when he’s running, what are you going to do, Jon?  jon stewart  Oh, Jesus. Don’t even say — that’s just not even —  kara swisher  It’s all over the place. It’s all over Washington. You should ask around.  jon stewart  What?  kara swisher  Yeah.  jon stewart  Why? That’s the worst — that’s terrible.  kara swisher  We’ll leave it at that.  jon stewart  You’re bumming me out, dude.  kara swisher  I’m sorry. I’m sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with Sacha Baron Cohen. And you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Jon Stewart after the break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Before discussing his Apple TV Plus show, “The Problem With Jon Stewart,” I wanted to talk about a problem the internet recently had with Jon Stewart. He came under heat for his comments about podcaster Joe Rogan’s troubles with Covid misinformation on Rogan’s massively popular Spotify show. As the internet was coming after Rogan and Spotify and as famous musicians were leaving the platform in protest, Stewart noted that the rhetoric was, quote, “overblown.” He advocated against abandonment and censorship and for engagement, which seems reasonable. But people did not want to engage with that idea. So I wanted to talk to Stewart about that controversy — if it was a controversy at all — and if nuanced debate is really possible in the age of Twitter.  jon stewart  It’s hard because, unfortunately right now, the real conversations that take place for people aren’t based on other conversations. They’re based on encapsulation and synopses and headlines of those conversations. What we’re talking about right now doesn’t travel in the same way that a headline, “Stewart says Carlson is a traitor” and but — or whatever it is. Or, “Stewart defends blah blah blah” — but that’s what travels.  kara swisher  Yeah.  jon stewart  But it’s not —  kara swisher  Meaningful.  jon stewart  Right. Because conversations aren’t meant to be encapsulated.  kara swisher  Reductive —  jon stewart  It’s like —  kara swisher  — is the word.  jon stewart  It’s so reductive. And it’s like — I’m not a tremendous social media individual. But now that I’m working again, I get a lot of emails. And it’s a lot of, hey, I’ve got those scripts and I’m going to send those over to you. And then I’ll write, thanks. But when I look at it on the page, it looks shitty. Like I’m going, oh, thanks. And so I find myself throwing exclamation points on to like, thanks!  kara swisher  You need to get over that.  jon stewart  What it does is encapsulations in the written word turn the inquisitive into the definitive. Right? So like with Rogan in that situation. So there’s a huge headline, Stewart goes to bat again for Rogan’s misinformation. So that’s the headline. But what it doesn’t say is I wasn’t defending his misinformation, I was talking to an expert in misinformation from the Harvard Shorenstein Center. And I was asking, how do you deal with misinformation? So it was a discussion about that with someone that I thought could bring some authority and some perspective to that conversation. Now that gets reduced to some sort of strange defending misinformation. So now people on Twitter are reacting to, fuck Stewart, fuck that guy for defending misinformation. I’m done with that guy. Fuck that racist piece of shit both sides Stewart. And you watch this thing explode, and it has very little resemblance to what actually occurred. And you realize, the force amplifier that is these aggregators is a far more powerful actor than conversation.  kara swisher  All right, so say then what you said, from what your perspective that then got twisted. Because, you know, “I’ve been misquoted” is a famous tune for a lot of public officials, et cetera. It’s not what I meant. I’m taken out of context. And sometimes we do make fun of them. That’s something you did on the show. You play the whole context. And it was exactly what people thought.  jon stewart  We worked really hard to make sure that the context was correct.  kara swisher  Right. So you thought the outrage was a mistake, correct? Or what?  jon stewart  No. So again, so let’s talk about tone. Right, because that’s important.  kara swisher  Absolutely.  jon stewart  An let’s also talk about where it’s taking place. So we’re on a podcast. It’s a bunch of comics. And Chelsea Devantez, who’s our head writer says, what would you do? These guys, would you pull your music from Spotify? And so it starts off with that, where I’m saying, my music is very, very powerful, and I don’t know that I could pull it from Spotify. It’s that kind of thing. We’re fucking around.  kara swisher  Yeah.  jon stewart  But I said know, I don’t know, I think it’s a mistake. Because I always feel engaged. And maybe that’s fruitless. Now, that’s very different than, this is a mistake. Because it lacks certainty. I didn’t go on there to make a statement of fact that those people were wrong. My opinion was I tend to, maybe to my error or because — or naive, try to engage. I think the one constructive criticism that comes out of it is pulling your music is a form of engagement. And I wasn’t considering that. But that’s not what went wide. What went wide was, goes to bat for misinformation.  kara swisher  Yeah. Did you feel caught up in a tidal wave in a lot of ways or a tsunami?  jon stewart  I mean, I’ve been in that before. And I know like, I’m only caught up in it because the business model of the internet is arson. You can’t make money unless you’re setting fires. In their mind. So the way that the world works now is people have conversations. And within those conversations are small molecules of a lot of potential energy. And then there’s an outer ring of, let’s call them 49ers, that are panning for that gold. Ooh, he just said it’s an overreaction. Now, in the larger department, it was nothing. It was an offhanded comment meant to suggest that I always like to engage, but sometimes that fucking gets me nowhere, too. But boy, when you put that in a headline, it can sound pretty definitive. Now the secondary and tertiary rings, the media-ites and all those others, now they grab it. Because, look they got to eat, too. So now everybody’s trying to eat. So what you’ve done is you’ve taken this thing, you’ve changed the meaning of it to a large extent. You’ve made that now the fact. So rumor becomes fact, fact becomes canon, all through this information and context laundering system.  kara swisher  So essentially, enrichment equals engagement. Right? Correct?  jon stewart  Absolutely. And by the way that’s the 24 hour news model, which is why it’s so destructive. Unless it’s 9/11 or an invasion of a sovereign country. Because now, the gravity of the situation matches the urgency that they gin up. Now the emotional tenor of their work is actually matched by the situation. But in the absence of that, they have to gin up —  kara swisher  To create the noise. To create the noise situation.  jon stewart  That’s right.  kara swisher  So —  jon stewart  So listen, and I’m a big boy and I’ve done this for a long time. And it’s easy to forget. It’s a little bit of like, oh, I haven’t played football in a while, so I just got to get hit a little bit. But I understand that the thing that they’re reacting to is a caricature of me. Not me.  kara swisher  Right. So let’s talk about “The Problem with Jon Stewart.” Not the problem with Jon Stewart, but “The Problem with Jon Stewart.”  jon stewart  What kind of a —  kara swisher  What was a name you would have called it if it wasn’t that?  jon stewart  The real one that I was going to consider is, Why Not? Originally when I thought of it and I was talking to my wife about it was, Why Not? Because it was based in that feeling of, why not? So we played around with that a little bit. And there were a few other titles.  kara swisher  Why’d you dump, Why Not?  jon stewart  It felt too earnest.  kara swisher  How do you like doing it? Because it is earnest. It’s quite an earnest show. I was —  jon stewart  Yeah.  kara swisher  I was surprised. You’ve got your beginning part. Let me explain for people who haven’t seen the show.  jon stewart  All right.  kara swisher  You have a beginning part where you do your Jon Stewart thing with an audience at a Putin-esque desk, I have to tell you. It’s a big desk.  jon stewart  Oh, can I tell you, it’s beautiful.  kara swisher  Is it? I can tell. You touch it a lot.  jon stewart  I’m fidgety.  kara swisher  You’re fidgety.  jon stewart  It’s in place of smoking, so.  kara swisher  But nothing’s on it, so it’s very Feng Shui. Then you do a comedy act, essentially. Observational.  jon stewart  Yeah, like more of what —  kara swisher  Traditional.  jon stewart  —people would traditionally think—  kara swisher  Of Jon Stewart.  jon stewart  Yeah.  kara swisher  And then you have a panel. Because every show is a different topic. And then you do an interview, a big interview. You did Gary Gensler in the one I saw. There’s not a team. There’s not a lot of people. There’s not any stunts beyond it. It’s very different from “The Daily Show.” Talk a little bit about why you did it the way you did this.  jon stewart  Well, all it really is that’s different from “The Daily Show,” and I think earnestness is probably a good thing, but people always viewed satire in this kind of a cynical kind of nihilist, everybody sucks. Which isn’t. I think satire is generally grounded in idealism and hope and earnestness. So all we’ve really done with the show is remove the fictional character who gives you what they really think through an arch perspective. The thing that we all developed at “The Daily Show,” the whatever —  kara swisher  The formula.  jon stewart  Formula that you thought maybe was different was we turned what were more rote monologue-esque jokes that were kind of divorced from meaning into a more essayistic format. It’s turning a punch line into an essay, right? And so for this show, I thought the thing that was missing is, let’s set the table in the same way that I might have done in the old days. Right? And then rather than have a fictional character come on in front of a green screen, let’s have actual people who have an actual stake in these actual issues, and let them talk.  kara swisher  Who you’ve never heard of necessarily, not —  jon stewart  Who you, yeah, generally you’ve never heard of. And then let’s go to somebody who might be able to do something about that and say like, hey, man, how about doing something about this? This is fucking terrible. And, yeah.  kara swisher  Let me just say the people you’re interviewing are surprised, too. I thought Gary Gensler was expecting funny Jon Stewart and got pokey Jon Stewart poking at him. Is that —  jon stewart  Generally, I am pokey Jon Stewart.  kara swisher  I get that. I get that. But it was funny pokey, rather. I’m sure he went back to his PR people and like, what was that? Because you’re like, why do you suck so much, essentially? And that’s what you said. And —  jon stewart  Well, that’s funny. That’s not not funny.  kara swisher  In a way. But I don’t think he was expecting it. When you have the tone, it is — when I say spare, it is spare. And it is serious and earnest. So what are you going for here? I’m having a hard time figuring out what you’re going for. They’re all very good shows. But —  jon stewart  Right.  kara swisher  You have to really pay attention. And they’re substantive.  jon stewart  Right.  kara swisher  What do you think you’re going? Because when I think of everything I make, I’m thinking about what I’m going for. What am I trying? What is my goal here?  jon stewart  Sort of like what I was saying earlier, which is the goal is identify an absurdity or a problem that seems like there’s a solution that could be in the offing. Hear from people that are affected by it, and then talk to somebody who might have the ability to change the calculus on it for the better. Which, to be perfectly honest, that kind of — I always find that question strange. Because we are inundated by shitty content.  kara swisher  Yes, indeed.  jon stewart  And so even if your goal was, I’m trying to not make shitty content, I’m trying to make something that if I think noise is the antithesis of progress. What if we tried to make something that was an equalizer? That tried to bring some clarity to a noisy conversation? In and of itself, I think that’s worthy. So I’m always struck by that idea that — it was like a lot of the critics, they were like, what’s he doing?  kara swisher  It’s vegetables. I saw a lot of that.  jon stewart  And do we need this? And I’m like, there’s five CSIs. What do you mean —  kara swisher  We need those.  jon stewart  How do you gatekeep television and content? What are you talking about? And I understand that I spend my career talking shit. And so you reap what you sow. And that is part of what we do. But I always find the self-justifying aspect of it a little odd.  kara swisher  So what would be successful to you and what’s successful, say, to Apple? What do they — illumination?  jon stewart  Oh, well, those are very different things.  kara swisher  All right, OK.  jon stewart  Those are very different things.  kara swisher  I mean, why did you pick Apple over, say, Comedy Central, where ratings obviously are a big deal? Apple — who knows? They made more money from an iPod yesterday than you’ve made your entire career.  jon stewart  Yeah. But they would let me do what I wanted.  kara swisher  Right. That’s why you went with them.  jon stewart  Yeah. And it felt entrepreneurial in a way. And I also wanted to create this podcast. We wanted to try and create a universe of information, where we were boosting some of these voices and figuring things out. It’s entrepreneurial to some extent. But also within that, what Apple gets out of it — I’m not sure what they want out of a content company. I really don’t. And in some ways, we might be antithetical to their business model.  kara swisher  Honestly, I think Apple wants to sell iPhones. I think Amazon wants to sell toilet paper.  jon stewart  Right. But that’s what I mean, that it may not be in their interests to have a provocateur. But I do know they’ve been incredibly supportive and have given us the resources to do it. And I think when you think about what’s success, success is not just about its impact in the world. It’s also about its impact on the people you work with. And their sense of satisfaction and growth and engagement. And I really want to make something that I feel like we’re challenging ourselves to - not to co-opt a phrase from my benefactors, think differently. But to look at issues not from the polarity necessarily of —  kara swisher  Or in the immediate. Or in the immediate. Because topicality is hard. Because everyone’s thinking about Ukraine right now and you have a show on the stock market of a story that was a couple months ago. You focused on one, something I’ve been quite tough on, which is Robin Hood. How hard is that, to get people’s interest when that’s the case?  jon stewart  Oh, that I don’t know. So the one thing you can never do with content is try and figure out if someone’s going to be interested in it.  kara swisher  Right.  jon stewart  Like, you —  kara swisher  Well, you rush a Ukraine episode. You certainly could. You could. You know people are paying attention to Ukraine. You could rush one of those episodes out.  jon stewart  So one of the things this is also about, one of my frustrations with the media, is it’s eight-year-olds playing soccer. So where’s the ball? So there’s this sense that there’s only one story in the world. But the stock market goes on, whether Ukraine — what’s the first thing they say? Russia has invaded Ukraine, and what will this mean for the stock market?  kara swisher  Right, right. Yeah, yep.  jon stewart  So not climbing on the moment I think is an advantage, not a disadvantage, for the types of things we want to talk about.  kara swisher  Right.  jon stewart  I like to think of themes, and one of the big themes for me is that we are told that we live in a free market capitalist society. And everything that I see tells me we are not. If you give corporations access to the money hose, that’s stimulus. But if you give people access to the money hose, that’s socialism.  kara swisher  Right.  jon stewart  This one is about if you turn on the news, you will see the stock ticker and the Dow Jones Industrial, and you would be reasonable to assume that, OK, this is — I better pay attention to this, because this is obviously the pulse and blood pressure of the American economy. But it’s not. It’s in no way indicative of it. In fact, it’s an utterly skewed version of what is the actual economy. Those numbers that you see are owned by a small — 10 percent of the country owns 80 percent of those assets. It’s just skewed.  kara swisher  What you’re trying to do here is quite substantive in topics that are not. If we were in a culture that is so twitchy and reductive, which is I think you described well, how do you break through? Because Tucker Carlson, getting back to him, has been very successful in being reductive. Can you be successful in doing what you’re doing, which is vegetables in a lot of ways? Perhaps delicious vegetables, but in that way, it is.  jon stewart  So I’m a firm believer that you develop an internal barometer of morality and quality. And you work with people who will be honest, who will tell you tough things that you need to hear, and will try and keep as clear and eye on that vision of funny, smart, thoughtful, interesting, as we can. And fair. But it is also reductive. Comedy is, in its purest form, an incredibly reductive — we are purveyors of bigotry. Everything we do is, hey, men, you — women do— And you could be the king of disclaimers. Women, I got to tell you — I mean, obviously, not all women. But a lot of — I mean, women love to shop. I mean, there are certain women obviously in different economic stratas that would have a difficulty in terms of gathering. But in general, I guess what I’m saying is upper middle —  kara swisher  That’s the woke, unwoke comic you just did.  jon stewart  Women, yeah. That’s going to be my next special. But I think one of the beautiful, frustrating things about creating something is it is no longer yours when it leaves your purview. And it’s why you have to work with the people you work with as well as you can to create content that best exemplifies the intentions that you wanted to put into it and are the right recipe of fun and interesting and smart and thoughtful as best you can do. But when it goes, it goes. And how that breaks through or how it’s received is no longer within your control.  kara swisher  So you took over “The Daily Show” in 1999 when Bill Clinton was in office. Facebook wasn’t a thing. Fox News was only a few years old. When you’re coming back, is it fundamentally different now? So do you think about making things as fundamentally different?  jon stewart  No. I don’t — I mean, part of it is my brain is maybe not as elastic as — technology to me is still an alien force. So that part didn’t change. And the elements of what you’re talking about now were there when I left. They might not have been there to the same extent, but they were certainly there. I mean, I find the only thing that really has changed is you have to be more cognizant. A lot of times, we have a young staff. And they’ll say, that thing you said, that’s going to cause a problem. And I’ll say, is it a is it a problematic thing? And they’ll say, well, I don’t necessarily think it’s a problematic thing, but I know how it may be taken. And then I’ll have to say either, all right, well, let’s do that. But what I try and tell them is, you can’t outsmart the mob. Because the mob exists in so many different — every interest group has a mob. People say, is there a cancel culture and a woke culture? But in truth, the internet is just a random wandering of a variety of mobs. Every interest, everything you have, has people who want to engage honestly, people who want to engage with interest, people who are open, and villagers with pitchforks and torches. So the right has it, the left has it. Music has it. Comedy has it. It’s a feudal system.  kara swisher  So when you look at this, has — I don’t mean to say has time passed you by, but you were talking about it differently. You were talking about it differently.  jon stewart  That’s quite a throwaway. Has time passed you by?  kara swisher  You have the Twitters, the Facebooks. All this stuff has gotten this enormous power and enormous damage. And you’ve got a population that’s addled and streaming and getting all kinds of stuff in it. Can you catch their attention? A lot of your stuff reminds me of Tom Snyder. There’s all kinds of shows I see in this. Charlie Rose with 100 percent less sexual harassment, for example. But has — that should be your tagline. What do you think? Will Apple like that? No.  jon stewart  Yeah. Well, let me address the first thing first, which is, has time passed you by? Yes. Time passes all of us by. I’m not going to pretend that I’m not 60 next year. We had a moment on “The Daily Show.” The kind of moment that is beautiful and surprising. And it was a moment that came. I was already 35, 40 years old. So it was one that I could really appreciate. But what I appreciate more than any of it is the opportunity to have lived a life, a creative one, that I never thought would have been possible. And in the moments when I was working for a plate of hummus down at the Comedy Cellar and walking home and down to Canal Street at 3:00 in the morning and just looking up at the sky and thinking, I’m the luckiest motherfucker around. And I don’t think I’ve ever lost that. I don’t have a yearning to be, I guess what you would consider on top or relevant. I’m grateful that my mind still works the way it works and that there’s people that are willing to let me explore topics and do things that I think are worthwhile. And there’s streaming and technology and all these other things. But maybe that means there’s also still room. In some ways, I feel like it’s a better pursuit now than it was before. But I also would say, what’s my choice? Is your choice then to not make things? If you think to yourself, the world has passed me by and it’s like — and by the way, you get that online. Shut the fuck up, go away.  kara swisher  Yeah. Yep.  jon stewart  But they’re not — why would I listen to them? Why wouldn’t I continue to make things if I am allowed to? And by the way, if Apple didn’t allow me to, maybe somebody else would. Or now with the democratization of content, maybe you end up back at the cellar working for hummus and still — because ultimately, it’s a pursuit of expression.  kara swisher  Yeah, 100 percent. Jon Stewart on Substack. I see it. I see it.  jon stewart  Patreon. I’m going to go OnlyFans.  kara swisher  Anyway, Jon, this has been great. What an interesting discussion.  jon stewart  I’ve enjoyed it, Kara. Thank you. It’s very, very nice to meet you. [MUSIC PLAYING]  kara swisher

Alexander Vindman was three when his family fled Ukraine to build a better life in the United States. In the four decades since then, Vindman has been an officer in the U.S. Army, studied Ukrainian affairs at Harvard, and served as a member of the White House’s National Security Council specializing in Eastern Europe. And it was in that last role that America came to know Vindman’s name.  archived recording (alexander vindman) On July 25th 2019, the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the situation room with White House colleagues. I was concerned by the call. What I heard was inappropriate. And I reported my concerns —  jane coaston  He was the first White House official to testify about the July 25th call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, a call that would lead to Trump’s first impeachment.  archived recording (alexander vindman) It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.  jane coaston  After Trump’s acquittal, Vindman was fired from his job at the N.S.C., and he retired from the Army the following year. He has an absolutely singular perspective on what is happening right now in Ukraine — what we can expect, how we got here, and maybe most importantly, what we’re still getting wrong. [MUSIC PLAYING] Alexander Vindman, welcome to “The Argument.”  alexander vindman  Thanks for having me on.  jane coaston  First, how are you doing? How are your family and friends in Ukraine?  alexander vindman  So I have friends there. But fortunately, I guess under the circumstances, I don’t have any close family. All the close relatives have emigrated. We came as refugees. But friends, it’s tough. I had some conversations with some friends this morning, dealing with the circumstances as best they can, firm resolved to continue to stay there, whether they’re working nonprofit side or just trying to live their lives. And then, of course, the folks in government absolutely resolve to keep the country intact, sovereign and independent.  jane coaston  As you said, your family were Jewish refugees that fled Ukraine. You’ve spent your career studying Ukraine and Russian relations. You spent time in the military, significant time in the military and in the White House. And you were on the record early saying that an invasion was likely when other people were saying that it wasn’t or that it was impossible or that U.S. intelligence was incorrect, even as much as five days ago.  alexander vindman  Yeah.  jane coaston  So what has surprised you most about the events of the past week?  alexander vindman  Well, it’s interesting. I got to say that I did feel like at times, you know, when you make some weighty calls like that, you feel like you’re out on a limb. And I kept questioning and hoping I was wrong, frankly.  jane coaston  Right. This is the kind of thing where being right sucks.  alexander vindman  Yeah. Being right sucks, and I felt it was more important to really try to get the U.S. government to pay attention and take early steps to avoid it rather than preserve my credibility, which, frankly, is why people so often head to their analysis. Because they don’t want to be wrong on something like this, and then what they say is questioned. But it was too big. It was in my face. It was coming. But I’m not Nostradamus, and I have been off on a couple of things. But what is amazing, what is shocking is the flawed assumptions of the Russian government. The Russian military is not incompetent. They’ve proven themselves in smaller contingencies. They’re professional. They’re exercised, which is different than being well-trained. But they’re pretty well-exercised. But they were operating on this very, very flawed assumption, that they would face little resistance, they may be welcomed in. And it looks like they rolled in as if they were going into a peacekeeping operation into a training area instead of rolling into combat. And the resistance that they’re faced is fierce from all across the country. We’ll find out eventually how much of this is designed and how much of this is fortune. But I would imagine there’s quite a bit of design from the Ukrainian side. They didn’t fight every inch. They let the Russian forces funnel into major cities, many, many miles away from their logistics, many, many miles from safe haven, and then stalled them and started to destroy Russian forces, and then punish the supply lines to maintain those forces in the fight. And that’s something that is both a massive misjudgment on the Russian side. And the fierce resistance from the Ukrainian side is not something that I think anybody really counted for. And that includes me, because I did actually think about resolve and the willingness of the Ukrainians to fight. And I thought that they would put up a valiant fight, but this is a whole different scale. It’s a long way to go. And it’s a really, really precarious situation. It is day by day, hour by hour. But you can almost see Ukraine leaving this war with its sovereignty and independence intact, which is hard to imagine when facing, by all accounts, the second most powerful military in the world. And this is all them, by the way. This is not like other allies coming in. This is Ukrainian fighting on their own. They’re getting equipment now, probably later than they should have. They’re taking more losses than they need to, but they’re getting it. And they’re going to be able to sustain themselves probably. Question is, what does Russia do?  jane coaston  Right. This seems like it has not gone at all the way that Putin may have wanted. You’re seeing these tank formations, these long columns of tanks that are breaking down, just lacking fuel. So as you said, it did look like they either expected to be coming in welcomed. They expected to be coming in so quickly that there would be no defense. There have been a lot of people talking about how this is a different Vladimir Putin. Marco Rubio tweeted this weekend, “we are not dealing with 2008 Putin.” There’s been a lot of conversation about that. And I don’t like doing remote psychology, but can anyone be confident in our assessments of his decision-making? And what’s different about the version of Vladimir Putin that invaded Georgia, that took the region of the Caucasus, and this Vladimir Putin, in your view?  alexander vindman  So let me start with talking about some of the military operations. Because we shouldn’t underestimate the Russian military.  jane coaston  Absolutely.  alexander vindman  That’s dangerous.  jane coaston  Right.  alexander vindman  We should not underestimate him as a paper tiger and discount them. Because their capabilities are advanced. They’re definitely underperforming, but I think a lot of that has to do with the political leadership. This is just my analysis. What we’ll likely find out is that Putin gave explicit guidance on doing at least a light touch on the cities. So initially, the aerial bombardments and the cruise missile strikes were on military targets and not on populated areas. That’s now shifting. So that’s the political leadership’s fault. On the military side, they’ve clearly been way too rigid. So those airborne operations were intended to go in uncontested. In fact, that was clear almost immediately that the Ukrainians were going to resist, and those forces were annihilated. But we also see that the Russian military operates in a consistent way, where they seem to realize that there is no appetite from the Russian population for anything more than a peacekeeping operation, or at least it wasn’t before. They did not want to communicate to their soldiers that they were going into a hostile environment in Ukraine. And the POWs that are being captured consistently say, we were on a field exercise, then we were pushed across the border as peacekeepers. And they were not expecting a fight. A lot of them didn’t even know that they were going into Ukraine until they arrived in Ukraine, which is shocking. From a Western military perspective, to not share that kind of stuff, to not prepare your force for combat, would be the highest form of negligence. So that’s on the military front. But for Putin, I’ll tell you that Marco Rubio frankly doesn’t know what he’s talking about. It’s kind of frustrating to watch him spout off. What we would call as, you know, like secret squirrel. He’s got some secret information that he’s sharing the most watered down version to indicate that he’s in the know as some sort of political tool. But it’s kind of meaningless, except for the fact that could be significantly misinterpreted. For Vladimir Putin, over the course of his tenure, he’s become increasingly belligerent. He thought he had Russian power on a side to achieve influence in his region. He tried to muck around in Ukraine’s elections, resulting in the Orange Revolution in 2004. Then he started to use his military force because economic coercion wasn’t working. Political coercion wasn’t working to retain a sphere of influence. So he went to war in Georgia to substantiate that Russia deserves a sphere of influence. And over the course of the next, more than decade, he’s been increasingly, increasingly aggressive with little response. And the reason he did that is because he just wasn’t facing significant opposition. He basically believed that there was a lack of resolve to face up to him. And really, what we see unfolding today is a combination of both a deep misconception of the West to defend its interests, because it was inconsistent to say the least in the past, and then a deep misunderstanding of Ukraine’s independence and willingness to resist, and all of these things coming together into a huge, huge trap for Vladimir Putin. He’s consolidated the entire free world against him in condemnation and inaction. So that’s the sanctions that are unfolding, and these weapons provisions that are unfolding. And that’s something that ultimately, he might be remembered for, both this horrendous war, but also for bringing the democratic world together in defense of our values.  jane coaston  And you’re seeing it from unexpected places. A colleague of mine, Peter Baker, tweeted that “in almost every way, Putin seems to have achieved the opposite of whatever he ostensibly wanted.” There are more American troops back on the continent. The West is more united. You’re seeing Luxembourg and Switzerland getting involved, which if anyone’s paid attention to world wars, Switzerland getting involved is a pretty big deal.  alexander vindman  Yeah.  jane coaston  So what should the United States be doing now? We see broad support for sanctions. We see broad support for the types of economic means that are taking place right now. What should happen now?  alexander vindman  So first, we should probably understand that this is still early days. And Russia is getting deeply frustrated. And all of that seeming restraint is going to evaporate. We see that today already unfolding with bombardment against Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, with a population of almost 1.5 million, a beautiful city that’s just minutes away from Russia’s border. And the Russians have been attacking it for five days with little success. And now they’re starting to press with MLRS — Multiple Launch Rocket Systems — and stuff like that and aerial bombardments. And they’re going to start using things like thermobarics, which are like firebombs and fire-based kind of artillery, to put it in layman’s terms. And these are going to inflict significant casualties and collateral damage. And of course, they’re also doing this nuclear saber-rattling, which we need to keep in mind. The nuclear saber-rattling shouldn’t be completely discounted. Of course, we need to be mindful of it, mindful of what it means for the regime that Putin feels like he’s getting backed into a corner and that he needs to make these kind of warnings. But we should also be mindful of the fact that there is deep precedence for this kind of behavior. There is deep precedence for the Soviet Union and Russia and for Vladimir Putin, who’s a Cold Warrior with a deep memory of the Soviet Union and the Cold War. The use of this kind of nuclear saber-rattling, it’s a deterrent. It’s meant to signal both a seriousness, but it’s also meant to achieve an outcome. It’s supposed to make our minds in the West race to the worst case scenario and self-deter. So the things that they can’t accomplish through force, they could accomplish through coercion. We need to be mindful of it. We need to take the proper posture. We need to make sure that we’re serious. But we also can’t simply buckle on the things that are so dear to us, because now this is not just a fight between Ukraine and Russia. This is a fight between good and evil. This is a fight between democracy and authoritarianism. And right now, the ability to kind of roll back sanctions is going to be contingent on Russian actions. It’s not going to be contingent on Russian threats. You asked what we should be doing now. We should be locking down the sanctions. We’re basically almost at the limits of sanctions. We’ve gone a long way, but they’re still able to accumulate resources through the trade of oil. But if we develop alternatives, we could probably sanction that and really crater the entire Russian economy. It’s really devastating, and that’s why the markets haven’t opened. That’s why the ruble is at an all-time low by a wide margin. And then on the military side, I think it’s important to point out the kinds of things that are critical and deep need by the Ukrainians. So they actually need something as basic as helmets and body armor. They’ve had tens of thousands of people volunteer. And they’re not equipped to provide body armor and helmets to these new civilians that are now going to take up arms. So they need that kind of stuff. They need more anti-tank capabilities, because the Russians still have more resources. They need more air defense capabilities. So these stingers — the U.S. is now providing them directly, which behind the scenes, I’ll tell you, this is something that I thought we should have done a long time ago. I was advocating for it in government. And again, I was getting those quizzical looks. Why? And my response is because the Ukrainians are going to need them. But we’re past that now. We need to drop these incremental approaches that are intended for kind of peacetime environment. We’re in a new Cold War. And we need to flip the switch. If the Ukrainians are asking for resources, we give them these resources. We’re not parochial about, oh, we don’t know if you could use this capability. If they say they want it, and they’re fighting, and we’re not — they’re the ones that are bleeding — we give them what they want. That’s where we need to provide some additional help.  jane coaston  I wanted to ask about the economic question here, because we’ve seen Russia’s economy go into freefall before in the late 1990s. And as the ruble destabilizes, my concern here is that putting the Russian economy into freefall makes Putin all the more powerful in some ways. If everything is going wrong for Putin, doesn’t the nuclear option become more attractive when you have him trapped in a corner, so to speak? Does that make him more of a risk?  alexander vindman  The answer is yes. The answer is absolutely yes. But that’s because Putin started a war. This is why I was jumping up and down about doing more to avert this, not waiting until after the war started to start sanctioning, but doing some graduated options along the way to signal a seriousness. In hindsight, when the history books are written, we’ll have discovered that we fell well short of what we could have done to avoid this. We’re now in it. And because there’s a war, the risks have increased. But what are our options? Think about from the U.S. perspective. Are we on the ground? No. Are we providing substantial material support? No. We have no place to go. Our alternative is to apply pressure on Europe. And of course, we played a significant role on the sanctions front. That’s not to be negated. But there is not much room for us to kind of backpedal. We don’t have a lot of room to reverse course. And we can’t do it under our fear of Russian provocation. What we need is some clarity and some signaling from Russia that they’re prepared for off ramps. Because we can start getting into our own heads and start offering things that may be meaningless. We will be negotiating ourselves, which is everybody knows is the worst thing to do. Now what we need to do is we need to keep signaling the fact that we’re open to conversations. We’re open to some different discussions. That is a door that Putin could choose to walk through, but we absolutely cannot negotiate against ourselves. Because we don’t know what’s going to be effective. As soon as Putin indicates that he’s realized that he’s not going to be able to achieve his military objectives, that the base of his support within his population is crumbling, which is not clear yet. There are protests, but we’re not there yet. But he’s ruled for this long on, really, the basis of two promises — one is no war, and the other is stability with some economic prosperity. Now he’s failed to deliver on both. He’s basically brought around the worst thing that Russia’s experienced in many decades. It may very well end up being worse than the troubled ‘90s, as they’re known. So it is a very, very difficult situation that Putin’s putting himself in. He’s definitely getting backed into a corner. And our job as a US government is to indicate that there are ways out of this thing. It’s not going to be what he wanted. It’s going to be far from his maximalist solution. He may even have significant reversals. Even those Russian controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk might very well have to revert back. So it’s something that’s much, much less. But I guess, I’m giving you a bit of an optimistic view that we’re past this. Russia has an enormous amount of combat power. And it’s going to get brutal, and this fight is going to get real, real ugly. Ukraine is still outmatched in terms of capability. They have much, much greater morale, which accounts for a huge amount of the success on the battlefield. But it’s not a done deal, and Ukraine needs all the support we can get.  jane coaston  I’m curious. How is Twitter and social media changing the conflicts? We’re seeing videos and comments being taken out of context. But it almost feels like Russia’s losing control of the misinformation, disinformation war on the internet.  alexander vindman  That’s another really interesting question I’ve been thinking about for a long time. So what was interesting that we saw unfold over the weeks preceding Russia’s war is every time Russia was preparing to conduct an information operation or some sort of attack or a provocation, the U.S. very, very quickly declassified the information and allowed the media to kind of magnify it. It’s been highly effective. You have the U.S. closing off options for Vladimir Putin, undermining his ability to indicate that Russia is fighting a just war, which is required for his own population, and undermining the pretext for war. And that is going to be something that we learn from and carry forward. On the information and disinformation stuff, we’re in the fog of war. I’ve been victim too, a couple of these types of things. I pick up on something, and I do what I guess I’ve always done. I take some personal risk and don’t look to protect myself to the maximum extent. I just try to get information out. And that’s going to result in some mistakes. But we’re in the fog of war, and I’ll take the hits.  jane coaston  So let’s talk a little bit about the domestic implications of the invasion. Most people know you from your testimony in President Trump’s first impeachment trial, which was, of course, about Ukraine. Thinking back on that phone call you observed between Trump and President Zelensky in 2019, how do you think back on that call now, knowing what’s happened?  alexander vindman  It really does put everything in a whole new light. So it was always about national security. For me, there was no political angle, whatsoever. It was always about national security. It was always about the inevitable conflict of Russia against Ukraine, Russia seeking to retain control of Ukraine, to pull Ukraine back into its sphere of influence, and Donald Trump, undermining U.S. foreign policy, U.S. national security. Because I understood that this would be really dangerous for the U.S. for Russia to conduct a large war against Ukraine, and that the Ukrainians needed to be armed to defend themselves to deter Russian aggression. And when Donald Trump basically froze — I mean, not basically, when he froze security assistance, he was sending a signal to Vladimir Putin that it’s OK to attack Ukraine, that the U.S. isn’t resolved to protect Ukrainians’ interests, that Ukraine is isolated, that Ukraine is vulnerable. That sent a signal to Vladimir Putin, kind of incrementally adjusting his calculus. Is this opportunity real? Because the needs always have been there, right? He started this war in 2014. The need to hold Ukraine back in was there it’s the opportunity that was unclear. And initially, he started to take the temperature checks certainly under the Trump administration. With the Ukraine scandal and the president’s corruption and abuse of power, when the Senate failed to hold Donald Trump accountable, that opened the aperture for opportunity. By the time you get to the insurrection, that’s it. That was probably right about the decision point. He knew that he wouldn’t have Donald Trump as president. He knew that he wouldn’t have Donald Trump willing to break NATO. There’s wide reporting now that Donald Trump was keen on pulling us out of NATO. So that’s what Putin was looking for. And in the absence of that, the insurrection was probably — I mean, we’ll see. These things will have to get declassified eventually. But I think that was a big tipping point, because he saw an immense of vulnerability in the United States. He assessed that the U.S. was distracted, enfeebled, paralyzed, that the U.S. wanted to focus on long-term confrontation with China and was looking to normalize the relationship with Russia. And that’s when he started to build up. That’s clear. He started to build up in the spring of 2021. And that this operation has been planned for more than a year. And he was taking the temperature of the Biden administration. And he is seeing if he could extract concessions from the Biden administration. There was a summit in December 2021. He started ratcheting up the pressure. And last thing to mention on this domestic politics, we are a superpower. What we say matters. What we say is meaningful, not just domestically, but around the world. And when Fox News, when Donald Trump, when Mike Pompeo, when Tucker Carlson encouraged Vladimir Putin, encourage Russia, that’s meaningful. That’s meaningful, because it again opens the aperture of opportunity. It’s what drives Putin’s calculus to conduct this operation. And it’s what undermines deterrence. So when President Biden talks about powerful sanctions coming, when we start providing assistance to Ukraine in the December-January time frame, counterbalancing that are these anti-Americans. Because they’re fighting against American national interests. That is what ultimately takes us to the point where Putin was already thinking in that direction. He sees the opportunity. Deterrence is undermined. And I imagine that somewhere, we’ll learn that he gave a go order, maybe even weeks ago. And we’re putting the last pieces together.  jane coaston  I’m curious as to your thoughts on that, because we have seen this seemingly rapid change of opinion from a large swath of the — what I would call kind of the anti-anti-Putin right, where it’s so much so anti-Biden and so much anti this administration that it becomes supportive of Putin —  alexander vindman  Yeah.  jane coaston  — this idea that he is secretly very strong and secretly very wise, which goes back to Trump and goes back to this idea of a strongman. But I do want to know like, what influence do you think that those viewpoints will have? They’re not the majority, to be clear, among Republicans.  alexander vindman  Yeah.  jane coaston  But what influence do you think they will have on American interventions? And how does anti-war sentiment play into what America does next?  alexander vindman  So let me start with saying that this is a moment for unity. This is a moment where we need to invite the Republicans, even the ones that were denouncing Ukraine days or weeks ago. It’s time to invite them to redeem themselves and to provide support to defend U.S. national security interests. This is the moment. But I could also tell you that there will be a reckoning. It’s like these folks, for some reason, missed all the telltale signs of the fact that they’re walking into an ambush. And that’s what they did. They walked into an ambush. They were touting and elevating and idolizing Vladimir Putin days, hours before the attack. And they’ll pay. They will pay for that at the election booths, absolutely. Because they own it. I explained that Vladimir Putin was taking the temperature check to figure out if this is something you could do. And they gave all the signals, so they have blood on their hands. This war is on Putin, but they are in part responsible. And they will be held accountable. I think it’s hard to not see every channel, including Fox News cover this. And this may be a way that it starts to lift the fog of Trump and Trumpism. At least I hope that it’s the case. I think this is actually a turning point maybe for us too. [MUSIC PLAYING]  jane coaston  We have this tendency sometimes, as Americans, to make everything about us. And to see everything as being secretly about us, that like Russia invaded Ukraine, because people use gender neutral pronouns. Can you de-Americanize this conflict? Is this as much about us or Trump or Biden or Obama’s action or inaction in Crimea, which is a separate point that I think is interesting about whether that gave Putin some sort of a green light in some way? Is this as much about American involvement and America as we think it is? And can you help me calibrate the degree of responsibility America should have in this conflict?  alexander vindman  So it is not about us. It is not about us. We help explain the why now, not the why. The why is between Russia and Ukraine, between Russia and the Western world, between Russia and the fear of democracy. It’s the Ukrainians’ desire and drive towards democracy and Western integration and a lifestyle that is responsible for this conflict. It’s the clash of two ideologies. Putin cannot accept the perpetual fear and danger of a thriving Ukraine on his border because the population would inevitably say, why do we not enjoy those freedoms? Why do we not enjoy that prosperity? That’s the direction Ukraine has been consistently heading in. And with regards to Donald Trump and Biden, I wouldn’t say Biden was weak. I’d say Biden was resolved and firm in defending U.S. interests and values. But he also was probably a bit myopic. Because we have 20 years of bilateral relationships that caused the administration to look at this relationship through a soda straw, so the options were limited. And the things that we were open to doing, even five days ago, were much, much more narrow than they are today. But President Biden deserves a lot of credit within the bounds of U.S. foreign policy of 20 years for holding the line and for now stepping up and doing the right things. I think there’s more to do. I think at the end of this, Ukraine is going to need — again like, this is just to show orders of magnitude. There was a supplemental request for I think $6.4 billion. Multiply that by 10. That’s what it’s going to take to rebuild Ukraine. That’s what it’s going to take to realize a Western Ukraine that’s earned its place, I think, amongst the great nations of the Euro-Atlantic alliance. Now let me deal with this Trump nonsense. Because it is ridiculous, this idea that somehow, he would have prevented this war. Yes, he would have prevented the war because he would have attempted to give away Ukraine. He would have ended NATO, and Russia would have unleashed a long-term hybrid warfare that would have probably, ultimately culminated in a military confrontation anyway. We’re in this situation where there is a major war in Europe. He contributed to that in a major, major way, and he owns that.  jane coaston  So is this the beginning of a strategy by Putin to attempt to forcibly recreate the Soviet Union? We see the language that he’s using about what he believes Ukraine to be, that he does not recognize Ukrainian identity? Do you think that Ukraine would be enough for him? Is there an endgame here, especially if it’s not about Ukraine? There’s been this idea like, oh, Ukraine bullied Russia, which no, no. I can read a map. I understand how bullying works, but that Ukraine is Russia, and that all of this is Russia. With that in mind, what is the end game?  alexander vindman  So it’s interesting. I mean, there’s a lot that we could learn from history. Frankly, the reason the Soviet Union looked the way it did with these 15 republics is in large part because of Ukraine and Georgia. There was a strong nationalist sentiment as in sense of self, sense of language, sense of culture. And Lenin had to accommodate that. And instead of recreating a communist empire, he established a Soviet Union to allow for space for that. Vladimir Putin is not interested in that kind of enterprise, at least, not ultimately. And it’s hard to understand where he wants to end up. But he certainly wants Ukraine under his thumb within his sphere of influence. There is a small chance that he could have rolled in as a peacekeeper, put in a puppet regime, and rolled out. That was his objective. And that puppet regime that would slowly kind of migrate Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence on the template of this like union state that Belarus and Russia have established, where it continues to get closer together until boundaries become so muddled and so transparent that it’s basically one state. So that’s part of the enterprise, because for Vladimir Putin, his ideology is greater Russia, followed by little Russia, which is Ukraine, followed by Belarus. But it likely doesn’t end there, because if he’s successful in establishing that core, then irredentism and his desire for power would continue to manifest with acquisitions in Georgia at minimum, who’s been a thorn in his side. I mean, in the worst case scenario, Ukraine could still fall. It would be a catastrophe. But it would fall in a way where Russia would have to maintain forces and conduct counterinsurgency operation for years. That would be supplied by European allies. So slowly but surely, they’d be probably bled white. It’s not what he had envisioned. Under all situations now, it doesn’t end the way he had conceived.  jane coaston  It seems like this is in Russia and for Russians, a lot of people are referring to this invasion as a gamble. How big of a risk do you think he’s taking here, especially domestically? I mean, there have been at least 6,000 people arrested in protests across Russia. This war is incredibly unpopular. You’re hearing rumblings of objection in the Duma, oligarchs sort of speaking out. You’re seeing the oncoming crash of the Russian economy. The ruble is at an all-time low. Do you think that he underestimated the degree to which this invasion would be unpopular? Or do you think he cared at all?  alexander vindman  I don’t think he cared that much, but that was another major miscalculation. You make decisions based on assumptions. A fundamental assumption was that the Ukrainians would roll over. A fundamental assumption was that the West would be weak in its response. A fundamental assumption would be that the Russian population would take it, because security services and repression of dissent. Those are three massive, massive miscalculations. Part of that is that he’s been so insulated and unaccountable to anyone that there had to be people that understood that this would be unpopular or that it wouldn’t be a cakewalk with regards to Ukraine or that the West wouldn’t come back with some serious repercussions. But these are fundamental assumptions. And I think this is the beginning of the end of Vladimir Putin. What we haven’t started to bake in yet, and what the Russian public hasn’t start to bake in, is this devastating human toll. This is the fact that Ukrainian cities are being bombarded. Civilians are being killed. And if, in fact, there are 4,500 Russian dead and those body bags start coming back, or mothers start to ask about their children, that’s going to be untenable. That is going to cause shockwaves in Russia. It’s an earthquake for Russia that potentially reformats Russia in a different direction.  jane coaston  I think my last question for you is, everything is a breaking news headline right now. I will not lie to you, I also have Twitter open. Because I was joking with our producers, like something is going to happen while we are doing this. And we’ve already seen horrifying news of the bombardment of Kharkiv.  alexander vindman  Yeah.  jane coaston  What is the thing we should be focusing on? We’re going to be getting so much information and misinformation over the next hours, days, weeks. What should we be focusing on?  alexander vindman  Yeah. So I’ll tell you that we’re in the fog of war. We’re not going to be able to get it all right all the time. I think, unfortunately, we need to get ready for a world where there are a lot more civilian casualties. There’s going to be more nuclear saber-rattling and threats. Because Putin, we have to remember, has not faced serious opposition for 22 years. His mind is kind of locked in into a particular direction. Now he’s facing it. And his instinct is going to be to double down. So we’re facing an acute situation. But our fight or flight reaction, we need to fight that urge to flee. Because the stakes are too high here. If we don’t hold our ground here, we are setting ourselves up for even more serious confrontation down the road that doesn’t have to do with Ukraine, something closer to home. And what we need to remember is that there are precedents for this. He’s not suicidal. He’s not a madman. He just needs to be recalibrated. And that’s what is going on here.  jane coaston  Is there anything else you want to tell me? Anything else that you think is important for our audience to know?  alexander vindman  I would just lastly say, my thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people that are living this. They’re fighting for their homes. It’s tough to think about that, tough to think about the personal cost. But there are millions of people under threat right now. And they’re fighting for our values and our interests. Sounds hokey or something, but I think we’re all Ukrainians at the moment. [MUSIC PLAYING]  jane coaston

And thus I discovered the real instigator of Europe’s worst conflict in decades: Karens.  “We have these people called ‘Karens,’ and they’re able to become angry at the drop of a hat,” said Lionel, an American conspiracist and right-wing pundit who has frequently contributed to Russia Today. In an interview with an RT anchor, Lionel — who, like Madonna, goes by one name — suggested that the collective denunciation of Russia’s actions in Ukraine was as unhinged as demanding to speak to the manager about some minor customer-service flap: “We are being conditioned to overreact to everything — and this Ukraine situation is no different,” he said.  Honestly, it was kind of sad. One does not expect much sophistication from Russia Today, the Russian government-funded television and internet outlet that has long been a haven for conspiracy theories and populist, anti-Western propaganda. Yet I was not prepared for the ineffectual clownishness of some of the arguments that RT has lately floated in defense of the invasion. And that was when RT mentioned the attack at all — many times in the past week I found the network mostly ignoring the present crisis and instead showing reruns of a grievance-laden documentary about Ukraine’s history originally aired in November.  The overall impression has been one of surprising flat-footedness. Although Putin has been obsessed with Ukraine for decades and, according to U.S. intelligence, has been amassing forces for this invasion for months, Russia’s premier international mouthpiece appeared to be caught off guard by the incursion. It’s as if its programmers had actually believed Russian officials’ recent denials of any plans to invade.

We are still waiting for you to issue that executive order.  In the State of the Union you didn’t once say the words “Black” or “African American,” “white” or “Hispanic.”  Race, as a word, magically disappeared from your rhetorical repertoire. Why? I assume because the political winds have shifted. What polled well last spring isn’t polling well this spring.  Even when you mentioned increasing support for historically Black colleges and universities, you used the acronym, H.B.C.U.s. Minor? Yes. But I noticed. By the way, the best way to help the graduates of H.B.C.U.s would be to use your executive authority to cancel more student loan debt, since, according to the Education Data Initiative, Black college graduates owe an average of $25,000 more in student loan debt than white graduates.  Student loans were not mentioned in your speech.  You did hail your Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, even if you didn’t point publicly to the historical significance of her being the first Black woman nominated. Her blackness — and the history of exclusion on the court — was left unsaid in the grand chamber.  Minor? Maybe. But again, I noticed.  Some might say that simply because Jackson is Black, it was enough to mention her name, without directly addressing Black people and their interests in the speech. But it doesn’t work that way. Symbols, representation and inclusion are important to me, sure, but they are no substitute for policy and legislation.  This is not to disparage Judge Jackson’s nomination in any way. It is exhilarating. She is qualified and should be confirmed, and she will be an inspiration for many as well as a needed voice for another perspective on the court. Thank you for nominating her.

People dropped dead on the streets. Ukrainians ate dirt, grass, food waste. Reports of cannibalism were widespread, and parents were said to have eaten their children. About 3.9 million Ukrainians perished in what became known as Holodomor — “death by hunger” in Ukrainian. But killing them wasn’t enough. As a final insult, Stalin, who was infamous for erasing enemies from photographs, forbade talk of the famine and ensured statistics were altered to hide the deaths, as if his victims had never existed.  Less than a decade later, the Nazis seized Ukraine. Some 1.5 million Ukrainian Jews were killed, most by mobile Nazi death squads known as Einsatzgruppen, aided by local collaborators in what later became known as the Holocaust of bullets. Babyn Yar, just outside of Kyiv, became the final resting place for 33,000 Jews mowed down in just days. Destruction was not limited to the Jews. Cities, including Kharkiv, were reduced to swaths of rubble. Over two million Ukrainians were pressed into slave labor in Germany. Hunger descended again. In all, because of war and famine and destruction, five million to seven million Ukrainians lost their lives. Nearly 200,000 Crimean Tatars, Muslims who lived in Ukraine for centuries, were deported to Central Asia; tens of thousands died as a result.  The end of German occupation didn’t end the suffering, it only brought renewed Soviet repression. The U.S.S.R. couldn’t abide any identity that challenged Soviet dominance, whether in individuals or nations. For 40 years after the war, Russia methodically swept aside the Ukrainian language and culture, leaving behind a landscape of soulless Soviet kitsch, red stars and slogans and tomes of speeches by Lenin. Ukrainian identity was vestigial and subservient; I still remember my school showing us drawings of peasants in vyshyvanki — traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts — insipidly smiling while waving Soviet flags.  The Kremlin also suppressed Holocaust remembrance, which it saw as potentially dangerous because it facilitated Jewish communal identity. For decades, the bodies of hundreds of thousands of Jews remained strewn in Nazi killing pits throughout Ukraine without so much as a grave marker. When the regime did permit memorials, the dead were invariably referred to as “peaceful Soviet citizens,” their Jewish identity purposefully omitted.  When I was still a child, in 1986, an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant spewed a radioactive cloud through Ukraine and Belarus. Heroic local volunteers and firefighters put out the radioactive inferno, preventing a second explosion that could have decimated half of Europe; many died horrific deaths in the process and in the aftermath. A large area of land was rendered uninhabitable and remains so today. Moscow stifled discussion of Chernobyl as it happened, cloaking the accident in secrecy and propaganda.  Three years later my parents, my grandmother, my sister and I — along with thousands of other Soviet Jews — fled for Vienna. It was from America that we watched, in 1991, as the Soviet Union crumbled and the Iron Curtain was drawn back. Ukraine gained its independence, but promises of democracy were soon mired in endemic corruption.  In 2004, the Orange Revolution saw hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians reverse the outcome of a fraudulent presidential election. In the winter of 2013-14, millions joined the Euromaidan uprising, demanding that Ukraine enter into a partnership agreement with the European Union. Shortly after, Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula while Russian-backed separatists launched an anti-Euromaidan uprising in the east of the country.

Many Russians must be starting to worry that as long as Putin is their present and future leader, they have no future. Thousands are taking to the streets to protest Putin’s insane war. They’re doing this at the risk of their own safety. And though too soon to tell, their pushback does make you wonder if the so-called fear barrier is being broken, and if a mass movement could eventually end Putin’s reign.  Even for Russians staying quiet, life is suddenly being disrupted in ways small and large. As my colleague Mark Landler put it: “In Switzerland, the Lucerne music festival canceled two symphony concerts featuring a Russian maestro. In Australia, the national swim team said it would boycott a world championship meet in Russia. At the Magic Mountain Ski Area in Vermont, a bartender poured bottles of Stolichnaya vodka down the drain. From culture to commerce, sports to travel, the world is shunning Russia in myriad ways to protest President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.”  And then there is the new “Putin tax” that every Russian will have to pay indefinitely for the pleasure of having him as their president. I am talking about the effects of the mounting sanctions being imposed on Russia by the civilized world. On Monday, the Russian central bank had to keep the Russian stock market closed to prevent a panicked meltdown and was forced to raise its benchmark interest rate in one day to 20 percent from 9.5 percent to encourage people to hold rubles. Even then the ruble nose-dived by about 30 percent against the dollar — it’s now worth less than 1 U.S. cent.  For all of these reasons I have to hope that at this very moment there are some very senior Russian intelligence and military officials, close to Putin, who are meeting in some closet in the Kremlin and saying out loud what they all must be thinking: Either Putin has lost a step as a strategist during his isolation in the pandemic or he is in deep denial over how badly he has miscalculated the strength of Ukrainians, America, its allies and global civil society at large.  If Putin goes ahead and levels Ukraine’s biggest cities and its capital, Kyiv, he and all of his cronies will never again see the London and New York apartments they bought with all their stolen riches. There will be no more Davos and no more St. Moritz. Instead, they will all be locked in a big prison called Russia — with the freedom to travel only to Syria, Crimea, Belarus, North Korea and China, maybe. Their kids will be thrown out of private boarding schools from Switzerland to Oxford.  Either they collaborate to oust Putin or they will all share his isolation cell. The same for the larger Russian public. I realize that this last scenario is the most unlikely of them all, but it is the one that holds the most promise of achieving the dream that we dreamed when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 — a Europe whole and free, from the British Isles to the Urals.

I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.” Every tool will not be enough if Biden is as committed to stopping Putin as he says.  I don’t want to suggest there’s symmetry here. The pain the United States and Europe can inflict on the Russian economy dwarfs any feedback effects. Measured in G.D.P., Russia’s economy is smaller than Italy’s, and it is one-fourteenth the size of the United States’. But the exemptions tell the story. For all Biden’s resolve on Tuesday night, he did not try to prepare Americans to sacrifice on behalf of Ukrainians in the coming months, if only by paying higher prices at the pump. Instead he said, “My top priority is getting prices under control.” That’s the tension Putin is exploiting.  At the same time, it adds force to the agenda Biden laid out in the rest of his speech. “Economists call it increasing the productive capacity of our economy,” Biden said. “I call it building a better America.”  There are parts of Biden’s agenda that, if passed, could help to lower prices for families, rapidly. Medicare could negotiate drug prices next year. Child care subsidies could take effect quickly. There is no resource limitation stopping us from lowering Obamacare premiums. The same cannot be said for Biden’s more ambitious proposals to build the productive might and critical supply chains of the United States. To decarbonize the economy and rebuild American manufacturing and lead again in semiconductor production is the work of years, perhaps decades. It won’t change prices much in 2022 and 2023.  But it needs to be done, and not just because of Russia. Covid was another lesson, as America was caught without crucial supply chains for masks and protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic and without enough computer chips as the virus raged on. And while I don’t like idly speculating about conflict with China, part of avoiding such a conflict is making sure its costs are clear and our deterrence is credible. As of now, whether we have the will to defend Taiwan militarily is almost secondary to whether we have the capability to sever ourselves from Chinese supply chains in the event of a violent dispute.  Biden devoted a large chunk of his speech to his Buy American proposals, which economists largely hate but voters largely love. As a matter of trade theory, I’m sympathetic to the economists, but as Russia is proving, there’s more to life than trade. You could see that in an analysis done by The Economist, which has long been one of the loudest voices arguing for the logic of globalization. “The invasion of Ukraine might not cause a global economic crisis today, but it will change how the world economy operates for decades to come,” it wrote. Russia will become more reliant on China. China will try to become more economically self-sufficient. The West is going to think harder about depending on autocracies for crucial goods and resources.  This was, in the end, the unfulfilled promise of Biden’s speech. Russia’s invasion and America’s economy were merely neighbors in the address, but no such borders exist. And connecting them, explicitly, would bring more coherence and force to Biden’s agenda.

The man was a murderer, it was said, but when I asked about the crime, he smirked and said he was framed. I remember his shoes, pointy and shined like glass.  I published a lot of articles as Moscow bureau chief for The Los Angeles Times, but this is one story I never wrote: About the problem that began with that 2008 interview and unfolded gradually over years — slowly enough to create the illusion that nothing was happening.  Russian power has a tendency to work that way. You detect a suggestion of a threat, but then it just lingers, unrealized, until finally you shrug it off. What I learned reporting on Vladimir Putin and his Russia is that, maybe sooner but more likely later, it will happen. And once it does, you think: Just as promised, nobody made a secret of it.  In 2008 there was speculation about a war in Georgia, and then it came. The bombing had hardly quieted before a new rumor moved through Moscow: Ukraine is next; he’ll take Crimea. The Russian military invited reporters on a junket to Sevastopol. We saw Russian graves tended by Russian priests, a Russian guided missile cruiser, Russian tourists on every corner of what was then a Ukrainian city. The sea had swallowed centuries of Russian blood; the sun was clear and bright. It was hard to write the story afterward because nothing actually happened. It was only a message: This place is rightly ours. Six years passed before Mr. Putin seized the peninsula.

You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays.  Over the weekend, as his military laid siege to Ukraine for the fourth day, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear forces into a higher state of alert, the first time the Kremlin has done so since the Russian Federation was established in 1991.  “This is unprecedented in the post-Cold War era,” Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington nonprofit, told NBC. “There has been no instance in which a U.S. or a Russian leader has raised the alert level of their nuclear forces in a middle of a crisis in order to try to coerce the other side’s behavior.”  Since the end of the Cold War, it has been easy enough for most people to disregard the possibility of a nuclear attack; the conflict in Ukraine has thrust it back into view. How troubling is Putin’s escalation, and in what ways might the prospect of a nuclear exchange shape the outcome of this conflict? Here’s what people are saying.  What does Putin’s order mean?  Russia and the United States control 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. Those weapons can be delivered by aircraft — as were the two atomic bombs that the United States used against Japan in World War II — or via submarine- or land-based missiles.

Before being forcibly brought to Boston, Onesimus seems to have lived in West Africa, where inoculation was a common practice. There, he had been deliberately infected with a small amount of smallpox to make him immune from a more severe version.  In Boston, Onesimus told his owner, Cotton Mather, about the practice. Mather was among the colonies’ most prominent religious leaders in the 1720s. He was also keenly interested in science, as Burns told me when we spoke recently. Today, science and religion are often considered antithetical, Burns noted, but past religious leaders were scientific pioneers.  When smallpox began spreading in Boston in the 1720s, Mather campaigned for residents to be inoculated — and was met with fierce criticism and even an attempt to bomb his home. Some Bostonians argued that inoculation violated God’s will. Others, including doctors, argued that it was folklore that would do more harm than good.  These arguments were powerful because inoculation was so counterintuitive. Mather was claiming that people could avoid getting sick … by getting sick.  Modern vaccination is somewhat less counterintuitive, because drugs can now teach the immune system to respond to a deadly virus, without having to use small amounts of an actual virus. But vaccination is still a strange notion. It involves the injection of a mysterious cocktail of foreign substances into the human body.

Dennis Duncan will be here to talk about his book “Index, A History of the.” What happens when a violinist’s recently discovered Stradivarius goes missing? Brendan Slocumb will be here to talk about his debut novel, “The Violin Conspiracy.” Plus, my colleagues and I will talk about what we’re reading. This is the Book Review Podcast from The New York Times. It’s February 26th. I’m Pamela Paul [MUSIC PLAYING] Dennis Duncan joins us now from North London. His new book is called “Index, A History of the.” Dennis, Thanks for being here.  dennis duncan  Thank you so much for having me.  pamela paul  I guess British people would say, “A History of the.” And some Americans. That sounds much better. But either way, it is such a brilliant title. And I need to know at what point in the process did you come up with it? Like did you even just start with that title and say, this should be a book, because it’s such a great title?  dennis duncan  Well, it came about halfway through. The idea actually was that I was going to write an academic book— a dry, scholarly book that would come out with an academic press and be sold primarily to libraries. At some point along the way, I published a little bit of journalism about it. And there was some real interest from trade publishers who said, “You could make this into a trade book.” So the difference between the way this would look as an academic book and how it looks now is just slightly turning up the levels on the characters and on some of the anecdote. And I think once that was OK— once I thought, oh, right. You know what? I can write this for a broader book nerd audience, if you like. Then I can be a bit more playful. And then the title occurred to me. So the title occurred sort of halfway along through the process.  pamela paul  Well, there’s a lot of play in this book. I would imagine it would be hard to suppress the playful parts, if you had to write a dreary academic book. Your previous book, “Book Parts,” which you edited, cataloged all the various parts of the book, from the dust jackets to the index. Was it obvious to you that— OK, this is the one I want to take and grow into a book?  dennis duncan  Yes, it was. In fact, I’d already been doing more with the index. When Adam and I put together “Book Parts,” Adam Smyth and myself, we knew some colleagues who were working on other things. So Adam had already done quite a lot of work on errata lists, and I was already thinking about indexes. And so, we got hold of people who had specifically done work on dust jackets or title pages. You’d be amazed, there really are academics who have these as their specialism. So it wasn’t that I cherry-picked a chapter, having done “Book Parts.” It was that I was already thinking about indexes specifically.  pamela paul  That’s just an interesting sentence in and of itself. I mean, what— why were you thinking about indexes? What is your area of research generally? You are a lecturer in English at the University College London. How does one come to specialize and be interested in indexes?  dennis duncan  I lecture in literature, in English literature. But my Ph.D. was on French literature. And particularly, it was about a group formed in the 1960s in Paris called the Oulipo. They are a group of writers, mathematicians, chess players. Marcel Duchamp was a member. And they would think about ways of introducing ideas from mathematics or constraints into the production of literature. So notoriously, a member called Georges Perec wrote a novel in 1969 that doesn’t have the letter E.  pamela paul  Right. Quite the challenge in French.  dennis duncan  Exactly. Yeah. So this is an interesting way of thinking about narrative. And some time, maybe about 10 years ago, it just occurred to me that several novels by the members of this group— there’s this Perec’s masterpiece, “Life: A User’s Manual.” There’s also a book by the American member of the group called Harry Mathews, called “The Sinking of The Odradek Stadium,” and Italo Calvino’s last novel, “Mr. Palomar”— they have indexes. This is really unusual. Novels, as we know, tend not to have indexes. Indexes are the kind of marker, if you like, between fiction and nonfiction. Nonfiction has an index. Fiction doesn’t. So what was it about the way that this group think about narrative that led them to playfully include indexes in several of their novels? And I thought, well, I’ll do an academic article on this. And in order to do that, I will need to find out a bit more about the history of indexes. So I assumed naively that there would be a history of indexes. And I asked my colleagues, “Where do I go? What’s the standard history of indexes?” And the answer kept coming back— “I don’t know, I’m afraid.” So it turned out there was a gap. Somebody needed to do this. Somebody needed to helpfully, for future literary endeavors, write the history of the index. And I thought, right. I’m going to fill that gap. But I do like the idea. I mean, this bibliographic book, which you very kindly say is quite playful, comes out of thinking about the most playful literature. Books like Perec’s books, like Calvino’s, that are about playing with what the novel can be.  pamela paul  Why did they use indexes in their novels?  dennis duncan  Well, I never got to write that article. But it’s a really good question. I think partly, when you’re taking ideas from mathematics in order to structure your narrative, the narrative becomes— well, becomes unusually structured. It’s not free-flowing imagination. It’s more like writing a novel as the solution to a crossword puzzle that you’ve set yourself. Queneau, the founding member of this group says that the Oulipo rats trying to escape from the maze of their own creation, so you set yourself up a puzzle, and then you have to write your way out of the puzzle. And it turns out, I think, that that mode of narrative production lends itself to what we might think of as kind of micro-narratives— things, small incidents happening in text. Because each of these is the solution to part of the bigger problem. So the index becomes kind of a useful way of marking these points of solving the narrative problem.  pamela paul  It didn’t catch on, though, in fiction. I mean, I don’t think— well, footnotes have had real popularity in fiction in recent years. I don’t think that’s happened with indexes after this group.  dennis duncan  No, that’s right. And when you get indexes in fiction, they tend to be markers of a certain kind of playfulness. They tend to be fiction that’s pretending not to be fiction. So Virginia Woolf’s “Orlando” has an index. Nabokov’s “Pale Fire” has an index. Both of these are novels that pretend that they’re not novels. “Orlando” pretends that it’s a biography of Orlando. “Pale Fire” pretends that it’s a scholarly edition of a poem. So the index is there as part of that kind of cross-dressing, part of that pretending that this novel, this fiction, is something else. What you find actually is in the very early days of the novel, before the novel settles down— so we’re talking about the mid-18th century— you do find indexes to fiction. Samuel Richardson writes an index for “Pamela.” He writes an index for “Clarissa.” These are really early novels, before the idea of what a novel should look like. Because it kind of settled down before we reached the sort of golden age of classic Victorian realist fiction, by which point, everybody knows that fiction doesn’t have an index. And it takes somebody like Lewis Carroll, in the 1890s, to start playing around with that. Lewis Carroll has an index for his last novel, “Sylvie and Bruno.” And in doing so, he’s playing a joke. He’s being kind of Carrollian about what a novel should look like. You know that they shouldn’t have indexes, but I’m putting one in playfully. There is another category of novel that does have an index though, and that’s the uber classic. So people have produced indexes for Jane Austen, for the novels of Walter Scott, for Proust. And this is to do with the way that we use those novels— those uber classics. Usually, when you read a novel, you read it in a linear way: You start at the beginning, you read through to the end, then you take the book to the charity shop or put it on your shelf. And you don’t revisit it. And an index is like a road sign. If you have a long straight road with no exit, you don’t need any road signs. But when you have a book that you know you’ll be returning to, I know that I’m going to want to look something up in Jane Austen’s “Emma” or something like that, because it’s so famous, because it’s such a classic, that we return to it. Then we do need to know, what are my points of entry? Where do I find that bit? So like I say, Proust, for example, has an index produced for it. “Lord of the Rings,” people have produced indexes for it. So it’s to do with the way that we use books. If we’re going to return to something, like a reference book, like a history book or like a very, very classic novel, then there is a point in having an index.  pamela paul  I actually liked uber classic better than very, very classic novel. Did you just make that up or is that a word that’s used in the U.K.?  dennis duncan  I think I might have made up uber classic. [LAUGHTER]  pamela paul  When did the first index come about? What was the first index, and where did this happen?  dennis duncan  It comes about around about the year 1230. So we’re talking about the start of the 13th century. But what’s really interesting is, it’s invented twice at the same time. So it’s one of those inventions, like the light bulb or like mathematical calculus, that the moment is so ripe for it, that two people in separate places invent it. So the index gets invented once in Paris and at the same time in Oxford. And there are very slight differences between what these inventions look like. The one that’s invented in Paris is invented in the Dominican friary of Saint-Jacques. And it’s what we would call a word index or a concordance. The friars at Saint-Jacques took the Bible— great big collective endeavor within the friary— and they broke it down into its constituent words, and then they put them in alphabetical order. And said, here are all the instances where this word can be found. The first one, they’re talking about the Latin Bible. The first word alphabetically in the Latin Bible is— it’s actually a phrase. It’s A, a, a, which translates loosely as “alas.” And it occurs four times in the Latin Bible. And they work their way through to Zerubbabel, a name, I think he’s a judge in the Old Testament. So breaking the book down into its words, breaking the Bible down into its words and pointing to all the moments they occur. The other time it was invented, also round about exactly the same year in Oxford, was by a man called Robert Grosseteste. Now, Grosseteste was an absolute polymath of the Middle Ages. He had read philosophy. He’d read the Bible, the scriptures, the church fathers. He was interested in science. He was very interested in lenses. He wrote a book on rainbows. He’s a total, total polymath. He’s not only read Christian writers, he read Greek writers. He’s also dabbling in recent Arabic philosophy. And with an intellect like that— this completely encyclopedic intellect, he needs a way of cataloging it, essentially. Where do these ideas occur? So Grosseteste draws up a list of about 440 topics, ideas. It could be religious ideas, like the idea of the Trinity, the notion that God exists. And every time in his reading he sees this topic mentioned, he does a little sign in the margin. So 440 little signs, they look like emoticons. And if you run your fingers down the books that Grosseteste used, some of his books still survive in various libraries. You can go and look at his actual copies of these books. You see these streams of emoticons running down the margins. Then what he could do was go back to these books and put together all of the moments that that particular sign exists. So where are all the instances that God exists? Well, Genesis One, in the beginning, God created heaven and Earth. Well, that means God exists, so I put a reference to that and all of the other instances from St. Augustine, even from Platonic thought. So he has what we call a subject index. It’s an index not necessarily where a word occurs, but every time a topic or subject occurs. The other thing about Grosseteste’s index is that, it’s not limited to one book. He doesn’t just break down the Bible. His index is like a search engine. It’s like Google. He’s read everything. And he’s made a note of wherever any of these ideas that you want to look up occur in the vastness of his reading.  pamela paul  So what you’re saying is the British system was more sophisticated than the French one?  dennis duncan  [LAUGHS] I’m not saying that. And I think it’s the French system that really caught on. When you’re working with documents today, if you’re working with a PDF file or a Word document or you’re scrolling through a web page, and you hit Control F to find the string that you want to find, you’re really doing what those French friars were doing. So I think we’re coming into an era of the concordance now, the way that we do text search now. So I don’t want to be partisan about the British system.  pamela paul  All right.  dennis duncan  The French one was very good too.  pamela paul  So did they continue— the French version continued as it was along those lines? And in Britain, it was using this more subject-oriented kind of index?  dennis duncan  No. You find that the national barriers don’t really exist. So we find concordances in both cultures, we find subject indexes throughout Europe, really within a few decades. So by the end of the 13th century, you can find books not just in France but all over that use— both types of index. So they really sort of catch on in both ways. The thing that really kick-starts the thing or gives the thing an enormous boost, though, happens about 200 years later. We’re still talking in the 1200s. Every book is a handwritten copy. So if you have a copy of St. Augustine, and I have a copy of St. Augustine, you might have a really big book. I mean, just takes up a lot of space on your shelf, whereas I might have a really small but thick book. So the person who’s copying it out copies the words exactly, but they’re not sticking to the pagination. So if I say, you’re really going to enjoy what’s on Page 64, that doesn’t work in the manuscript era. It’s only with the invention of print in the 1450s that we can really be on the same page, that we can start to produce indexes that use page numbers as standard locators. You can be in New York, I can be in London, we can have a friend in Venice, and we can email each other and say, Page 116, you’re going to love that, and know that as long as it’s the same edition of the book, as long as it’s come off the presses at the same time, that will work. So things like footnote referencing, but particularly things like index referencing, really come into their own in the middle of the 15th century with the invention of print, which standardizes the page.  pamela paul  And is it completely standardized across cultures, across different print traditions?  dennis duncan  My book has a very kind of Western lean to it. There’s research being done by American academics, though, on the index in other cultures, in Chinese culture for example, where it arrives quite late. I think in the late 19th, early 20th century, and part of that is to do with alphabetical order. One thing that the Roman alphabet is very good for is memorizing alphabetical order. There’s only 26 letters. And we can look something up in the left hand column of an index, because we know that ordering system. If you move to a new geographic alphabet, that becomes a lot more difficult. Now in the late 19th century, the Chinese became interested in Western medical textbooks, which were being translated. But in order to be useful, you need to be able to look something up in these sort of medical textbooks. So the index comes into its own, and that causes a problem for these books’ usefulness in cultures where you use a different alphabet. And so, I’m not the expert on this. I have to confess. But I understand that what’s called the four corner system of putting the symbols of Chinese writing into an order, so you can look things up in an index, comes in round about the early 20th century.  pamela paul  All right. I’m going to stay in the 20th century, and actually go into the 21st, so skipping over hundreds of years of index history, who now creates the index in a book? Is that a job? Are there people that specialize in indexes?  dennis duncan  It really is. There are professional societies in this country where I am, in the U.K., we have the Society of Indexers. In the states, you have the American Society of Indexers. There’s a Canadian society and Australian, New Zealand society, a Dutch society. Yep. There are professional bodies of indexers. And these indexers will have specialist expertise. I talked about medical textbooks. You don’t want your medical textbook indexed by somebody who doesn’t understand medicine. You don’t want your science textbook indexed by somebody who doesn’t understand that, because it won’t be useful. They won’t get the nuance. When I did a book, you mentioned “Book Parts” earlier. When Adam and I did “Book Parts,” a lot of it is set in the Renaissance. And it involves quite a lot of Latin, so we got an indexer who would be able to spot that, the Latin, to get those things correct. In the index, if you’re doing a gardening book, similarly, plants have both botanical names, Latin names and common names. And you want somebody who’s good on gardening to do that. So yes, you have professional indexers. Lots of academics think they can index their own book and come a cropper, because it’s really hard. And the professionals are sort of trained in trying to project, what is somebody who comes to this book? How are they going to use it? What are the things they’re going to want to look up? What are the ideas here? Now, I say that indexing is a profession. It’s done by these specialist humans who have a real capacity for deep reading, for A) understanding the book, and B) thinking how is this book going to be used. There is also software to produce indexes, as you can imagine, using rudimentary artificial intelligence. But it’s not very good. At the moment, the state of the art for commercial indexing packages isn’t very good. So in my book, I’ve included two indexes. I’ve included one—  pamela paul  I was going to say, you’re giving away the ending to your book!  dennis duncan  [LAUGHS] It’s fine.  pamela paul  Go ahead.  dennis duncan  I’m going to tell you anyway. One that I produced by using this commercial software, and I wanted to show, it’s interesting. It’s not as bad as you think, but it’s also not very useful. And another produced by a lady called Paula Clarke Bain, who is a professional indexer over here. And it’s a masterpiece. Paula’s index is not only conspicuously, substantially more useful than the one produced by the software, but it’s also funny. It’s full of Paula’s personality. Paula is trained to be a crossword setter, a cryptic crossword setter. And it’s got all sorts of anagrams and little bits of Paula’s personality, which I think mirror the humor hopefully of the book there. She’s done a job of representing, hopefully, the playfulness of my writing in her index. So hopefully, that really shows the difference between current state of the art in computerized indexing software and a really good human indexer.  pamela paul  So very last quick question: Excluding your own index, your own Paula-generated index, not the computer-generated one, do you have a favorite index?  dennis duncan  Oh, I have a few. There’s a really good one from 1929. It’s from a book called “The Stuffed Owl,” which is a poetry anthology. Early 20th century poetry anthology, but of bad poetry. It’s an anthology of all of the moments where the great poets— Wordsworth, Shelley, Coleridge, have written really rubbish lines. And its index is really snarky. Its index is full of— index is a great way of sort of burying snark. There’s something about the brevity of index syntax that makes it a good place to be sarcastic. And so, “The Stuffed Owl” is this wonderfully sarcastic index poking fun at the greats of the English poetic canon. I think that’s my favorite.  pamela paul  All right. We will end there with the owl. Dennis, thank you so much for being here.  dennis duncan  A pleasure. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]  pamela paul  So here’s a request for our listeners.

He is the author of a debut novel called “The Violin Conspiracy.” Brendan, thanks for being here.  brendan slocumb  Thank you so much.  pamela paul  So congratulations on the book, which was a Good Morning America February Book Club pick, very big deal right out of the gate.  brendan slocumb  That is insane. I’m just— I’m blown away.  pamela paul  So you are coming to this as a second profession. You are a classical violinist. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you came to play and study the violin?  brendan slocumb  When I was 9 years old, the orchestra program in Cumberland County, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Susan Ellington came around to all the elementary schools and said, yeah, we are offering strings lessons— violin, viola, cello, bass. Anyone who wants to take lessons— the lessons are free, you just have to rent an instrument. A couple of my friends said, yeah, I’m going to do this, because we would to get out of class twice a week. So I was definitely, definitely down for that. They ended up not doing it. And I ended up doing it. And it just was a life-changing experience.  pamela paul  What appealed to you besides the obvious getting out of class?  brendan slocumb  [LAUGHS] It was the fact that it was something new. And I had heard a little bit of classical music before that day, and I loved it. I just absolutely loved it. It was something new and exciting. And it just resonated with me.  pamela paul  Do you currently play with an orchestra?  brendan slocumb  I do. I play with the Nova Symphony in Annandale, Virginia.  pamela paul  And you also teach violin. You said that learning violin helped save your life in other interviews. Tell us a little bit about that, and then I’m curious if you find yourself mentoring other young aspiring musicians who may have been in a similar place that you were.  brendan slocumb  To answer the second part of your question first, I hope so. I hope that all of my interactions with not just musicians but with people in general, I hope that they are inspiring and uplifting. Just the smallest gesture, you never know how it could change someone’s life. But in regards to music saving my life, when I say it’s a life-saving force, that’s not hyperbole at all. When I was younger, I didn’t live in the greatest neighborhoods. My family and I, we had each other. And the friends that we would play with and run around with, a lot of them today are in prison or dead. And had I not been in my music classes, had I not been on a trip with my orchestra, had I not been practicing, I would have been right there with them, breaking into people’s houses or stealing things and just getting in trouble. So music really did save my life.  pamela paul  When and why did you decide to write a novel on top of what sounds like a very successful and fulfilling career as a classical musician?  brendan slocumb  It was the events of 2020. With the pandemic, you’re stuck in the house all day long. And in addition to that, the events that took place involving George Floyd. I think that the time was right for people to really receive the stories that I had been carrying around for years and years and years. In 2020, we were all stuck inside. There’s nothing to do but eat or write, so I decided I’m really getting fat, so I should probably start writing more, and “The Violin Conspiracy” was born.  pamela paul  Well, not just stories that you’d heard about, but also things that you’ve perhaps experienced in your own life, in your own career as a Black classical musician.  brendan slocumb  Absolutely. I would say 99 percent of the events that take place in the book are either directly from my life or modified events from my life. People would say things like, “That didn’t happen. No, no, no, you’re exaggerating. Uh, come on, you’re like— no, no really. That doesn’t happen.” But they do, and they did. And I felt that the time was right for people to actually receive these stories, just to let them know that, hey, there’s a different perspective out there. It’s not just what you see and what you think. Other people have different perspectives. And their perspectives, although different, doesn’t mean that they’re any less valid.  pamela paul  Give us some examples. What is one of those stories that you would tell people, and they would just say, no, no, no that’s not possible.  brendan slocumb  Wow. The wedding scene in “The Violin Conspiracy,” a modified version of that event took place with my quartet when I was in college. The quartet played at a wedding, and we thought everything was fine. And the father of the bride got us out of the church as quickly as possible, didn’t pay us, saw hatred in his eyes. And he told us that we ruined his daughter’s wedding, and we still tried to figure out why until certain things were said. And we knew exactly what he was talking about. And it was just a devastating feeling. And the other big event was Baton Rouge, the Baton Rouge scene. I was driving cross-country with a friend back in 2000. This is pre-GPS, so we had to use road maps. And using the road map, I was in the right lane, but the hotel was on the left side. So I had to make a left turn. I put my left turn signal on, got over. Nobody on the road, mind you, because it’s like Sunday evening. And two seconds later, there’s a cop pulling me over and my passenger, my friend was white. And he’s in the car. He’s like, “What’s going on?” He’s like, “Well, here we go. It’s about to— it’s about to go down.” “What are you talking about?” He’s like, “Just wait.” The cop gets on his bullhorn, tells me to get out of the car, just me, just the driver, get on my knees, hands in the air. And he’s got a gun drawn on me. And I think that this is it. I’m done. This is it. And he comes up and tells me, after he looks at my ID, that I can go because it was just an illegal lane change. And I was like, you have got to be kidding. You draw a gun on me and make me get out of the car on my knees for an illegal lane change, are you serious? And had my passenger not been in the car to view it, people just wouldn’t believe it. “No, that’s— you’re over-exaggerating.” Really? Yeah, things like that happen.  pamela paul  So you take some of those true stories and then obviously, this is a novel, it’s fiction. How much of a leap was it to come up with story? Because this is also, we should say, a thriller, so there’s very much— it’s very plot driven. How did you come up with the idea?  brendan slocumb  Again, that was really easy to do. Because the whole premise with the stolen violin, that also happened to me when I was a senior in high school. We came home from a family trip and my violin, I actually make reference to it in the novel, my 1953 Eugene Lehman violin was stolen along with a bunch of other stuff that I didn’t care about like appliances and TVs and radios and whatever in the house, and the violin was gone. And if your instrument is taken, as a musician, it’s like a part of you is missing. I felt like I was missing a limb. It was right before I was supposed to go to college. It was supposed to take me through school, and I had nothing. And it was a devastating experience.  pamela paul  All right, before we get to the fictional violin which, we should say, is a Stradivarius in the book, what was the story behind your own instrument? How did you get it? And why did it mean that much to you?  brendan slocumb  That violin, that 1953 Eugene Lehman that I had— oh, and by the way, if anybody’s listening, and you see a 1953 Eugene Lehmann, I would love to have it back. That instrument— that was the first one that I owned outright. First one that was paid for, and it belonged to me. And it was mine, and I was so proud of it. And it was a fantastic instrument. It was actually sold to me by one of the teachers in the county that I went to school in. He saw that I had some talent, and I needed a better instrument. And he sold it to me at a really, really, really good price. And my mom scrounged up the money to buy it. And I was really happy to get it. I loved it. I love that violin. To this day, I think about it. It’s just an empty sinking feeling when I don’t have that instrument.  pamela paul  Wow. There’s not a happy ending there, or did you— I’m assuming you got another violin. What was— did it not fully take the place of that original in your heart?  brendan slocumb  Well, this is a really interesting thing about it. This is why I really want people to understand the power of music and what it can do for you. A patron, someone in the county who had an old fiddle in their family for years and years and years and years that wasn’t being played, heard about my story. And they offered to let me use their family instrument through college. So this wonderful patron gave me a violin for four years as I went to college. It was a nice instrument. It wasn’t as good as my Lehman, but it was something, and I appreciated it. And it took me through school, and it gave me an opportunity. So I feel that it’s really, really important. I will always do everything I can to give back, because that opportunity was given to me by someone.  pamela paul  Let’s cross over to the world of fiction, because some of this is mirrored in the story of your protagonist. Tell us about Ray.  brendan slocumb  Ray is an everyday, just— he’s a nice kid. He’s a little bit dorky, but he is a really cool guy. He’s dorky and cool, because he plays the violin. But that’s the only thing that people would consider dorky about him. Good guy, just wants to play music. That’s all he wants. And people don’t necessarily understand that about him, because you don’t see a lot of Black teenagers who want to play violin and pursue it as a career. So they think it’s a little bit odd. It’s not odd, it’s just who he is, and I wanted to write Ray as the person who stays true to himself. He’s got a lot of good influences in his life. He does run up against a lot of adversity, but the positive role models in his life really, really shine a good light on him. And you could tell that their influences come through in the character of Ray.  pamela paul  All right. For those who have not read the novel yet, just set up the basic premise of what happens to Ray at the outset of the novel. We don’t want to give any plot twists away.  brendan slocumb  OK. “The Violin Conspiracy” is basically the story of Ray, who discovers that his old family fiddle is actually a priceless Stradivarius violin. And that discovery catapults him into superstardom in the world of classical music. And right before the Tchaikovsky competition, which is basically the Olympics of classical music, his violin is stolen. Will he get it back? Will he compete? Will he win? You have to read “The Violin Conspiracy” to find out.  pamela paul  All right. You said you wanted people to understand the power of music. What did you most want to convey in the novel about the violin and the experience of performing? And how did you do that?  brendan slocumb  I really want people to know that, that music, in general, it’s such a powerful force. It’s such a saving force. It can do so much for so many people. As a teacher, I’ve had kids come into my classes who are basically outcasts in their other classes. Teachers say they have a lot of trouble with them. They’re not doing well in any of their classes. They have home problems, and they can’t get along with anyone. But they’ll come into my class, and they’re a part of a family. We all support each other, and music really does that for you. Music is one of the only things that you can experience that you can go across the world and not speak the language, and you can have an instant connection with someone else. And it can just do so much for you. And classical music in particular, it’s not just for people within a certain zip code or a certain bank account or a certain socioeconomic status, it is for everyone. And I really want from this novel for people to understand that it’s all a matter of perspective. Just because you look different or just because you come from a different place, doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily a different person. It’s just where you live or how you dress. That’s all it is. It’s just physical stuff. We are all pretty much the same, and music is a great way to bring everybody together.  pamela paul  Are there any similarities between practicing music and writing or editing a novel?  brendan slocumb  I think so, 100 percent. I don’t think, had I been so disciplined in my music studies, that I would have been able to sit down and write as much as I did. In college, I would practice 3 and 1/2 hours every day, rain or shine, felt good or not, whether there was my favorite show was on, or if there was something I needed to do. It was always worked in around my practicing, every single day. And with the writing, I literally— 2020 helped, because we’re stuck inside all day. But I wrote every day. I would try to do at least 2,500 to 3,000 words daily. And I did it every day, and I had a great agent who, he would edit some things for me on the fly and throw some ideas back at me. And we would have arguments, and I would usually win. And I would insert those into the book. And it helped. It definitely helped.  pamela paul  You had a choice, given the inspiration behind the novel, to write a memoir, for example, instead of a novel, or to write a coming-of-age novel, but you chose to do a thriller. Are you a fan of the genre?  brendan slocumb  I love thrillers and mystery. I love them. I love them. One of my favorite books is “Death on the Nile” by Agatha Christie. And that was one of the first books that I read cover to cover. And I was angry, because I could not figure out— I couldn’t figure out who did it. I love that genre and it started off as, oh, this is kind of a nice sweet autobiographical thing. But yeah, it needs to— let’s bump it up a couple of notches. I wanted to write it like I was watching a movie.  pamela paul  You’ve also said again, that you really want people to understand the power of music. In addition to inspiring people to pick up the novel and read it if they haven’t, why don’t you leave us actually with some music of your own?  brendan slocumb  I would be happy to. I’m going to play just a small excerpt from the Seitz concerto, like the 3rd Movement. [MUSIC PLAYING]  pamela paul  We’ll end there. Brendan Slocumb’s new novel is called “The Violin Conspiracy.” Thank you, Brendan.  brendan slocumb  My absolute pleasure. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]  pamela paul  My colleagues MJ Franklin and Lauren Christensen join us now to talk about what we’re reading. Hey, guys.  mj franklin  Hi.  lauren christensen  Hi, Pamela.  pamela paul  Lauren, let’s start with you. What are you reading these days?  lauren christensen  Sure. So I just finished listening to the audio book of André Leon Talley’s memoir, “The Chiffon Trenches.” I had read the hard copy when it came out. And then, went back to listen to it again after he died. And it just— it was even more magical the second time around. I mean, he was a brilliant fashion editor, but he was also this really— just a really obsessive historian and a gifted writer of narrative— fashion and otherwise. So those gifts were really self-evident in the book, but I just recommend the audio over and above the hard copy, just because his voice— if you’ve heard his voice in any context, his voice really, really makes the narrative. So the story is that he was raised by his grandmother, who was a maid at Duke University in Durham in the 1950s, in North Carolina. And I think, what will stay with me forever, just from his childhood, are these images that he draws of Sunday services at this Baptist church that his family and community went to. And the women in this Black community really treated church services on Sundays like front row of Paris Fashion Week, and just his memories of their finest shift dresses and hats and gloves and handbags and mid-size heels. His real passion for that is this beautiful blending of religious community and his love of dress and art and style. So this is just a beautiful beginning. And there’s something later in his career, there’s something really fearless and frankly heroic about how he recounts this world that he joined. That was— was/is— maybe unwelcoming to everyone. I don’t know, it just seems like high fashion is just kind of built on this exclusivity. But especially unwelcoming to a gay Black man from the South. And so, he’s really heroic about recounting the racism he encountered during his fashion career. I mean, we think of him as the sort of pinnacle of that world. But there were all these rumors that were spread about him sleeping with Diana Vreeland, who was his mentor, who really began his career, or sleeping with Karl Lagerfeld. And these assumptions, that it was something other than his sheer talent that built that career. And there were whispers that people— I mean, maybe louder than whispers— that people were calling him an ape behind his back. And he really goes into the history of that insult and the kind of institutionalized nature of that insult and what that meant to him. And throughout, there’s this really aching loneliness to the book, which also really comes through in his voice. And he speaks with candor and vulnerability of sexual abuse as a young boy and his hesitation toward intimacy in adulthood, grief, shame over his sexuality and his physical size. He had a pretty serious binge-eating disorder that kind of plagued his later life. But throughout all that loneliness, you know he has this constant thread of a humor— it’s a self-aggrandizing humor, but it is so infectious. And he has this really unmistakable conviction in himself and his own talent, his self-worth. I could go on and on. I’m sorry. I’m rambling, but it’s a very— [INTERPOSING VOICES] I was going to say—  pamela paul  That sense of confidence, I think, was totally justified. The man was a genius.  lauren christensen  In so many ways, in this kind of polymath— in so many ways. And it’s just inspiring for all of us, whether you’re interested in fashion or not. I think some people think it’s just kind of a fashion memoir, but there’s really a lot there. So I recommend that. And MJ, what are you reading?  mj franklin  Before I get to— what I was going to say, I just wanted to mention, like you said that he narrates the audiobook and so?  lauren christensen  Yeah.  mj franklin  He had such an impact on the industry. And his voice meant so much. And so, I can only imagine how incredible it is to literally hear the sound of his voice, which is so dignified, which has such character throughout this already very personal memoir. That recommendation sounds incredible.  pamela paul  Longtime listeners of the podcast may remember that he was a guest on the podcast two years ago. So I highly recommend listening to that as well.  mj franklin  I read Toni Morrison’s newly published story, “Recitatif.” And it has a really, really interesting publishing history. It’s Toni Morrison’s only short story, and it was originally published in, I think, 1983 in an anthology. And now, just a few weeks ago, it was republished as a standalone book by Knopf. And it’s pretty short. The story itself is only about 40 pages. And it has a foreword by Zadie Smith that’s also about 40 pages. So it’s a pretty brief read, but I think it’s always a gift to read Toni Morrison. And so, I picked this up. And before I dive into what I thought about or what I’m thinking about still, I just want to talk about that— it’s going to set the scene, as they say. The backdrop of this story is the civil rights movement. It takes place in the ‘60s. And it’s about two girls— one Black and one white, who meet at an orphanage at a young age, and then it follows them throughout their lives, as they bump into each other repeatedly. The twist, though, is that although the two girls are of different race— one white and one Black— you don’t know which one’s white and which one’s Black. And throughout the story, Toni Morrison kind of scrubs anything that could be used as a racial marker. What I loved about this book is that from the start, the wheels as a reader just start turning, right? Like even knowing that the race of these characters are obscured, you start immediately looking for this detail in the story. Is that a clue? Is that to give away that this character is white or this character is Black? What about this thing about their mom that they mention? Is that a clue? Then you kind of pivot, and you start to wonder, What even is a racial marker? How does it appear? What do we identify as racial markers? And then you start to think, Is it even possible to determine in the story, what race each character is? And then you start to think, Does it matter? But then you push back, and you think, Well of course, it matters. Because it matters to the girls. They say something in the story like, My mom would be upset that I’m rooming with this person in an orphanage. And then it matters to the story. There’s a reason why Toni Morrison set this in the backdrop of the civil rights movement. There’s a reason why she scrubbed these racial markers. And so, in such a short amount of space, again only 40 pages, and the book is pretty like, physically small, and the print is pretty big. And so, in a short amount of space, Toni Morrison invokes in the reader this type of very, very rich searching, that I think is just the sign of a master. She’s such an impactful and smart writer. And what I was especially interested in is how this book differs from some of her novels. When I think about her novels, I think a lot about the images that she creates, these very sharp unforgettable scenes. From “Sula,” for instance, I think about Sula on her porch, watching her mom in the yard on fire as her grandmother on the ground tries to crawl and save her, right? That’s an unforgettable portrait. And from that same book, too, Sula at her friend’s wedding, giving her friend a hug, then leaving the festivities and standing by herself in the rain to leave, right? The scene of Sula by herself in the cold and the rain and the warmth of this jovial setting, like those are such rich scenes. Because Toni Morrison, I think, as a writer, just captured community, captured people, captured Blackness. And in this book, she kind of takes that all away. And there are certainly rich details in it, certainly signs of— this is a Toni Morrison story. I’m thinking about, for instance, one of the mothers in this book has these very vibrant green pants that her daughter is super embarrassed by, for instance. And so, you just see Toni Morrison in her craft, but now in a new way. She’s not necessarily capturing a scene, but she’s using the tools in her kit to get at these big ideas of what does race mean to us, and how do we see race? It’s a challenge to the reader, but such a rewarding one. One of the things I love about Toni Morrison is the depth of the writing that comes out around a newly published Toni Morrison. And so, in this case, Zadie Smith wrote this incredible introduction, where she talks about the impact of Toni Morrison, what she’s doing in this short story, and how the kind of ladder is up to how we think about race today. Likewise, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers wrote an incredible review for The Times Book Review, where she talks about the impact of Toni Morrison, about how Toni Morrison was one of the first writers that wrote about Blackness, yes. But then, also wrote about whiteness, that whiteness had markers too. That it’s not just a neutral kind of blank zone, that there is something there that we can also explore and also see. And so, just overall, it’s a short story. But it’s an incredible one. What about you, Pamela? What have you been reading?  pamela paul  I read a book that I wasn’t planning to read. The book is called “How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question,” by Michael Schur. And I never heard of Michael Schur. He is a TV writer and the creator of the show “The Good Place,” which is a show I’d never seen. But I knew Alexandra Alter was working on a story about him. And I just thought, Oh, she’s doing something about some TV guy I’ve never heard of. But I read her story and it piqued my interest. “The Good Place,” for those who haven’t seen it, is a comedy that ran about a sort of bad person, quote-unquote, who is sent to the Good Place by accident, which is a version of heaven. And it shows us how she tries to fit in to this place that’s largely occupied by good people. And I put little quote marks around the words good and bad for that whole description. Anyway, Alexandra’s story piqued my interest. I picked it up, and really read right through it. It’s a subject, actually, that’s interesting to me. He looks at several schools of thought around moral philosophy. And there was some overlap to things I’d studied in philosophy classes in college and things I argued with an ex-boyfriend who was a Ph.D. in philosophy. And there was also some overlap from a class I took in the philosophical underpinnings of the Society of Ethical Culture, which is a movement that I feel aligned with. And in that class, we read a lot of Kant. And not surprisingly, Kant is a part of this book. But actually, it’s written by a TV guy. It’s written with a lot of humor. It’s really accessible. I actually think it’s a great book for teenagers. And as soon as I finished it, I gave it to my 12-year-old, who also blazed right through it. And now of course, as a consequence, we’re watching “The Good Place,” which I guess is how book people maybe generally operate, is that they go in the opposite direction, from the book to the TV show. Whereas, maybe most people, I don’t know, go from TV to book. But in any case, it’s clear from the TV show where this book came from. Because Michael Schur started to research and talk to many philosophers in order to have the knowledge that he needed to write that TV show in a persuasive way. And the chapters are organized in a really fun way. I’ll just give you a couple of chapter titles, which will I think make clear why this is a really good book for kids. So one chapter is called, “Should I Lie and Tell My Friend I Like Her Ugly Shirt?” Another chapter is called, “Do I Have to Return My Shopping Cart to the Shopping Cart Rack Thingy? I Mean, It’s All the Way Over There.” Then there’s another chapter called, “Should I Punch My Friend in the Face for No Reason?” So it really is very accessible. And it wasn’t a surprise to me that it debuted on our best-seller list— I think at No. 1 on the combined list. So clearly, it’s striking a chord with other people; other imperfect people out there.  mj franklin  Helping people kind of tackle those big conundrums. Should I put the shopping cart back?  pamela paul  I actually, I really— that drew me in, I have to say. That was the one for me. Maybe, MJ, you always put your shopping cart back?  mj franklin  I am an anxious rule follower, so I do. But I have not thought about the morality of that decision. More just like, am I going to get in trouble? [LAUGHTER] —the anxiety of that decision.  pamela paul  Well, you know what? Michael Schur writes that he also is an anxious rule follower. He’s what, I think, Gretchen Rubin, in one of her books about these sort of four tendencies, calls an upholder, someone who’s always trying to do what’s right. And I think again, the corollary as you said to that is, because you’re afraid that you’re doing it wrong, or you’re going to get caught doing it wrong, or that someone is going to know that you’re doing it wrong. And maybe, it’s not surprising, I am one of those too? I don’t know about you, Lauren? Are you?  lauren christensen  Yeah! Like is it ethical that I’m always like trudging through the rain to find the place where the shopping cart goes or is it just paranoia that someone’s watching me? [LAUGHTER] So I too am an anxious rule follower.  pamela paul  This is a book then for both of you, too. [LAUGHTER] All right, let’s run down the titles again, starting with you, Lauren.  lauren christensen  I’m listening to “The Chiffon Trenches: A Memoir,” by André Leon Talley.  mj franklin  And I am reading “Recitatif,” the newly published story by Toni Morrison.  pamela paul

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as a humanitarian crisis there grows. But a swift victory has eluded him.  Join us for The Morning at Night, a virtual event where The New York Times newsletter anchored by David Leonhardt is brought to life.  Sabrina Tavernise, a correspondent for The New York Times, has been covering the war in Ukraine for the Times podcast “The Daily.” She will speak with David and describe what she has seen on the ground.  And it’s a word that has expressed what many have been longing for since around March 2020: normalcy.

But it’s impossible for them, given the amount of uncertainty that’s out there, to come up with good answers.”  “But that doesn’t mean the market is inefficient,” he added. “Markets can be rational without politics being rational or people always being rational. The problem with pricing is a question of how much is knowable right now. How’s this Russia thing going to work out? Who knows?”  I said I certainly didn’t.  “Has anybody got a better answer than that? I don’t think so,” he said.  You call that investment research?  I asked whether he’s been reading the analyses of Wall Street investment houses like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, or of those by independent market researchers. They don’t predict how the war in Ukraine will end. But they often recommend strategies for coping with tumultuous markets in what may be the start of a new Cold War and is certainly an era of high inflation, severed supply chains and extreme volatility.  “No, he said. “I don’t read any of that. It’s investment porn,” he said.  I was taken aback. “That’s a little harsh, isn’t it?”  “Maybe. But that stuff isn’t based on deep research. What do they really know?”  I pointed out that some of the people at investment and research firms know quite a lot. Some are economists trained by the University of Chicago and other fine institutions. He laughed. “OK,” he said. “I get it.”  In fact, along with his frequent research partner, Kenneth R. French, he is on the board of directors of Dimensional, a major investment fund company, and consults on its research, which relies heavily on his work. Much like Vanguard, the indexing giant, Dimensional eschews market timing and generally recommends long-term, diversified, buy-and-hold investing, precisely because it is so difficult to accurately forecast market returns.  I told him I’ve been receiving market analyses from Dimensional. “How does it look?” he asked. I assured him it was generally quite careful and didn’t make claims of omniscience that could not be supported.

There was no indication that the assailant knew any of the seven victims, two of whom were treated at local hospitals. The police charged the man, Steven Zajonc, with seven counts of assault and attempted assault classified as hate crimes and with seven counts of aggravated harassment and harassment that were not classified as hate crimes.  Mr. Zajonc was taken into custody outside a public library in Midtown on Wednesday afternoon, a police spokesman said. The police said the man, originally from Florida, had declined to make a statement after his arrest Wednesday night.  The first attack took place at about 6:30 p.m. on Sunday around 30th Street and Madison Avenue, when the man approached a 57-year-old woman and, without uttering a word, punched her in the face, the police said. Ten minutes later and a block west, the nightmare repeated itself. The second victim was 25.

Let’s get it down — let’s get it down to one TikTok, just save us all a bunch of time.” — JAMES CORDEN  “You know, at times this speech was like a birthday card from a 4-year-old: A lot of words didn’t make sense, but you got what it was trying to say.” — TREVOR NOAH  “But aside from policing and Covid and Ukraine, Biden also brought up a lot of policies last night that he wanted Congress to pass this year, like letting Medicare negotiate the price of drugs and doubling clean energy production and raising taxes on corporations, and strengthening voting rights — which are all great ideas that I can’t wait for him to bring up again at next year’s State of the Union. Because, I mean, if we’re honest, none of that [expletive] is going to pass through this Congress.” — TREVOR NOAH  “According to a new poll, 71 percent of Americans who watched President Biden’s State of the Union address had a positive reaction to the speech. But let’s be honest: Everyone who would have had a negative reaction was watching ‘Yellowstone.’” — SETH MEYERS

But I’ve never noticed it.” It’s only been around for a few years. But you’re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It’s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies — [water sloshing] — from the inside. But it’s not a biological virus. It’s more like a political one. And chances are, you’ve already been infected. [music] If you don’t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that’s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you’re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let’s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called “The Patriot.” It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It’s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper — no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what’s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report’s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] “A Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.” That’s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don’t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we’re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it’s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB’s most secretive departments. “Only about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.” So “active measures,” it’s a euphemism for, well, bullshit — but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. “To change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” “Within the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.” We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. “At least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.” You heard that right — 15,000 people. That’s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. “Well, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.” These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He’s 87 years old. “It’s a collage — “ He likes to paint. “ — with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.” And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. “Hello!” “Hello, hello. I am still busy.” But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry’s done it all. His first ever con — “It was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.” That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. “Now original Nazi documents.” That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry’s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called — “Disinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.” [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let’s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you’ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that’s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it’s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that’s become such a loaded term — no thanks to this guy — that it’s basically useless. Anyway, we’ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let’s get back to it. Disinformation — it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review — yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too — every agent was evaluated on — “How many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.” “You’ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn’t you?” “Unfortunately, I have to admit, yes.” Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs — but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let’s go back to 1983. And we’re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? “‘AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon’s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.’ There’s the crux of the crap.” It’s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the ’80s. [ding] “This is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.” Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we’d say flu virus, not the virus flu. “So it’s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.” “They said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot — which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.” This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they’d always try and place the story — “ — in a third-world country — ” — somewhere like — “ — say, in India, Thailand — ” — where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. “So that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.” [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in ’85, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It’s brilliant, really. They’ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we’re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke — this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It’s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. “This scientific gobbledygook — and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.” The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It’s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. “A Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.” This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. “Good afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That’s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.” [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created — and for America, the impact was toxic. “Foreign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It’s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.” Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you’re watching it. “The primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.” Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. “Everybody was working part time on the issue.” “It was not funded lavishly.” “We all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.” Yup, that’s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. “I see that it wasn’t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.” They didn’t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. “So they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.” But repeated exposure didn’t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen’s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. “And you’re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there’s nothing wrong with that.” And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. “When we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports — that’s cool. That is really cool. He couldn’t deny what we put in the report. And he didn’t deny it.” “Yet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.” “And then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.” “Our government’s view was, problem solved.” As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. “The formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.” Don’t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things. [music]

On the subject of refugees, Nicola Sturgeon told the Holyrood chamber that there was a “moral, humanitarian obligation” to help those fleeing the war, adding that she wanted to “appeal directly to the prime minister to follow the example of the European Union and allow anyone fleeing the horror of Ukraine entry to the UK if they wish and deal with the paperwork later”.  Sturgeon also pledged action on oligarchs in Scotland, after the Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer challenged her about Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin who has received hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of agricultural subsidies for his 1,210 hectare (3,000 acre) estate in Scotland.  Sturgeon said there would be an immediate review of such schemes, adding:  I have sought urgent advice on the maximum possible action the Scottish government can take against individuals or entities identifying as having close links with the Russian regime … including ending support from the public purse and freezing assets.  She said her government was also writing to Scottish businesses encouraging them to review and sever links with Russia.

As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said.  Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term.  “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”.  Ukrainian negotiators arrived by helicopter in Belarus for talks with Russia’s delegation on Thursday seeking an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave frontline areas, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said. Kyiv has previously warned Russia’s demands were not realistic.  The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video that his country’s defensive lines were holding against the Russian invasion and praised the nation’s resistance in the face of relentless missile strikes.  “We are a people who in a week have destroyed the enemy’s plans,” Zelenskiy said. “They will have no peace here.” Russian troops forced to visit supermarkets for food were not “warriors of a superpower, but confused children who have been used”, he said.  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would not let Ukraine keep infrastructure that threatened Russia or tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine, adding, without evidence, that Russia had information the US was worried about losing control over what he called chemical and biological laboratories in Ukraine, and accusing Nato of trying to maintain supremacy.  Heavy overnight and early-morning shelling was again reported in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people where emergency services said 34 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. A university and a hospital were hit, and TV footage showed a city-centre wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.  People fleeing from Ukraine arrive at the train station in Przemyśl, Poland on Wednesday. Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock  Russian forces on Thursday occupied the regional administration building in Kherson, the regional governor, Hennadiy Lahuta said, after the city’s mayor said Russian soldiers were in de facto control of the local council building.  “I didn’t make any promises to them … I just asked them not to shoot people,” said Ihor Kolykhaiev. The capture of Kherson, strategically located at the mouth of the Dnipro River and with a population of nearly 250,000, would mark the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion on 24 February.  The city would maintain a strict 8pm to 6am curfew, restrict traffic to food and medicine deliveries, and require residents to obey commands and not to provoke the troops, he said. “The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,” he wrote. “And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.”  With fighting continuing on multiple fronts across Ukraine, Mariupol, another large port city on the Azov Sea, was reportedly encircled and without light, water or heat. The city council said the shelling had been relentless and Russian troops were creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by trying to prevent civilians leaving.  01:06 'What the hell was that?': large explosions reported over Kyiv – video  “They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade,” the council said. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying critical life-support infrastructure. This is genocide of Ukrainian people.”  Residents of Odesa on the Black Sea, Ukraine’s biggest port city and a vital link in Ukraine’s economy, were also preparing to defend it amid warnings of an imminent Russian seaborne landing. Airstrikes on the city have multiplied and a Russian naval convoy of at least eight ships was seen off the coast.  Russia’s advance on the capital has made little progress, the UK’s defence ministry said. “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km (19 miles) from the centre, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,” it said.  Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the situation in the capital was “difficult but under control”, adding that there had been no casualties overnight and that explosions heard overnight were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles.  The UN human rights office has confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the fighting, but said the actual toll would already be much higher. Ukraine has said at least 350 civilians have died and more than 2,000 have been injured.  The UN refugee agency said the number of people fleeing the country had surpassed 1 million by early Thursday morning – about 2% of Ukraine’s population of 44 million – adding that “at this rate” the exodus could make the country the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century”.  The high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, appealed for the “guns to fall silent” so humanitarian aid could reach millions more still inside the country, and cautioned that the flood of people escaping the war was far from over and could eventually total 4 million.  The Russian attack, condemned on Wednesday in an overwhelming vote at the UN general assembly, has led to a barrage of international sanctions that have plunged Russia’s economy into chaos and ever deepening isolation.  The rouble again hit record lows on Thursday after the ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to “junk” status, while an estimated 80% of Russian banks’ assets – and half its central bank’s reserves – have been immobilised.  The EU was readying additional steps against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorated, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday, and was also preparing in case of Russian retaliation.  French authorities on Thursday seized the Amore Vero, a superyacht owned by a company linked to Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian energy giant Rosneft, at La Ciotat, near Marseille, after reports that German authorities had seized the superyacht Dilbar belonging to the billionaire Alisher Usmanov on Wednesday.  The international criminal court has opened an investigation into possible war crimes after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move. Karim Khan, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine.

While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping, and potentially waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.  Efforts to ascertain the status of the convoy and the threat it poses have been set back by recent cloud cover over Ukraine that has prevented Maxar Technologies – which issued the first satellite images of the convoy – from releasing new pictures.  “Heavy cloud cover has blanketed Ukraine,” said Maxar, “and [it has] prevented us from providing new satellite imagery-based updates of the current activity.”  Northern end of convoy south-east of Ivankiv, Ukraine, on 28 February. Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters  While information about Russian troop movements in other parts of Ukraine where there has been fighting has been well documented on social media, the convoy outside Kyiv has existed in what amounts to an information black hole, suggesting that Russia forces may closely control the territory around it.  The convoy, which at one stage was reportedly about 40 miles (65km) in length, with vehicles pictured three abreast on the P02 road to the immediate north of Kyiv, includes armoured vehicles, tanks, trucks, fuel tankers and artillery pieces. Its presence suggested Russian forces were massing for an attack on Kyiv.  Western defence assessments in the UK and US, however, put a more optimistic slant on the convoy’s apparent lack of progress, although it was not clear what evidence that was based on.  The UK’s Ministry of Defence tweeted: “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days.”  The Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, in a press briefing on Wednesday, gave a more nuanced assessment, saying there had been limited movement from the military force and that it “remain[ed] stalled”. However, he cautioned that lack of movement could be due to Russia’s forces regrouping.  Saying that the convoy had “not made any appreciable progress, geographically speaking, in the last 24-36 hours”, Kirby added: “In general we believe there are a couple of reasons for that. One reason is we believe the Russians are deliberately regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time.  “Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistic and sustainment challenges. Challenges that we don’t believe they fully anticipated. Three, they are getting resistance from the Ukrainians. We have some indications, nothing that we can 100% verify, that the Ukrainians have indeed tried to slow down that convoy.”

The government has come under intense pressure in recent days over the pace at which it is taking action against individuals with links to the Kremlin, despite the prime minister’s promise last week to “squeeze Russia from the global economy, piece by piece”.  There is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individuals has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion.  “It’s a big cross-Whitehall process between the Home Office and the Foreign Office – which should have started months ago – and it’s exposing the system’s weaknesses,” one Whitehall source said. “The government is weeks behind where it should be.”  Whitehall insiders claim that the Sanctions Act of 2018, passed after Brexit, makes the procedure legally cumbersome, with overstretched government lawyers now facing a vast caseload.  They said the Foreign Office was likely to announce the names of more sanctioned individuals “very soon” and would then continue to work painstakingly through a much longer list of figures.  The levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, is understood to be considering plans to toughen up the government’s powers, so that sanctioned oligarchs’ properties could be seized without compensation – rather than just frozen.  One suggestion is that such properties could then be used to house Ukrainian refugees.  Johnson’s official spokesperson rejected the idea that the government was acting too slowly, suggesting that measures targeting banks and other Russian companies would be more effective in cutting off funding for the Putin regime. “We are prioritising what we think will have the biggest impact first,” he said.  However, he also effectively conceded that legal constraints were preventing ministers from moving faster, saying “we are just making sure we have done the requisite work that meets the legal bar”. He said there was a “constant review of whether we can do more to go even faster”.  One government aide said that requisitioning individuals’ property “jars” with the UK’s tradition of upholding the rule of law, and offering security to investors – though they denied there was any dissent within government about pressing ahead. “We’re going full tonto on this, within the parameters of the rule of law,” the aide said.  Institutional caution among government lawyers has been blamed by some Tories, but a government source said the UK’s sanctions regime, newly separate to the EU, was relatively untested, apart from the narrow Magnitsky sanctions’ focus.  The source emphatically denied there was a lack of political will and said senior cabinet ministers had been repeatedly raising the issue and asking questions about why the UK appeared behind.  Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president, accused the UK of lagging behind on Thursday. “I don’t hesitate to say this,” he told the BBC. “The UK is now following our lead. And I’m sure they will continue to follow the lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this.”  Separately, the Guardian understands the government is preparing to toughen up the long-delayed economic crime bill, after pressure from Labour – including by cutting the 18-month implementation period for a new register revealing the ultimate owners of UK properties.  The legislation is aimed at preventing kleptocrats from parking what Johnson has called their “ill-gotten gains” in UK property. Guardian analysis suggests oligarchs who have already been sanctioned by the EU or the US are linked to almost £200m of property in London and the home counties.  Labour had warned that the 18 months’ grace contained in the draft bill would give oligarchs time to “quietly launder their money”, and tabled an amendment that would remove it.  It is understood that Downing Street and the business department do not intend to accept the amendment – but are instead working on their own changes to the bill, with government sources insisting they would have done this irrespective of Labour pressure. It has not yet been decided how much the grace period will be reduced.  The bill is also now expected to include a promise to act rapidly in tightening up the anti-fraud procedures used by Companies House, the body that maintains the register of UK firms.  The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called on the government to bring forward legislation next week to speed up the process.  “It is totally unacceptable that a week after Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine just 11 oligarchs have faced sanctions by the UK government. Ministers had months to prepare for this eventuality, with the full support of parliament, and there is no excuse for their failure to introduce strong enough laws in the first place,” he said.  “The government’s failure to keep pace with the EU and the US on sanctions is allowing Putin-linked oligarchs to salvage hundreds of millions in assets.”

Governments in Europe should also impose a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza from soaring energy prices, and use it to cut energy bills for hard-pressed consumers, according to a 10-point plan formulated by the International Energy Agency that would reduce Russian gas imports by about a third before next winter.  The planned closure of several nuclear power stations should also be delayed, red tape should be cut to bring forward the construction of more wind and solar generation and efforts to improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses must be stepped up urgently, the IEA said.  Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, the global energy watchdog, said: “Russia is using its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon. This is clear to everyone in the world.”  Adjusting home thermostats by 1C would save about 10bn cubic metres of gas within a year, a useful saving on total Russian gas imports of 155bn cubic metres, if implemented alongside the other measures. Birol said: “It would help to reduce [household] energy bills, but maintain comfort.”  The 10-point plan also includes advice to governments not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia’s state-owned energy company Gazprom, or to renew expiring deals; to set a minimum obligation on energy companies to store gas; to speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps; and to seek alternative gas supplies from elsewhere in the world.  The EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas consumption. Gas prices have soared to record levels in recent months, in part owing to the global economic rebound from Covid-19, but also because Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, engineered a reduction of about 25% in Russian gas supplies to Europe in recent months, in preparation for his invasion.  Barbara Pompili, minister for ecological transition for France, holder of the EU’s revolving presidency, said: “More than ever, getting rid of Russian fossil fuels and of fossil fuels in general is essential. What is at stake is both the need to accelerate the fight against climate change and, as we can see now, the short-term energy security of the European continent.”  The European Commission will use the IEA’s proposals to inform its own plan of action on energy in response to the Ukraine war, to be published next week.  Kadri Simson, the EU’s energy commissioner, said the bloc had already been moving away from gas but that the Ukraine war made it more urgent. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a watershed moment,” she said.  The UK government is also understood to be urgently examining its exposure to gas market turbulence, caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK does not directly contract with Russia for pipeline gas, as Germany and some other EU countries do, as UK gas supplies come mainly from the North Sea, Norway and some tanker deliveries, but the impacts on the prices and availability of gas are felt internationally.  Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre and professor of energy policy at Imperial College London, said some of the IEA’s findings could apply to the UK. “Accelerating the deployment of renewables projects, getting on with energy efficiency, [and] maximising output from nuclear stations are all no-brainers in both the UK and EU,” he said. “However, we should not expect that we can magic the capacity to retrofit our houses into existence in no time at all.”  The UK could be more exposed than its EU neighbours to gas market turbulence. The government allowed the UK’s last large-scale gas storage facility to close in 2017, despite warnings on how it would affect resilience. After Brexit, the government also opted out of an EU pact to share gas storage in the event of supply constraints.  Gross warned: “We will be reliant on attracting gas by paying the market rates. We can secure enough gas but we have to pay the price.”  Even if all of the IEA’s advice is followed, the result will be only to reduce EU need for Russian gas by about a third, leaving Europe still heavily reliant on Putin’s control of Russian fossil fuel resources.  The IEA said its advice was consistent with the EU’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the European green deal, and would not require any increase of fossil fuel use. However, if Putin were to cut European gas supplies further, causing gas prices to rise even higher than current levels, the EU could come under pressure to expand its use of coal instead of cutting it.

The IPC had announced on Thursday that it was reversing its shock decision 24 hours earlier to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals following intense international pressure, but will now see its decision challenged in the court of arbitration for sport.  The Russian sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, confirmed an appeal to let its athletes compete – which Russia hopes will be heard immediately – saying the ban had been “a manipulation of the Olympic charter”.  “We are currently in work to establish our legal position to file lawsuits on the protection of our athletes’ rights, against the discrimination of athletes based on their ethnicity and the use of sports as a tool of a political pressure,” Matytsin said.  “Today’s decision of the International Paralympic Committee to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes’ rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives’ values in pursuit of political goals.”  One of the primary factors amid the U-turn by the IPC announced by its president, Andrew Parsons, was a revolt among competing nations and a threat of a boycott.  “In taking our decision yesterday we were looking at the long-term health and survival of the Paralympic movement,” Parsons said of the initial reasoning that the athletes could compete. “We are fiercely proud of the principles and values that have made the movement what it is today. However, what is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games.  “In the last 12 hours an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us and been very open, for which I am grateful. They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences for the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games. Multiple NPCs [national participating committees], some of which have been contacted by their governments, teams and athletes, are threatening not to compete.  03:37 Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer  “With this in mind, and in order to preserve the integrity of these Games and the safety of all participants, we have decided to refuse the athlete entries from RPC and NPC Belarus.”  The ban will affect around 83 athletes from the two countries. Parsons described the situation in the athletes’ village in Beijing as being “untenable” without the ban being implemented due to dissent among athletes as well as NPCs.  The British Paralympic Authority was one of the organisations to have criticised the decision and the UK government had also asked that the IPC reconsider. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, welcomed the reversal. “I am pleased that the IPC has now come to the right decision,” she said. “The welfare of all the other competing athletes is of utmost importance and we are pleased the IPC also recognise that. The whole country will be fully behind our ParalympicsGB team at the Games.”  Dorries is to chair an international meeting of sports ministers on Thursday to discuss how to further strengthen action against the Russian state. Among the items on the agenda are a complete boycott of Russian athletes in sporting events and an end to sporting investment in Russia. A spokesperson said: “The government wants to ensure the Russian state cannot use sport to legitimise its regime in any way and is asking domestic sporting bodies and international partners to leave no stone unturned in looking at how far they can go in punishing Putin’s regime.”  Parsons, meanwhile, also apologised to athletes from Russia and Belarus for the action the IPC felt forced to take: “To the Para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions your governments took last week in breaching the Olympic truce. You are victims of your governments’ actions.  “I hope and pray that we can get back to a situation when the talk and focus is fully on the power of sport to transform the lives of persons with disabilities, and the best of humanity.”

But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war.  Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland.  Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape.  In the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, hundreds of one room schoolhouses were once named after Ukrainian figures and communities. Nearly 30 towns and a handful of parks are named after places and people from Ukraine  Vegreville, Alberta, where Toroshenko now lives, boasts one of the world’s largest pysankas – an intricately painted Ukrainian Easter egg weighing more than 5,500 pounds and drawing thousands of curious tourists each year.  In recent weeks, a sombre mood has taken hold in the farming community .  “Each morning on television I watch Kyiv getting bombed all over the place. I see images of Ukrainians taking up arms. Regular people, as young as 18, defending their country,” Toroshenko said. “It’s horrific.”  As Ukrainian-Canadians pore over news accounts and social media the Russian invasion has also unearthed painful memories of their own family histories – many of which are marked by conflict, dispossession and exile.  “My father chose to come here for a better life,” she said. “He wanted a place where he could be free and where if he worked hard, he and others could make something of themselves.”  That history inspired Toroshenko to return the favor to her family’s homeland, traveling ten times to Ukraine as an elections observer. But as the war continues, she fears the democratic structures she and thousands of others helped establish over the years are under threat of collapse – as is the dream of what Ukraine could become.  Canada’s deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who grew up in a tight-knit rural Ukrainian community in the Prairies, spoke last week to the country’s diaspora, offering words of hope.  “When she spoke, she used the first line of the national anthem. She said ‘Ukraine has not yet perished,” said Toroshenko. “It was amazing to hear. It really resonated with us. It moved us.”  Others have tried to shake off the sense of powerlessness, drawing instead on the tightness of the community.  Zoya Kostetsky moved from Lviv to Canada in 2005 and has raised money for Ukrainian relief through raffle draws. Photograph: Handout  “Immigrating to Canada was hard for us, as it is for most people. But to be able to see ourselves in the Ukrainians who came before us was an inspiration. It showed us there was a place for us here – and a path for us to follow,” said Zoya Kostetsky, a Winnipeg-based artisan who moved from to Canada from the Ukrainian city of Lviv in 2005.  She attended one of the ten English-Ukrainian bilingual schools in the province and found a strong cultural network to help her settle in Canada: “We found a sense of community. They spoke the language, they followed the same traditions and celebrated the same holidays.”  As she stood with her family at a recent rally against the war, she was struck by how the grief she felt was shared across the crowd.  “Everyone was suffering. Everyone had someone they were worried about. And in a grim way, it made it easier.”  Desperate to help in some way, she organized a raffle with prizes from local businesses, and raised more than C$20,000 to aid in relief efforts.  But the knowledge that if her family hadn’t left, they too would be facing the prospect of fighting in the war has left a heavy mark on her.  “My dad is still young enough to be in the military, so he would be in the war. I would be in the war. My mom is a medic, so she would be doing medical work in the war. My brother would be in the war,” she said. “Our whole family would be fighting on the frontlines.”  The funds she has raised have gone to help both citizens fighting and those fleeing to neighboring countries, and Kostetsky said the gratitude from aid groups in Ukraine – and the overwhelming support of the broader community around her, have kept her motivated.  “I’ll keep doing what I can every day until this is over,” she said. “Because until then I won’t be able to relax at all. I can’t just sit back and watch as this country gets destroyed.”

Russia launched its attack on Ukraine on 24 February, four days after the end of the Games. On 21 February, Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of separatist-held territories of eastern Ukraine and ordered in troops.  Wang again blamed Nato’s eastward expansion and the US administration’s attitude towards Ukraine’s Nato membership for the deterioration of relations with Russia. He said the cause of the current crisis was “a fact known by heart to all”. “Only those who start the problem can end it,” he added.  According to the New York Times, which quoted Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report, senior Chinese officials told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.  The report said the intelligence on the exchange between the Chinese and Russian officials was classified, and it was unclear whether the exchange took place in a face-to-face conversation between Xi Jinping and Putin in early February, or through other channels.  It said different intelligence services had varying interpretations, and it was not clear how widely the information was shared.  The impact of Russia’s invasion appears to have caught China’s diplomats off guard. Citing a separate source, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said it was “apparent from Beijing’s lack of warning to its approximately 6,000 citizens stranded in Ukraine in recent days – amid news that a Chinese national was wounded by gunfire – that it did not expect a major war.”  In the past week, as the war raged on, China signalled it was willing to play the role of a mediator. Beijing said it “laments” the outbreak of the conflict. It asked the Ukrainian side to provide assistance to Chinese nationals who were finding it difficult to leave.  While western sanctions have imposed sanctions on Russia, China said on Wednesday that it would not follow suit. “We will not participate in such sanctions. We will continue to maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with relevant parties,” said Guo Shuqing, the chair of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.  The New York Times said the intelligence report indicated senior Chinese officials had some level of knowledge about Russia’s plans or intentions to invade Ukraine before Moscow launched the operation last week, which has so far killed thousands of civilians and forced at least a million Ukrainians to flee home, according to the UN.  Separately, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that China had made the request but declined to provide details. The source declined to be identified owing to the sensitivity of the matter, the Reuters report said.  A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said on Wednesday that the claims were “speculations without any basis and are intended to blame-shift and smear China”.  The US state department, the CIA and the White House national security council have not commented on the allegations.  On Wednesday the United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly voted to reprimand Russia for invading Ukraine and demanded that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces. China and India abstained in the vote.

French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said it had seized a yacht linked to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat.  The finance ministry said the yacht was owned by an entity of which Sechin had been identified as the main shareholder.  The announcement came as authorities in Hamburg denied reports that Usmanov’s yacht had been seized in a shipyard in the German port city.  “No yachts have been confiscated,” a spokesperson for Hamburg’s economic authority said. “A handover [of the yacht to its owner] is also currently not planned. No yacht is going to leave the port that is not allowed to do so.”  The Hamburg local authority said any order to seize properties subject to sanctions would have to come from higher federal customs authorities.  A Forbes report citing three sources in the yacht industry had reported on Usmanov’s 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday.  Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine.  Usmanov’s 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday, according to a Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry.

Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images  The Guardian understands that repair works on the Dilbar yet have currently been put on hold, and that the ship is not in a seaworthy state.  The yacht has been in the yards of shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October. A spokesperson declined to give a statement but said that all projects by shipbuilder Lürssen would be treated “in accordance with the law”.  Forbes reported that representatives for Usmanov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ukraine’s adviser to the minister of internal affairs, Anton Geraschenko, responded to the report on Telegram by saying the yacht should be sent to Ukraine and refitted as a missile cruiser.  Usmanov bought Dilbar in 2016 for a reported cost of $600m from German shipbuilder Lürssen, which custom-built it for him over 52 months.  The firm describes it as “one of the most complex and challenging yachts ever built, in terms of both dimensions and technology”.  At the time of its launch, Lürssen CEO, Peter Lürssen, said: “Dilbar has the most advanced security technologies of any superyacht in the world. But the things you read about it containing an anti-aircraft missile defence system are all nonsense.”  At 15,917 tonnes, it’s the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, and is typically staffed by a crew of 96 people, with space for 24 passengers in 12 suites. It has the largest pool ever installed on a yacht as well as two helicopter pads, a sauna, a beauty salon and a gym.  At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires are now anchored or cruising in Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation that does not have an extradition treaty with the US, ship tracking data showed.  The vessels’ arrival in the archipelago off the coast of Sri Lanka follows the imposition of severe western sanctions on Russia.  Usmanov at a conference in Moscow in 2016. Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/EPA  The Clio superyacht, owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal, who was sanctioned by the US in 2018, was anchored off the capital Male on Wednesday, according to shipping database MarineTraffic.  The Titan, owned by Alexander Abramov, a cofounder of steel producer Evraz, arrived on 28 February.  Three more yachts owned by Russian billionaires were seen cruising in Maldives waters on Wednesday, the data showed. They include the 88-metre (288 ft) Nirvana owned by Russia’s richest man, Vladimir Potanin. Most vessels were last seen anchored in Middle Eastern ports earlier in the year.  A spokesperson for Maldives’ government did not respond to a request for comment.  The $600m Dilbar is regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world. Photograph: Geoff Moore/Rex/Shutterstock  The US has said it will take strict action to seize property of sanctioned Russians.  “This coming week, we will launch a multilateral transatlantic taskforce to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs: their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law,” the White House said in a tweet on Sunday.  Washington imposed sanctions on Deripaska and other influential Russians in 2018 because of their ties to president Vladimir Putin after alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election, which Moscow denies.

Eliezer Sherbatov was with his team, HC Mariupol of the Ukrainian Hockey League, in the Donetsk region last week preparing for a game against Kramatorsk when a bomb exploded outside their hotel.  “At 5am, I’m sleeping and hear: ‘Boom!’ You never hear that strong of a sound,” Sherbatov told TSN. “And it starts shaking, everything is shaking. So, a couple of metres away, the war started.”  Sherbatov said the team’s coach called a meeting at breakfast, where he explained: “Guys - the war has started. It’s unfortunate, but I would suggest you to stay put as a team. But if you choose to leave, it’s your decision.’”  Sherbatov said he and the team’s other European-Canadian eventually decided to go the local train station in Druzhkiva. The train to Lviv, however, was two days late.  “We received a call that the trains are getting shot as of now. So, the third guy that was supposed to come with us, he tells me, ‘I’m not going because I don’t want to die.’ It’s a 50-50 … chance. That’s what they said. That’s a 50-50 chance, [if] you go on the train, you [may] die. Tell me, what would you do? What decision would you take? You stay, you go to a bomb shelter, and you hope that a person doesn’t put a grenade inside the bomb shelter … Or you take the train and have a 50-50 chance at survival.”  After speaking to his father and putting his trust in God, Sherbatov said, he decided to board the train. It travelled north-west through Kramatorsk and Kharkiv then west through Kyiv, all of which are under heavy assault by the Russian military.  “Imagine how I felt in that 24 hours. I called this train the Train Of Death because every single second, you think you’re going to get shot,” he said. “It’s army everywhere – you just don’t know which [one].”  After arriving in Lviv, Sherbatov was helped by the Latvian embassy and a team of Israeli volunteers, who he said put him in charge of a bus of children and elderly people leaving for Poland. “Nobody at the consulate was coming with us because they had to wait for others,” he said. “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life, to be responsible for 17 people when it’s a matter of life and death.”  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

On returning to Canada, Sherbatov was reunited with his family. “I met my son for the first time, and I thought I would never see them. I thought I would never see my family,” he said. “My daughter was sleeping … I hugged her and I just stayed there, just crying and stayed there. When you think you’re not going to come back, you’re never going to see your parents, the only thing you want to do now is be with your family the rest of your life.”  The Ukrainian Hockey League, where Sherbatov played for HC Mariupol, has suspended all operations because of the Russian invasion. The KHL, the largest hockey league outside of North America’s NHL, has also been affected by the war. The league is dominated by Russian clubs but two non-Russian teams, Jokerit of Finland and Dinamo Riga of Latvia, have dropped out because of the war. The league’s other non-Russian teams – Kunlun (China), Dinamo Minsk (Belarus) and Barys Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) – have yet to comment.  Meanwhile, may of the KHL’s prominent western-born players are leaving, or attempting to leave Russia. Last week Markus Granlund of Finland broke his agreement with Salavat Yulaev Ufa just as the playoffs were beginning. Some North Americans are cancelling their contracts, too, including Shane Prince – who signed with Lugano of the Swiss league on 1 March – Geoff Platt and Nick Shore. KHL players are paid in rubles, and the currency is falling; journalist Chris Johnston has reported that agents operating in Russia fear for the long-term viability of the league.  KHL goalkeeper Frans Tuohimaa of Finland – who defeated Russia in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics less than a month ago – told the Yle Urheilu newspaper that he tried to break his agreement with Neftehimik Nizhnekamsk but was refused permission. “I do not feel insecure here, but I have my values ​​and for ethical reasons I want to leave. It feels wrong to be here,” Tuohimaa said. Sixteen players and five coaches from Finland remain in the KHL.  Meanwhile Russia’s most famous hockey player, Alexander Ovechkin, has attracted headlines by calling for “No more war”, despite forming a pro-Putin social media organisation in 2017 and accusing the Ukrainian government of being fascists in 2014, when Russian annexed Crimea.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could see the “largest refugee crisis this century”, the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months.  More than 1 million people have already crossed borders since 24 February, when the Russian invasion began.  The 2015 refugee crisis saw 1.3 million people attempt to reach Europe from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.  Where are people going?  Domestic civilian flights were cancelled on the first day of the invasion. Since then, people have been heading west into neighbouring countries including Poland, Romania, Moldova and Hungary.  More than half – nearly 548,000 – have fled to Poland which shares a 500km border with Ukraine. A further 133,000 have gone to Hungary, 72,000 to Slovakia, 51,260 to Romania, and nearly 98,000 to non-EU Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. A small number, just over 350, have travelled to Belarus.  What has been the response of neighbouring countries?  In contrast to previous migration waves, neighbouring countries such as Poland and Hungary have opened their borders to everyone fleeing the Russian attacks. However, there have been reports of people of colour trying to flee Ukraine, mostly students from Africa and the Middle East, being pushed back and suffering racial discrimination when trying to cross borders.  At the Polish border, people, mostly women and children, are waiting up to 60 hours to cross. Ukrainian men are not allowed to leave as they are legally obliged to help defend the country. The UN refugee agency says conditions are bleak, temperatures are freezing and many are spending days on the road waiting to cross.  The Polish authorities have offered comprehensive help to refugees, including free train travel and access to healthcare. Poland also dropped its requirement to show a negative Covid test.  Hungary has opened sections of its border that were closed to migration. Moldova already has networks of volunteers providing support and hosting families crossing the border.  Germany and Austria are offering free train travel to those seeking to reach their countries.  Germans offer accommodation to Ukrainians arriving in Hauptbahnhof station, Berlin. Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Getty  What has been the response across Europe?  The EU has reacted with a swift and unified response. By the end of this week, EU member states are expected to have triggered a hitherto unused directive, created in 2001 after the wars in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, known as the Temporary Protection Directive.  Designed to operate when the traditional asylum system is overwhelmed, it is expected to give Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years. Ukrainians will also be able to work, access education and housing without having to claim asylum.  What has the UK response been so far?  So far the UK has struck a different tone to its European neighbours. The government has said it could take in 200,000 or more refugees, if they are relatives of British nationals or Ukrainian people already settled here. Businesses will also be allowed to sponsor a Ukrainian person to come to the UK.

Footage of an attack on a car park in Kharkiv, described by a Bellingcat researcher as a cluster bomb strike, appears to show a residential park nearby, and similar bombs exploded along a road.  Intentionally targeting civilians or civilian buildings is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law. Russia routinely denies it engages in illegal attacks. Cluster munitions, which indiscriminately scatter small bombs over a wide area, are banned by more than 100 states. But neither Russia nor Ukraine (nor the US) have signed up to a treaty first introduced in 2008 that bans them

More heavy explosions were reported in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and second city, Kharkiv, overnight and on Thursday after Russian strikes. Shelling has killed 34 civilians in Kharkiv in the past 24 hours, authorities said.  Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port Kherson, local authorities said.  Vladimir Putin has told the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that Ukrainian intransigence means “the worst is yet to come” in Ukraine , the Elysée palace said, in a 90-minute call in which the Russian leader also said Moscow was aiming for “full control” of the country by diplomatic or military means.  Ukraine’s defensive lines are holding against the Russian attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukrainian cities since midnight.  The Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and is still more than 19 miles (30km) from the centre of the city, Britain’s defence ministry said.  At least 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said.  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would not tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine. He said, without evidence, that the US was worried about losing control over what he called chemical and biological laboratories in Ukraine.  A second round of ceasefire talks is about to begin, officials from both sides have confirmed, but with little hope of an immediate breakthrough.  Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Moscow said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties.  The international criminal court confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and has begun collecting evidence.  The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, with 141 of the 193 member states voting for the resolution on Wednesday.  The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and has called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs.  Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”.  Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges.  Russian and Belarusian athletes were banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the conflict, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said, in a reversal of its previous stance.

A week into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Black Sea port of Kherson has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces.  Russian artillery and missiles continue to bombard other major cities, including the second-biggest city, Kharkiv, and the capital, Kyiv, where several large explosions were heard overnight. But the Russian advance on the capital has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and is still more than 19 miles (30km) from the centre of the city, Britain’s defence ministry said.  Mariupol city council has said Russia is constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power, and preventing supplies being brought in or people being evacuated.  Residents in the key Black Sea port of Odesa are increasing preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships.  A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia was due to get under way on Thursday. The international criminal court (ICC) has opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine after 39 countries formally referred reports of atrocities, the largest referral it has ever received. And more than 1 million people have so far fled Ukraine in the fastest refugee exodus this century, the UN said.  Russian troops in the southern city of Kherson:  A series of explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. The CBS reporter Charlie D’Agata was filmed as a bright flash and large boom could be seen and heard behind him.  01:06 'What the hell was that?': large explosions reported over Kyiv – video  The basement of a Kyiv hospital is now the maternity ward, where new mothers are bringing life into a world violently upended by the invasion.  What has happened since Russia invaded?  On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war.  Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv.  A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv.  Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea.  On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer.  On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital.  Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces.  On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv.  Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack.  On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital.  On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv (pictured below) overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Mariupol was reportedly surrounded by Russian troops.  How did we get here?  Over the past few months Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine.  Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions.  The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded.  The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.  What do we know about Russia’s deployments?  Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine.  An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion.  Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown.

Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea.  The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February.  Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations.  How do the militaries compare?  Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland.  What is the historical context?  In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war.  A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.  Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war.  What is the role of Nord Stream 2?  On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics.  First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.  Europe’s most divisive energy project, the route of Nord Stream 2 bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.

NewsGuard, a US-based organisation monitoring the trustworthiness of news and information websites, said Russian state media sources are being joined by lesser known sites in pushing deceptive narratives.  It published a top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” including an “attack” on a chemical plant in eastern Ukraine and claiming legitimacy for the 2014 referendum on Crimea joining Russia.  The warning came as Facebook and Instagram said on Monday they were blocking access to the Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik across the EU. TikTok has followed suit, while YouTube has blocked the broadcasters on its platform in the UK and Europe and Twitter indicated it would block RT and Sputnik in the EU.  NewsGuard said it had identified and is tracking 114 web domains including Russian state media sources such as RT, Sputnik and Tass but warned that websites with no direct links to the Kremlin are pushing false content on mainstream social media platforms.  “Russia employs a multilayered strategy to introduce, amplify, and spread false and distorted narratives across the world – relying on a mix of official state media sources, anonymous websites and accounts, and other methods to distribute propaganda that advances the Kremlin’s interests and undermines its adversaries,” the analysis said.  “Its government-funded and operated websites use digital platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to launch and promote false narratives.”  NewsGuard said the outlets pushing disinformation included anonymous websites, foundations and research websites with indeterminate funding.  The major social media platforms have said they are on alert for disinformation linked to the Russian invasion. The owner of Facebook and Instagram, Meta, has launched a “special operations centre” to monitor content related to the week-long conflict, while Twitter said it has suspended more than a dozen accounts that originated in Russia. YouTube and TikTok have also said they are closely monitoring content related to the conflict.  These are NewsGuard’s top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” – followed by NewsGuard’s refutation:

He runs Lavender.Five, a crypto validator service that authenticates transactions on the blockchain (imagine a deregulated branch of the Securities and Exchange Commission).  On 25 February, he issued a plea to his 1,700 Twitter followers, “We’ll match any donation made to a charity in support of Ukraine, up to a total of $1,000.” The next day, Schultz posted the fruits of his initiative; 0.028 bitcoin, equaling the total donations of about $1,100, sent to a crypto wallet operated by a Ukrainian military NGO called Come Back Alive. He’s one tiny part of a chorus of countless other crypto holders all over the world who’ve raced to back Ukrainians in the face of an invading force. Reports claim that more than $30m in cryptocurrency has been funneled to the country since the war began. So has charity finally become decentralized?  “I decided early on that Lavender.Five would use its platform to make a positive difference, no matter how small,” says Schultz. “Crypto is inherently worldwide. To donate using traditional currency often requires intermediaries. You can’t donate USD directly, you first need to convert it in some way, or find an intermediary. … Cryptocurrency solves this by simplifying the process. If you have the address for the charity, you can simply enter the address, enter the amount to donate, and hit send.”  Ukraine, like many former Soviet states, has battled corruption and a severe dearth of international funding since gaining independence in 1991. So maybe that is why the Ukrainian government took the unusual step of tweeting out crypto wallet codes for global financing through both bitcoin and Ethereum – the two most popular digital tokens – from official accounts. “Stand with the people of Ukraine Now accepting cryptocurrency donations,” wrote Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, on 26 February. Nonprofits and local businesses in the besieged country have mirrored the government’s request. The Kyiv Independent, an English language newspaper in the capital city, is accepting patronage through bitcoin.  Come Back Alive, the NGO that Schultz contributed to, was previously active on Patreon – processing traditional currency donations – before being terminated from the platform because it violated an existing moratorium on military fundraisers. Naturally, the firm found a second life thanks to a “crypto collective” called UkraineDAO which is collecting decentralized aid for a variety of Ukrainian organizations. As the state is gradually dragged into brutal urban warfare, perhaps it makes sense that the residents are petitioning for an untrackable currency – particularly as donations can be anonymous and therefore avoid any retaliation from the Russian state.  “Blockchain allows us to scale our efforts in a way that wasn’t possible for us before,” said Nadya Tolokonnikova, a spokeswoman for Ukraine DAO, in an interview with The New York Times. “The old ways of raising money sometimes are really slow and just clumsy.”  For the most ardent cryptocurrency diehards, the crisis in Ukraine is a perfect encapsulation of the reasons why they believe the global economic hegemony needs to be broken up. The Ukrainian people need help, and they argue that bitcoin’s ability to eschew bureaucratic red tape is the best way to provide immediate service to a vulnerable population. “It’s just the cheapest, fastest, and most secure way to transact financially,” says Artemis, who declined to offer his real name but says he’s from Canada and donated $280 in bitcoin to Come Back Alive. “They can safely store it without any fear of the invading force stealing it, or the banking system collapsing due to war.”  That said, donors still need to be doing their due diligence to avoid potential scams, particularly in a chaotic active war zone. Nobody should trust a stray crypto wallet floating through social media without corroborating the details. Especially when there are organizations such as The Giving Block, a charity curator that opens up blockchain pathways to nonprofits, which requires a vetting process to be featured on the platform. Even in the wild west of crypto, it is possible for patrons to know their alms are going to the right place – although not all the Ukrainian groups currently accepting crypto donations have opened themselves up to this kind of transparency.  There’s also plenty of evidence that the crypto revolution could threaten the Ukrainian homefront. Foreign policy experts are warning that the Russian economy could become increasingly reliant on the blockchain as crippling sanctions wreak havoc on Moscow. The ruble is worth less than one cent after a 30% swoon after the US and Europe cut off Russian banks from Swift. Crypto is much more resistant to punitive financial assault, and that provides an escape route for a country that’s been completely isolated from civic banking.  “It is most likely already happening. We know Russia is already developing its own digital currency, the digital ruble, that it will use to trade globally. Sanctions aimed at hurting Putin will only hurt the Russian people. What is certain is that Putin has already thought about this prior to the conflict with Ukraine and has a plan that probably involves crypto,” says Mark Bosa, HOKK Finance global brand and business manager.  The war efforts, on both sides, may be funded in the inky blackness of the blockchain. Crypto is often simultaneously a force for good and a force for evil, but the stakes of that dichotomy have never been quite this high. For his part, Schultz intends to keep supporting Ukrainians with his tokens. “Ukraine didn’t want this, and is fighting the battle on their own,” she says. “I wanted to help however I can, by reaching as many as I can.”

But when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed a parliamentary session via video link on Tuesday, something extraordinary happened: the person relaying his words into English was so moved that he audibly fought to hold back his tears. “We’re fighting … just for our land … and for our freedom,” he said, then sniffed, his voice almost breaking as Zelenskiy, wearing a khaki T-shirt in what looked like a bunker, declared: “Despite the fact … that all our cities of our country are now blocked … nobody is going to enter and intervene with the freedom and our country.”  This is just one example among many, of how Vladimir Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine is shaking Europeans to the core. Having long believed that war was impossible on the continent, they are shocked – and embarrassed – that Ukrainians must not only defend their country against Russian aggression, but must also defend democracy, freedom and the right of sovereign states to determine their destiny – the very principles that underpin the European Union.  This war reinforces, with a jolt, the very raison d’etre of the EU as a peace project. After 24 February, no one will again be able to say that the EU’s founding credo, “Never again”, is outdated, and that the EU needs a new narrative to help younger generations – who have no memory of war – relate to European integration.  This is why the 27 member states, notoriously divided and slow when it comes to decision-making in Brussels, are showing such remarkable resolve today – especially over foreign policy and defence, which they traditionally prefer to keep national. In the past week, they have cut off Russian banks from the Swift payment system, financed the procurement of weapons to send to Ukraine (ironically from a fund called the European Peace Facility), blocked the Russian propaganda channels RT and Sputnik, and closed European skies for aircraft to and from Russia. Parliament even applauded the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, although most member states remain sceptical, because this process takes years.  Fuelled by emotion, the European train is rolling so fast that some are cautioning restraint in the face of Putin’s threat of nuclear escalation – emphasising that the US and European countries will not directly fight in Ukraine.  Yet the need for a strong territorial defence now tops the agenda – not just in Germany, which just doubled its defence budget for 2022, but even in militarily neutral Finland and Sweden, which are sending weapons to Ukraine. Neither of these Nordic EU members is in Nato, although both are closely collaborating with it. Public support for Nato membership is markedly growing. In Austria, where anti-Americanism is rife, similar discussions are taking place. A former ambassador to Moscow told public radio that Austrians are suddenly discovering that “Nato is our security”, adding, Das sind neue Zeiten (“This is a new era”).  Putin’s war is now dominating EU debates on a range of other policies. After 15 years of talking, Brussels suddenly agreed to connect Ukraine and Moldova (feared to be next on Putin’s hitlist) to the European electricity grid. EU agriculture ministers have discussed extra supplies of wheat, food and fertiliser to countries that depend on shipments from Ukraine. Even eurozone monetary policies will change. No country will be punished for budget deficits and, with the increasing weaponisation of the world’s reserve currencies, eurozone membership will become more than a form of protection against exchange rate upheavals or a way to foster intra-EU trade – it will be a geopolitical insurance policy. Under these circumstances, Dutch-German resistance to common borrowing (Eurobonds) could melt away.  Poland and Hungary, until now unwilling to welcome refugees, have suddenly opened border crossings to – admittedly –white, Christian ones. Polish workers in Belgium jump in their cars and drive east to help out as Ukrainians flee the fighting. A week of Russian bombardment has driven more than a million people from Ukraine into neighbouring countries of the EU. The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, expects another 4 to 5 million to come In 2015, the arrival of a million Syrian refugees led to political turmoil across Europe; now there is no panic at all. Rather, according to Hugo Brady of the International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna: “Eastern European countries are having their Wir schaffen das moment”.  The German-French writer and political scientist Alfred Grosser wrote in Wie anders sind die Deutschen (How Different Are the Germans?) that Joseph Stalin deserved the first Charlemagne prize for services to European integration, for without the shared, transatlantic fear of communist totalitarianism, “there would never have been a [European] community”.  Fear of Putin now has a similar function. It brings the US and Europe closer together, mutes internal discord in the EU for now, and makes clear that Nato is not, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, once suggested, “brain-dead” but Europe’s ultimate guarantor of peace.  Putin’s invasion “appears to be pushing the EU to centralise more rapidly than before in its history”, Kathleen McNamara and Daniel Kelemen, professors of Georgetown and Rutgers university respectively, argued in the Washington Post this week. For the moment, this is very much the dynamic. Undoubtedly, divisions between EU member states will reappear soon. They always do. And, as always, the EU will deal with them – this is why it was set up in the first place.  But one thing is sure: because of Putin’s war, Europeans have discovered that “Never again” is here again.

Ever since, war has remained one of his main tools, which he has used without flinching throughout his reign. Vladimir Putin exists thanks to war, has thrived through war. Let us now hope that a war will finally bring him down.  In August 1999, a then-unknown Vladimir Putin was named prime minister when his predecessor refused to condone a full reinvasion of Chechnya. Putin, however, was ready, and in return for their unconditional support he granted the military a free rein, allowing them to avenge their humiliating 1996 defeat in blood and fire. On the night of 31 December, an ageing and broken Boris Yeltsin stepped down, handing the presidency like a gift to the newcomer. In March 2000, after famously promising to “grease the terrorists even in the outhouse”, Putin was triumphally elected president. With the exception of his four years as prime minister (2008-2012), he has ruled Russia ever since.  I returned to Chechnya as an aid worker when the second war began. In February 2000, I had dinner with Sergey Kovalev, the great Russian human rights defender, and I asked him the question on everyone’s lips: who was this new unknown president? Who was Putin? I still remember Kovalev’s answer: “You want to know who Vladimir Putin is, young man? Vladimir Putin is a lieutenant colonel of the KGB. And do you know what a lieutenant colonel of the KGB is? Absolutely nothing.” What Kovalev meant was that a man who had never even made full colonel was simply a small-minded operative, incapable of thinking ahead more than a move or two. And while Putin, over his 22 years in power, has grown immensely in stature and experience, I still believe the late Kovalev was fundamentally right.  Putin proved brilliant at exploiting the weakness and divisions of the west  Tactically, however, Putin soon proved brilliant, especially at exploiting the weakness and divisions of the west. It took him years to crush the Chechens and install a puppet regime there, but he succeeded. In 2008, four months after Nato promised a path to accession for Ukraine and Georgia, he gathered his armies for “maneuvers” at the Georgian border and invaded the country in five days, recognizing the independence of two breakaway “republics”. The western democracies mumbled protests, and did practically nothing.  In 2014, when the Ukrainian people, after a bloody revolution, overthrew their pro-Russian president, who had turned his back on Europe fully to align himself with Moscow, Putin swiftly invaded and annexed Crimea, the first overt landgrab in Europe since the second world war. When our leaders, shocked and bewildered, responded with sanctions, he upped the ante and provoked uprisings in Donbas, a Russian-speaking area of Ukraine, using his forces covertly to crush a weak Ukrainian army and carve out two new breakaway “republics”, where a low-level war has simmered ever since.  Thus he began what the French would call his fuite en avant, his “flight forward”. At every step, the west condemned and attempted to punish him, with mild and ineffective measures, in the vain hope of discouraging him. And at every step, he doubled down, and went further.  Growing up in postwar Leningrad clearly taught him a lesson: if you are the smaller boy, hit first, hit hard and keep hitting  Putin is a small man, physically, and growing up in postwar Leningrad must have been tough for him. It clearly taught him a lesson: if you are the smaller boy, hit first, hit hard and keep hitting. And the bigger boys will learn to fear you, and will back off. It is a lesson he has taken to heart. The US’s military budget for 2021 was about $750bn, Europe’s combined budget $200bn, and Russia’s about $65bn. Yet he still scares us a lot more than we scare him. It’s the advantage of fighting like a cornered rat, rather than like a pudgy boy gone soft on a diet of Coca-Cola, Instagram and 80 years of peace in Europe.  Putin must have rejoiced when the west, eager to freeze the active conflict in Donbas, quietly allowed Crimea off the discussion table, effectively conceding the illegal annexation to Russia. He saw that while sanctions hurt, they didn’t bite deep, and would allow him to continue building his military and extending his power. He saw that Germany, the greatest economic power in Europe, was unwilling to wean itself off his gas and his markets. He saw that he could buy European politicians, including former German and French prime ministers, and install them on the boards of his state-controlled companies. He saw that even the countries that nominally opposed his moves still kept repeating the mantras of “diplomacy”, “reset”, “the need to normalize relations”. He saw that each time he pushed, the west would roll over and then come fawning, hoping for an ever-elusive “deal”: Barack Obama, Emmanuel Macron, Donald Trump – the list is long.  Each time he pushed, the west would roll over and then come fawning, hoping for an ever-elusive ‘deal’  Putin began murdering his opponents, at home and abroad. When it happened, we squeaked, but it never went further. When Obama, in 2013, callously ignored his own “red line” in Syria, refusing to intervene after Bashar al-Assad’s poison gassing of a civilian neighborhood in Damascus, Putin paid attention. In 2015, he sent his own forces into Syria, developing his naval base in Tartus and gaining a new air base in Khmeimin. Over the next seven years, he used Syria as a testing ground for his military, granting invaluable field experience to his officer corps and honing their tactics, coordination and equipment, all the while bombing and slaughtering thousands of Syrians, and helping Assad to regain control of large swaths of the country.  In January 2018, he began confronting western powers directly in the Central African Republic, sending his Wagner mercenaries there. The same process is now under way in Mali, where the military junta, with Russian support, has just forced the French anti-Isis mission out of the country. Russia is also actively involved in Libya, foiling western attempts to bring peace to the country, and deploying forces along the southern flank of the Mediterranean, in a position to directly threaten European interests. Every time, we protested, flailed, and did exactly nothing. And every time, he took good note.  Ukraine represents the moment when he finally decided to put his cards on the table. He clearly believes he is strong enough to openly defy the west by launching the first land war in Europe since 1945. And he believes it because everything we have done, or rather failed to do over the last 22 years, has taught him that we are weak.  Putin might be a tactical genius, but he is incapable of thinking strategically. Our leaders have refused to truly understand him, but he has also had no interest in understanding us. Completely isolated for the past two years because of Covid, he seems to have become increasingly paranoid and imbued with his own pan-Slavic, neo-imperialist and Orthodox ideology, originally a wholly artificial creation designed to give a thin veneer of legitimacy to his corrupt regime.  He seems to have truly swallowed his own propaganda when it comes to the Ukrainians. Did he believe they would welcome their Russian “liberators”? That they would just surrender? If he did, he was very wrong. The Ukrainians are fighting, and though outnumbered and outgunned, they are fighting hard. Schoolteachers, office clerks, housewives, artists, students, DJs and drag queens are taking up guns and going out to shoot Russian soldiers, many of whom are mere children who have no idea what they are doing there. Ukraine is not giving up an inch of ground, and it seems Putin will not be able to take their cities without leveling them, as he once leveled Grozny and Aleppo. And do not think that just because Kyiv is a “European” city, Putin will shrink from leveling it. Bombing has already started.  Do not think that just because Kyiv is a ‘European’ city, Putin will shrink from leveling it  After the initial shock, the western democracies – finally! – seem to have understood the existential threat that Putin poses to the postwar world order, to Europe, and to our “way of life” which he so despises. Crushing sanctions are being put into place, no matter what the economic cost to us. Arms are pouring into Ukraine. Germany seems to have realized overnight that it can no longer continue to depend on the kindness of others for its security, and that it needs an army of its own, a real and functional one. Russia is being massively isolated on the international level, and its economy and capacities will be severely diminished.  But this is not enough. As long as Putin remains in power, he will continue to double down, to push further, and to do as much harm as he can. Because he hates the west, and because his power is entirely based on violence: not just the threat, but the systematic use of it. It is the only way he knows how to behave. Can we really believe his nuclear threat is just a bluff? Can we afford to? As long as he continues to rule Russia, no one will be safe. No one.  The only way out of this crisis is to make Putin’s failure in Ukraine so disastrous for Russia and its genuine interests that his own elite will have no choice but to remove him. And for this much more could be done. Our governments seemed focused on punishing the Russian “oligarchs”, but they must understand that Putin has nothing but contempt for them, and doesn’t care a fig for their opinions or their assets; he considers them mere cash cows, there to be milked for his needs.  The western sanctions need to target the people who actually enable Putin’s actions: his entire senior security and administrative apparatus. Not just the few dozen people already targeted, but the thousands of second-tier officials in the presidential administration, the military and the security services. These people are not billionaires, but all are multimillionaires, with much to lose. Ruin the lives of these several thousand people, and let them judge who is to blame. Seize the mansions in England and Spain, forbid the vacations in Courchevel and Sardinia, throw their children unceremoniously out of Harvard and Oxford, and let them stay in Russia, with no way out and no imported goods to spend their stolen money on. Make the cost a real one, a personal one, and let them see if it is worth the price to maintain a deranged, power-hungry tsar on his throne. Let them decide if they want to follow him into the abyss.  Over the past 22 years Russia has fallen prey to a demented, corrupt and totalitarian regime, one we have in many ways facilitated. But it is a great country, one I have loved deeply, and one that has produced wonderful, humane, just men and women. It deserves better than this clique of thieves looting its wealth under the cover of illusory imperial fantasies, and ravaging its neighbors to maintain their grip on total power. Russia deserves freedom, the same freedom Ukraine has painfully obtained over the past three decades. A ceasefire in Ukraine is a vital, urgent first step, and a full Russian withdrawal a second one. But after that, Putin must go.

Indeed, economic warfare has been a central overt aspect of war, especially obvious since the beginning of the 20th century. It still is today, but we call it “sanctions”. But sanctions are a form of war, not an alternative to it, and like war, dangerous, damaging and unpredictable in impact.  On Sunday night and Monday morning, the US and Europe imposed the most crippling and severe sanctions ever levelled against a G20 country. Russia has been treated like Iran, North Korea, Venezuela. Russian money, until recently so eagerly sought, so politically efficacious, not least in London, has been sterilised.  The economic war that the EU and Nato members have launched against Russia is mainly financial, and technological, cutting off the Russia state from its overseas assets, which are now unusable, and preventing it from buying all sorts of critical equipment. The overseas operations of Russian financial institutions have been hobbled and Russian financial institutions expelled from the technical mechanisms of global capitalism. The consequences have been clear, a huge devaluation of the rouble, a doubling of rouble interest rates, potential runs on domestic banks, and the possibility of inflation. The Russian state has been financially disarmed, externally at least.  The attack is not a total one, quite deliberately so. Russia can still sell its two main exports for hard cash, energy and grain, but that is a measure of the strength of the west. It does not want to deprive the world economy of supplies at a time of rising commodity prices. But who is in charge is completely clear, and what expectations are also. Foreign investors in Russia are pulling out as best they can, like BP and Shell, and cultural and sporting bodies are acting to ban Russia. Social media imposes controls, mendacious broadcasters banned.  What this episode reveals if nothing else is that if we choose to do so the power of money can be silenced, markets can not only be bucked, but directly and powerfully manipulated. The great financial crisis and Covid both launched complex financial engineering measures to keep economies going, now they have been inverted to crash and control one from the outside, a trickier task. As James Meadway suggests, something like this has been threatened before, but doing it is a different matter. The state is back, and international coordination and cooperation too, with the two of the three great economic blocs in the world working in concert.  The belief that international trade would be so good for all, that no sane person would ever start a war again was, in the words of Norman Angell, the Great Illusion. But there was always another much darker side to this coin. It was that if one cut a belligerent nation out of international trade the economic and social consequences would be so awful it would be forced to cease fighting. Economic warfare was indeed thought of as a weapon of mass destruction, as Nicholas Mulder’s brilliant and timely history tells us. This was especially true of the liberal internationalists of the interwar years, once lazily thought of as pacifists, who saw sanctions (and a bit of international airpower) not so much as alternatives to war, but rather particularly devastating forms of war whose threatened use would maintain a liberal world order. They had some justification for thinking this. The blockade of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the great war had itself killed hundreds of thousands.  But the second world war demonstrated the limitations as well as the possibilities of economic warfare. The British launched economic war against Germany in 1939, driving German trade off the surface of much of the earth, and especially from 1940, preventing neutral trade with German-dominated Europe. They attacked Germany’s supply of iron ore from Sweden, leading to Germany’s invasion of Norway. Strategic bombing, thought of as an extension of blockade, was also launched in 1940. But Germany knew what was coming, and partly for that reason had made a deal with the USSR, and later invaded it. The imposition of oil sanctions on Japan in 1940 led to it attacking the US, British and Dutch empires in the east in December 1941. It took years of war and sanctions to crush the German and Japanese economies, even though the allied United Nations controlled all the rest of the world economy.  After the war, cold war went with hot sanctions. The iron and bamboo curtains were heavily policed economic and technological barriers. And since the end of the cold war sanctions continued to be used, indeed extended. They have proved damaging, and indeed deadly to people, though not to regimes. Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Syria, Venezuela, North Korea, Afghanistan are or have been subject to sanctions, often for years. Russia too has been sanctioned since 2014. But sanctions have probably not been the worst causes of economic collapse. Russia, after 1989, lost perhaps half its GDP per capita, which did not return to Soviet levels until around 2005. This economic catastrophe created Putinism. Covid itself had an enormous impact on much of the world economy, but has changed little else.  Sanctions are seen as alternative to war, more readily voted for. But they are aggressive actions, and are like wars in that they are costly affairs. Effective sanctions require serious economic and political intelligence, the capacity and willingness to act against evasions and to bear the cost they impose on the imposer. Sanctions are, like war, a matter of alliances. In the second world war, the United Nations dominated the world economy, to an extent that today’s Nato/EU cannot match. Interdicting the Spanish merchant marine during the second world war was a very different matter from bringing China into anti-Russia sanctions today. On the other hand today Russia has an economy smaller than Italy’s.  How effective sanctions could be in crippling an economy like the Russian one remains to be seen. After all, it is much easier to affect financial instruments than the real economy, and trade is not everything for a country as geographically large as Russia. As was found during the second world war sanctions don’t simply take a chunk out of an economy, they force it to change, to emphasise self-sufficiency. Sanctions force states into internal transformation and repression. They also lead to counter sanctions, and to military threats. Thus Germany, a very much larger economy than Russia, is not only imposing sanctions, but preparing to diversify its energy supply, and to nearly double its defence budget, which would make it very much larger than Russia’s. Putin’s crime is thus not just a matter of attempting to take over Ukraine, but turning the world once more into one with surging military expenditure and warring political economic blocs.  But we also need to look at the political logics that may play out. While there is a possibility that these events will boost the standing of western militarists, those who would have us continue to engage in permanent war, another possibility is there. For who are the enemies this time? They are neither communists nor Islamists nor Arab nationalists. They are white nationalists, producers of fossil fuels, kleptocrats, near climate denialists, critics of what they call gender ideology and practiced and fluent liars. It is not just Putin who should be scared, but all the mini-Putins he has inspired, in power in London, Brasília, Budapest, Warsaw and Riyadh, and recently in Washington. This has the potential not only of turning into a global campaign against fossil fuels and kleptocratic tax havens, but might arouse the wrath of the woke against the neofascist international of our time. But we must beware, for the liberal internationalist drive to sanctions and to war, usually illegal, has already blighted the lives of millions in the 21st century. We should remember that war itself is a crime, not merely the site of potential war crimes.

For two full days residents had not been allowed to go out, even during the daytime. Russian saboteur groups were identified, and random street fights took place.  I did not recognise my city, with checkpoints in the old town, with people digging trenches, bridges being fortified and the subway turned into a bomb shelter.  A huge crowd, up to 500 people, lined up to volunteer for the territorial defence unit in one of the neighbourhoods.  “Do you enrol everybody who shows up?” we asked a young guy in charge. “Almost all, but I do not accept those under 18,” he said. “And there are a lot of them. I wouldn’t be able to look their mothers in the eyes. I fought in 2014-2015 in Donbas, so I know what the war is.”  It’s a predominantly male group but there are three women. The youngest is a lawyer. “What Russia has already done to the civilians has made us act,” she said. She had not told her family of her decision to fight. They live in a small town on the Ukrainian-Russian border, which has been partially destroyed. Another woman, in her 60s, said she was a nurse. Her husband had joined the defence units and she felt she needed to be with him. The last was a retired officer. She enrolled because her son had already joined the Ukrainian army. “When our grandparents, who remember the second world war, were wishing for peace, we didn’t understand why,” she said. “But now I know.”  The figures say one thing, experience another. The official toll of civilian deaths is 350, but after seven days’ fighting, there cannot be a single Ukrainian who doesn’t know somebody who has been touched by tragedy. There are more than 1,600 wounded.  “That’s my classmate,” one colleague wrote, on seeing the front page of the Guardian, with a photo showing a woman wounded by shrapnel during the first attacks in Chuguev, on the eastern border. Elena Kurilova is not well. She can’t see with her left eye, and it’s getting worse. Her daughter, whose Instagram account looks like that of a beauty blogger, now livestreams with her mother in bandages to prove to Russian commentators that the injuries are real; her mother is not a fake.  One of the flats destroyed belongs to a colleague in Kyiv. It was hit by a rocket and she circulates the pictures, but first she complains how unfair it is that Russian media have used pictures of her flat to accuse Ukraine of bombing its own people.  “Those of you who have come to ‘rescue us’, just go away,” cries a woman holding a baby at Kyiv’s main station. “We were all right before you came. Just leave. All I have is some cash and a backpack.” Like thousands of people here, her mission is to go somewhere else, anywhere. The Ukrainian railway allows everybody to ride without tickets, including foreign citizens, and is running extra trains to the west.  We count the hours: seven, 20, 70, 100, 144: hours of the Ukrainian army on its own, its citizens holding off one of the mightiest armies in the world, which is now being bolstered by support from Belarus. The count becomes symbolic. For those under bombardment, each hour seems like a year.  The primary Russian target is the capital, and that army has been struggling to take it, but the fight is also a fierce one in many small towns whose names are never mentioned in the headlines. Irpin, Hostomel, Bucha were all attacked, but not captured.  In Vasylkiv, on the Stuhna river, the college where IT specialists, construction workers, chefs and barbers study and train has been destroyed. Luckily 18 people who were staying in the college’s dorm were evacuated. The director of the college, Liudmyla Postolenko, walks through the debris, showing a damaged hall that had only recently been renovated. “Thank God, all are alive,” she says. “But our hearts are broken. Our kids are crying … But, you know, among our students there are construction workers, welders – so we will rebuild. What we need to do is care, and support those who are fighting.”  Two weeks before the invasion, when things were still calm, I travelled to a town in Donbas and met a friend: a humanitarian worker from Kyiv, who had moved there after the start of the fighting. He took a day to walk around the city “to say goodbye to the last peaceful days”. He was confident, as were many, that the Ukrainian army, which managed to defend and take over towns in the area eight years ago, was in better shape. Still, while walking in a chilly but tranquil industrial town, he took pictures to remember. With every shot I felt more anger. I didn’t want to accept the notion of saying goodbye to peace.  Driving through Kyiv, I film the queues outside the pharmacies and shops. The scenes in heavily shelled areas are surreal. The post office window has been broken for four days but no one has looted it. The computers and parcels are all perfectly in place.  I film the billboards above the roads. They’re written in Russian, saying: “Russian soldier, stop! How can you look into your kids’ eyes? Remain human”; “Russian soldier, stop! Do not kill your soul for Putin’s oligarchs. Leave without blood on your hands.” There are details of the deal being offered by Ukraine’s defence minister to Russian conscripts: 5m roubles for anybody prepared to lay down their arms.  I take photos of random buildings: Kyiv zoo, the opera house, my former office. The next day, they may not be there.  For months before Putin’s air force attacked Ukraine, I was being asked by those abroad why Ukrainians were not panicking. I said we were not scared and that the source of our confidence was a belief that we could prove to Russia that in the long run we were unconquerable.  And in the first days of the invasion, when civilians were killed by airstrikes that mainly missed their targets, it seemed clear that the Kremlin blitzkrieg was not working. But the cruise missiles that killed people in Freedom Square in Kharkiv, in the north-east, in the hospitals in Zhytomyr in the west, and in the residential areas in Mariupol in the south, showed us that the strategy has changed: now the plan is to terrify Ukrainians into submission. And this is just the beginning.  Looking at the courage, unity, support and the heroics of our troops, 90% of Ukrainians believe Ukraine will win. The question is the price.  Seven days were enough to get used to sirens and bomb shelters; a new reality in which I did not walk outside without a flak jacket. In a few days we might need to get used to life without electricity or running water. Ukrainians are ready for that.  But the loss of all the lives feels different. These are losses that could and should have been prevented. They are something neither we nor the outside world should get used to.

The French president said the conflict had “changed the era” across the continent and that he would be calling a summit of European leaders next week to discuss how to address the “unprecedented challenge” it created.  In a 14-minute address on prime-time television, he warned France faced upheaval and higher prices and that the country and its European partners had to invest to wean themselves off Russian gas and become self-sufficient in energy production as well as address defence issues and questions about food production.  “We can no longer depend on others to feed us, care for us, inform us, finance us,” Macron said. “We cannot depend on others to defend us, whether on land, at sea, under the sea, in the air, in space or in cyberspace. In this respect, our European defence must take a new step forward.”  He added: “War in Europe no longer belongs in our history books or schoolbooks, it is here, before our eyes. Democracy is no longer considered an unquestionable system, it is questioned, before our eyes. Our freedom, that of our children, is no longer a given.  “To this brutal return of tragedy in history, we must respond with historic decisions.”  Macron, who last month had shuttled between Moscow and Kyiv attempting unsuccessfully to prevent the Russian invasion, placed the blame for the war firmly in Putin’s hands, saying Europe and Nato had “done everything to prevent it”.  “President Putin chose war … alone, in a deliberate manner and by going back on engagements made to the United Nations. This war is not a conflict between Nato and the west on one side and Russia on the other; there are no Nato troops or bases in Ukraine. That’s just lies. Russia is not being aggressed, it is the aggressor,” he said.  03:15 What exactly does Putin want in Ukraine? – video explainer  “This war is even less what the unfounded propaganda would have you believe, a fight against Nazism. That’s a lie; an insult to the history of Russia and Ukraine, to the memory of our elders who fought side by side against the Nazis. Russian leaders are attacking the memory of the Holocaust in Ukraine as they attack the memory of the crimes of Stalinism in Russia,” Macron added.  He accused Putin of having a “revisionist reading of the history of Europe that wants to take us back to the darkest hours of empire, invasions and exterminations”.  Macron has said France will welcome Ukrainian refugees and he described the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as “the face of honour, of liberty, or bravery”. The president’s sombre and statesmanlike address on Wednesday evening came as he is expected to announce he is standing for re-election. Candidates have until 6pm French time on Friday to declare.  The most recent opinion poll, carried out before his national address, suggests the president is enjoying an unprecedented surge in support, with 28% of voters saying they will support him in the first round election next month, well ahead of his closest rival, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, on 17%.  However, Macron warned there was economic pain to come; the war would hit French agriculture, industry and all economic sectors dependent on the import of raw materials or export of goods to Russia and Ukraine, he said.  “The rise in the price of petrol, gas, raw materials will have consequences on our spending power; in future, the price of a tank of petrol, the heating bill, the cost of certain products risks being even higher. Faced with these social and economic consequences, I have but one aim: to protect you.”  He said the prime minister, Jean Castex, had been tasked with drawing up an “economic and social resilience plan” to address the difficulties faced by the public.  Russia’s attack on Ukraine has given weight to Macron’s long-held belief that the EU should have its own joint defence force. In a major speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris shortly after he was elected in 2017, he said the EU should have “autonomous capacity for action” through a joint military force, shared defence budget and a common defence policy. Any new EU force would be a complement, not a rival, to Nato, he said.

Officers are treating the death of 66-year-old Mikhail Watford, who made his fortune in oil and gas after the demise of the Soviet Union, as unexplained. But they said it was not thought to be suspicious.  The news comes as attention focuses on oligarchs in the UK who are thought to be members of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  It follows the attempted murder on UK soil of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, which the Kremlin is accused of ordering, as well as other attacks blamed on Russian authorities.  There is no suggestion, however, that Watford has been the target of British-backed sanctions owing to a proximity to Putin, or of a Russian operation.  Surrey police said his body was found on Monday at an address near Virginia Water, between Slough and Woking, to the west of London.  “We were called around midday on Monday 28 February following reports of the discovery of a man’s body at an address in Portnall Drive, Wentworth,” a spokesperson said.  “An ambulance was called but the man, who was in his 60s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin are aware and are being supported by specially trained officers. An investigation into the circumstances of the death is under way but it is not believed there are any suspicious circumstances at this time.”  Watford was born Mikhail Tolstosheya in Ukraine in 1955, during the country’s Soviet era. He was commonly known as Misha and, according to the Sunday Times, anglicised his surname after moving to the UK. He initially settled in London, where he lived with his Estonian wife, Jane, before moving to Surrey.  The paper reported that Watford considered that his childhood, spent in a “big four-bedroom apartment with a bath, and a car,” was very comfortable in Soviet-era Ukraine. “In terms of luxury, [it] was the equivalent of travelling by jet now,” he told the paper in 2015.  His mother, who the Sun reported lived in a neighbouring apartment in his villa and was at home when his body was found, was said to have insisted on keeping her Soviet ID in a safe. “She strongly believes communists will be back to Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, she’s enjoying modest spending of her capitalist son’s money … And we are praying her dream never comes true,” Watford told the Sunday Times.  According to the paper, he had three children: Michael, his son by his first marriage; his and Jane’s daughter, Michelle; and their youngest, Alexander.

Newcastle remains under a severe weather warning with falls of 60 to 100mm possible over six hours and the associated risk of flash flooding.  Major flooding also remained possible at Windsor on the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, thanks to heavy rains in the surrounding catchment areas. The major flooding at North Richmond may be close to its peak, the bureau said in its most recent update on Thursday afternoon.  Authorities had to prepare for the worst as Warragamba Dam west of Sydney started spilling on Wednesday, but rainfalls were less than expected.  The gauge at the dam itself collected 237mm in the 48 hours to 9am Thursday, but just 5mm up to Thursday 3pm, Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone, said.  The east coast low developed into three separate areas of circulation just off the coast.  “That means it’s not a strong and well-defined low pressure system, and this is weakening near the coast,” Domensino said.  The Hunter will see ongoing rain, but for Sydney and the Central Coast there should only be showers. Showers near Sydney “won’t be doing too much to raise river levels”, he said.  However, there was another upper-level low pressure system crossing south-eastern Australia this weekend.  “Some models are suggesting that will cause heavier rain to redevelop from Sunday over eastern NSW and into Monday, with the potential for another low pressure system forming near the coast early next week on Monday or Tuesday.”  Earlier on Thursday, about half a million people across NSW were under evacuation orders or warnings as the wild weather that battered parts of eastern Australia for a week bore down on the greater Sydney region.  Steph Cooke, NSW’s emergency services minister, said the state had 76 evacuation orders in place on Thursday morning affecting 200,000 people, with a further 18 evacuation warnings covering about 300,000 residents.  “We have 500,000 people in our state right now who are either the subject of an evacuation warning or an evacuation,” Cooke said.  The evacuation orders covered areas of northern NSW and parts of the greater Sydney region and the Illawarra.  The Bureau of Meteorology issued multiple warnings for rivers to flood and for severe weather to affect a region of eastern NSW from near Taree, north of Newcastle, down almost to Moruya Heads on the south coast.  Flood warnings were in place for the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers near Sydney, prompting many of the evacuations overnight, but also for the Wilsons, Richmond and Clarence rivers in northern NSW, where there have been record floods.  Warragamba Dam west of Sydney was spilling at a rate of 225 gigalitres a day with a predicted peak rate of 300-350GL a day – half the worst-case scenario.  That meant thousands of households and businesses could avoid damaging flooding from the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers north-west of Sydney.  A cyclist rides through flood waters in Manly on Thursday. Photograph: Lee Hulsman/Getty Images  The BoM noted major flooding continued along the Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean rivers, however.  “River levels are continuing to rise at Windsor where major flooding may develop Thursday evening,” the bureau said. “Further heavy rainfall is forecast today and into Friday which may result in extended and possibly higher major flood peaks. River levels at North Richmond are expected to remain below those observed during the March 2021 event.”  The NSW State Emergency Services had received a total of 11,747 requests for help since the start of the floods crisis, with 1,462 calls coming since 3.30pm on Wednesday.  The Insurance Council of Australia said insurers have received 60,163 claims related to the ongoing flooding in south-east Queensland and NSW.  About 83% of total claims relate to property with the remainder for motor vehicles, the ICA said. “Based on previous flood events the current cost of claims is estimated to be about $900m,” the council said on Thursday.  The heavy rain and potentially damaging winds and dangerous surf were the result of an east coast low that was located about 100km east of Newcastle at 6am on Thursday.  SES personnel and police watch the rising flood water on the Hawkesbury River in Windsor on Wednesday night. Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian  Sydney’s forecast had been revised lower to between 50mm and 90mm of rain from an earlier prediction of 100mm to 150mm on Thursday, as the low looks likely to cross the coast farther north. There remained the chance of a possibly severe thunderstorm.    Where thunderstorms form, there is the risk of locally intense rainfall, reaching as much as 200mm over six hours, leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, according to the bureau.  Many schools were closed across NSW and the SES was encouraging people in affected areas to avoid all non-essential travel.  Rainfall in the 24 hours from 9am Wednesday topped 100mm in areas of Sydney’s south, west and north-west, while the central business district collected about 50mm.  Warragamba Dam spilling, with the government on Wednesday saying the worst case could see as much as 600 gigalitres a day flow over the wall. During the March 2021 floods, the spill rate got to 440-460GL. pic.twitter.com/vnqiprJlwV — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) March 2, 2022  The NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, said on Wednesday the worst-case scenario was for Warragamba Dam to spill at 600GL a day. That would have been well above the 440GL to 460GL a day peak rate during the March 2021 floods.  The Warragamba spill will add to other flows coming into the Hawkesbury-Neapean River. At North Richmond, one area being evacuated, the flow is already above major flood levels. @BOM_NSW @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/26TUWigqTl — Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) March 2, 2022  The @BOM_au is forecasting the Hawkesbury-Nepean River to approach or exceed the March 2021 flood peaks.

Similar big flooding events around the world have followed such patterns.  “There is a climate change signal in atmospheric rivers, and that’s been one of the components of this event.”

The Boris Vilkitskiy was on its way to the Isle of Grain with a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, owing to an apparent loophole on Russian-associated ships imposed by the Department for Transport.  But after dockers represented by the trade union Unison warned they would rebel against any instruction to help bring the gas onshore, the ship will no longer dock at the Kent facility.  Tankers carrying oil and gas are still arriving at or heading towards ports around the country, including Foyle Port in Derry and Liverpool. But National Grid, which operates the Isle of Grain LNG terminal, confirmed it was now no longer expecting any deliveries of Russian gas.  “This will come as a relief to the Grain terminal workers,” said Matt Lay, Unison’s national officer for energy. “But while it looks like the union’s intervention has been successful in seeing these ships turned away, a more fundamental problem remains.”  He pointed out that ships carrying Russian oil and gas are still able to dock at British ports because the DfT’s ban does not cover the origin of vessels’ cargo, despite the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, saying earlier this week that the measure extended to “all ships with any Russian connection whatsoever”.  “The government must act immediately to close this loophole and stop Russian goods continuing to arrive in the UK under the cover of another country,” said Lay.  While the Boris Vilkitskiy will no longer dock at Isle of Grain, a tanker called the Pluto was moored at Foyle Port on Thursday, while the Seacod, bringing oil from the Primosk terminal that accounts for 30% of Russian oil exports, was anchored off Liverpool.  The UK could spend an average of more than £6m a day on Russian gas this year, according to analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).  They estimated the spend would reach £2.3bn this year at a wholesale gas price of 200p/therm, if imports continue at the rate seen in 2021.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  “Although not at the same level of some other European countries, the UK has been spending billions of pounds on Russian gas that could now be being used to fund Putin’s war in Ukraine,” said Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, the unit’s head of analysis.  “This is another reason why the UK needs to break its dependency on gas – and insulating our homes, deploying electric heat pumps and shifting from gas power stations to renewables is the way to do it.”  The analysis came as the International Energy Agency released a 10-point plan for reducing the European Union’s reliance on supplies controlled by the Kremlin.

Taking his cue from Bela Lugosi, Gillis nails the brooding bloodsucker persona, as well as his co-stars.  19 Richard Roxburgh in Van Helsing (2004)  Gussied up in edgy earrings and a greasy ponytail, Roxburgh looks like a superannuated Bono, while his hammy performance makes him seem less like a dangerous suitor and more a tiresome party bore. His big set piece, the vampire ball, rips off the far superior Dance of the Vampires.  18 Paul Naschy in El Gran Amor del Conde Drácula (1973)  The beefy Spanish horror legend Naschy, better known for his wolfman roles, plays a sincere, melancholy count posing as the head of a Transylvanian sanatorium. Can the four stranded beauties in low-cut Little Bo Peep costumes help him reincarnate his dead daughter? Blood rituals and bare bosoms galore!  17 Gerard Butler in Dracula 2000 (2000)  Gerard Butler in Dracula 2000. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy  Also known as Dracula 2001 or 2002, depending on your country’s release date. Hi-tech thieves unwittingly transport Dracula’s coffin to New Orleans, where Virgin Megastore promises to cater to his needs. Pre-fame Butler, yet to acquire action-man clout, lacks gravitas, but the origin story is ingenious.  16 Luke Evans in Dracula Untold (2014)  Untold? By 2014, we had seen Vlad “the Impaler” Țepeș impaling Turks and going full-on vampire a zillion times, albeit not set almost entirely in a CGI-heavy 15th century. Evans is more ripped superhero than fearsome demon – and a good enough actor to deserve a better vampire vehicle.  15 Shin Kishida in Lake of Dracula (1971) and Evil of Dracula (1974)  Watch the trailer for Evil of Dracula.  Michio Yamamoto’s “bloodthirsty trilogy”, influenced more by Hammer than by homegrown Japanese mythology, merges British-style gothic and the landscape of Honshu with slow-moving but unheimlich results. Kishida plays “the Vampire” as a growlym whey-faced vampire with golden eyes and also the devious principal of a young ladies’ academy.  14 George Hamilton in Love at First Bite (1979)  “Children of the night … shut up!” This dated but disarming romcom is a better Mel-Brooks-style spoof than Brooks’ own Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Hamilton’s unfeasibly suntanned count gets hounded out of Transylvania by communists and moves to Manhattan in pursuit of a cover girl (Susan Saint James).  13 Zhang Wei-Qiang in Dracula: Pages from a Virgin’s Diary (2002)  Zhang Wei-Qiang in Dracula: Pages from a Virgin’s Diary. Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy  The oddball Canadian director Guy Maddin applies his fuzzy-focus quasi-silent movie style to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s production of Bram Stoker’s story, set to Mahler in monochrome with flashes of colour. Highlights are Lucy and Mina’s dreamlike duets with the seductive stranger from the east, who bleeds gold coins when stabbed.  12 John Carradine in House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945)  Carradine’s gaunt face, staring eyes and dapper moustache make him an ideal second-tier Dracula. He played the character several times, notably in two of Universal’s multimonster meets, where he is a bit of a ladies’ man (admittedly helped by hypnotic powers), but easily defeated by exposure to sunlight.  11 Jack Palance in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1974)  Jack Palance in Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy  Palance, with genuine Slavic cheekbones (his parents were Ukrainian), was an obvious choice for the title role in Dan Curtis’s chatty telefilm. Richard Matheson’s script is the first to connect Dracula to Vlad the Impaler, who believes Lucy is his lost soulmate. It was also the first time Stoker got a title credit.  10 Udo Kier in Blood for Dracula (1974)  Dracula, sickly for lack of nourishment, travels to 1920s Italy in a desperate quest for the blood of “wirgins” – only to find his prospective victims deflowered by virile communist handyman Joe Dallesandro. Paul Morrissey’s companion piece to Flesh for Frankenstein is camp, silly and beautiful, with Kier oozing pathos as a decadent blood junkie running out of time.  9 Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)  Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Photograph: Columbia/Allstar  Francis Ford Coppola’s sumptuous melodrama takes its cues from the 1974 telefilm as Dracula winds up in Victorian England and fixates on the woman he believes is his reincarnated paramour. When not morphing into rats or green mist, Oldman’s low-key Dracula tends to be upstaged by Eiko Ishioka’s spectacular costumes. Worse, Oldman is so lovelorn that he is not at all scary.  8 Claes Bang in The Rules of the Beast (2020)  Forgive the cheating, but I am counting the first and best episode of the three-part BBC mini-series (from the people who brought you Sherlock) as a standalone feature. Bang starts off wrinkly and gets younger as he drains Jonathan Harker of his blood. This Dracula is a loquacious, feral parasite, authentically malignant and never remotely human.  7 Frank Langella in Dracula (1979)  Langella reprises the role he played in a 1970s Broadway revival of the 1920s play (Raul Julia, Terence Stamp and Jeremy Brett also played it on stage). John Badham’s film amps up the count’s romantic side, all hand-kissing and come-hither gazing, leading to semi-psychedelic love scenes. It is only Langella’s contemporary bouffant that lets the side down.  6 Lon Chaney Jr in Son of Dracula (1943)  Lon Chaney Jr and Louise Allbritton in Son of Dracula. Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy  Received wisdom has it that the plebeian-looking Chaney is miscast as “Count Alucard” in Robert Siodmak’s contribution to Universal’s monsterverse. But think of him as the lovestruck patsy of a film noir femme fatale and he becomes an almost tragic figure. Just watch him rising from the swamp to embrace her, unaware the minx is already plotting his downfall …  5 Louis Jourdan in Count Dracula (1977)  This epic-length TV film is one of the most faithful adaptations of Stoker’s novel. Jourdan plays Dracula as an ageing, slightly regretful matinee idol (with hairy palms!) who relishes his lack of reflection instead of trying to hide it. The special effects are primitive by today’s standards, but the sight of Jourdan crawling down his castle wall is truly unnerving.  4 Klaus Kinski in Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)  Werner Herzog goaded Kinski into throwing his daily tantrums before shooting, so the actor would be exhausted by the time the cameras rolled. This resulted in one of his more restrained performances, as a plague spreader tormented by helpless envy of the humans upon whom he preys. Not so much a remake of the 1922 classic as an elegant reframing of it.  3 Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931)  Bela Lugosi in Dracula. Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/Re  After 90 years taking in Hammer, Lestat de Lioncourt and Twilight, it is Lugosi – with his tuxedo, piercing gaze and menacing Hungarian accent – who remains the archetypal Dracula. The Spanish version, shot at night on the same sets, might be the more visually fluent film, but its star, Carlos Villarías, is no substitute for Lugosi in his signature role.  2 Max Schreck in Nosferatu (1922)  Schreck plays Dracula in all but name – he is Graf Orlok, possibly for copyright reasons. A hideous bald cadaver with pointy teeth, he is the perfect antidote to pretty-boy vampires, although it doesn’t stop the self-sacrificing heroine surrendering herself to him with an erotic abandon notably lacking from the scenes with her human husband.  1 Christopher Lee in Dracula (1958) and multiple sequels  The true successor to Schreck and Lugosi played Dracula more than any other actor, including in a Jerry Lewis comedy, with a grey moustache in Jess Franco’s Count Dracula (1970) and speaking French in Dracula Père et Fils (1976). But it was in Hammer’s dark fairytales that Lee made the character his own: tall, dark and fanged, an impeccable combination of sexy and scary.

Almost every show to hit it big so far this year has had a gruesome element of real-life deceit to it. There was The Tinder Swindler documentary, then Inventing Anna. And now Worst Roommate Ever.  You may already have seen Worst Roommate Ever, because it is in Netflix’s top 10. And if you have watched it, there is a chance that this will be because the concept of bad roommates is universal. One old roommate of mine, for instance, locked himself out, smashed a window to get in then refused to pay for repairs. Another shaved his beard into the sink and didn’t clean up. Terrible behaviour. The worst.  And so with some dismay – and a thudding inevitability – I learned that Worst Roommate Ever is just a true-crime documentary. That’s it. A cookie-cutter, assembly-line, true-crime documentary so blindingly impersonal that it feels as if it was conceived by robots.  Broadly speaking, all four cases covered in the series (the last is a two-parter, but we’ll come to that in a moment) are about people who abused positions of trust. They moved in with people – or people moved in with them – and then, whether by obsession or design or lifelong compulsion, murdered them. One is a nice old lady, a Gus Fring-type who revelled in philanthropy outwardly despite being a serial killer. Another is a man who fell in love with his roommate with terrible consequences. Another appeared to model his behaviour on Michael Keaton’s character in Pacific Heights. You get the picture.  My feelings are that, if you’re going to dedicate several man hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to telling a story about a real person whose life was forcibly ended in one of the most unthinkable ways possible, try to show a bit of respect. The BBC’s recent The Hunt for Bible John was a perfect example, taking care to put the murders into social and economic context, highlighting the frustrations of the detectives, and most importantly showing the howling vacuum left by the murder.  Worst Roommate Ever does not do this. It’s called Worst Roommate Ever, for crying out loud. You cannot conceivably make a true-crime documentary that respects the dead if its title could just as conceivably be used for a gameshow. And that goes double when barely any time has passed since the crime actually took place. One murder in this series happened five years ago. That’s barely enough to process any death at all, not least one marked by unimaginable violence. After five years you can still feel the tendrils of the life unlived. But whoops! Worst Roommate Ever!  The stories aren’t well told, either. We see the person who definitely did it, meet the investigating officer who knows immediately that the person did it, then they’re arrested. There’s no cat and mouse to any of it, because the mouse is dead and the cat is in a boredom-induced coma.  Most sadly of all, something salvageable does exist at the centre of Worst Roommate Ever. The final story, told across two episodes, does genuinely appear to be about the worst roommate who ever lived; a serial lodger who first moved in with, then blithely intimidated, a succession of ruined housemates. By some degree, his is the most attention-worthy story of the four. You can’t help but wonder if the producers would have been better off doing more work on this story and jettisoning the others. It still would have been miserable and condescending, and designed to only appeal to the lowest common denominator, but crucially it would have been shorter.  If you haven’t already dipped your toes into Worst Roommate Ever, my advice would be not to bother. At the rate things are going, it’ll only be a minute or two before Netflix’s next glibly patronising true-crime documentary hits our screens.

Announcement of the plan follows promises made in Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech late on Tuesday, which emphasized rapid rollout of a new “test to treat” model with free anti-viral pills after a positive test.  This comes just a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) loosened mask guidance nationally, as more and more Democratic leaders have lifted pandemic-era restrictions and with the president urging workers to return to the office in-person.  “We are moving forward safely, getting back to our more normal routines, and under the latest CDC recommendations most Americans in most of the country can now be mask-free,” said the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients. Vaccinated Americans, he said, “have an extremely high level of protection against Covid, and it’s extremely unlikely you’ll end up in the hospital if you get the virus”.  The administration’s plan has four main pillars: protect against and treat Covid-19 cases, prepare for new variants, prevent business and school closures and continue to distribute vaccines globally. Within those pillars are a mix of short- and long-term goals, many of which will require congressional funding.  In the short-term, a “test to treat” model is expected to be rolled out this month. The model will allow people to be tested for Covid-19 and receive antiviral medication in “one step” at pharmacies, veterans’ centers and long-term care facilities nationally. The White House has also said it will seek to buy more vaccines, treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and antiviral pills, and tests and masks.  Beyond the short-term goals, administration officials proposed a slate of long-term investments, including research for a pan-Covid-19 vaccine, national “centers of excellence” to treat so-called long Covid, and the ability to develop, manufacture and approve a vaccine within 100 days should a new variant arise.  “We will have to contend with Covid at some level for some time to come,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser. “This ongoing research investment is not only helping us turn the corner on Covid-19, but is vital to helping us prepare for future pandemics.”  However, how much funding the administration is asking for remains unclear. Zients said the White House would “communicate that number to Congress” as it is finalized. It has already briefed congressional leaders on the need for short-term purchases.  The White House announcement and State of the Union address also came with a new look and feel. At the State of the Union, Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, were all mask-free. So, too, were White House officials when they announced the new Covid-19 plan, notably in-person rather than through a group video call.  The White House has said repeatedly this is not a plan to “live with Covid”, any more than Americans “accept ‘living with’ cancer, Alzheimer’s, or Aids”.  The new strategic footing from the administration has received a mixed response. Some public health leaders reacted with excitement to the “test to treat” plan, but revised CDC guidance has received a more tepid response.  Critics have argued that the widespread end of masking shifts the burden of preventing Covid-19 to “vulnerable individuals”, and could be premature given past pandemic surges. However, the mood of the country may have already shifted – Americans of every political stripe have reported a high degree of frustration and exhaustion with the pandemic, according to recent surveys.  Progress to global vaccination has been slow, putting the world at risk of new variants. To date, 64.4% of the world has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, but there is a gulf between high- and low-income countries. Just 13% of people in low-income nations have received a vaccine, compared with 79% in high- and upper-middle-income nations.

On the sidelines you have a job to do in what I called a new department. That is a bit of an exaggeration. I see the address and the telephone number are the same Cabinet Office occupied by David Frost, your predecessor.  You are, realistically, the fifth holder of that office in six years. David Davis was appointed by Theresa May to the Department for Exiting the European Union in 2016, followed by Dominic Raab and then Stephen Barclay before it was closed in 2020. It popped up again when Lord Frost was given the grand title of minister of state in the Cabinet Office with oversight of trade and cooperation agreement and withdrawal agreement. He packed it in at the end of last year, complaining to the prime minister about the direction of travel.  Now the prime minister has demonstrated great faith in you not only to conjure up the potential of Brexit but, at the same time, to improve government efficiency. I would quietly postpone this aspect of your title if I were you. The chancellor would make a bad enemy when you start poking about in the Treasury to try to find the millions lost to fraud. Perish the thought, but perhaps that’s why the prime minister gave you the title in the first place!  You are right about the need to secure cuts by controlling recruitment. Margaret Thatcher was so impressed by the way I did this that she asked me to present my methods to a special meeting of the cabinet. That proved disastrous when the great figures of the time were told by this young ex-businessman that they had to micromanage their departments.  The officials advising you won’t have changed much, and that seems to me to be your first problem. I served in different departments for 19 years. I well remember the first day in each new job. There were all those files bursting with outstanding jobs, with new proposals and with lists of manifesto commitments yet to be fulfilled. Sometimes I was even asked if I had any ideas of my own. It all added up to a formidable workload. You will want to be cautious. You are not the first to seek Brexit gold at the rainbow’s end. Theresa May rightly put Eurosceptic colleagues Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox into the top jobs. Davis resigned because May’s deal was no good. Fox said it was the only deal on offer. Johnson left both out of his government and was denounced publicly by Davis in the House of Commons in consequence.  Five years after the EU referendum, the baton has passed to you and your Cabinet Office team.  Your friends and your supporters in the media will have warned you about these officials. They are an inert, inactive blob, remoaners to every last man and woman, they will say. That is why you have been put in charge. Even a machine as excellent as a Rolls-Royce goes nowhere unless the driver chooses the direction and fills the tank.  That is why your appeal to the people themselves to fill this intellectual void – so eloquently expressed in the Sun – was so ingenious. I was at first a sceptic about this constitutional innovation in the democratic process, taking the rather elitist view that that was what ministers were for.  That is why I felt compelled to try to help. It is important that your invitation reaches the widest audience. You will not want to rely on a few cranks, or on a regurgitated splurge from Nigel Farage. You will want to protect your career from any such association.  So how can we help you to find out what people are really thinking and saying, and thus enable you to reverse the present polls, which reveal that a significant majority of people now think that Brexit is going badly?  A key target for your message must be the small entrepreneurs and the larger British companies, which you must show how to exploit the new commercial opportunities. You must not be put off by that cruel cartoon in the Financial Times that showed a microscope on your new desk through which you could find out what these are.  I am president of the European Movement, and as our contribution, we are going to provide you with a website that will collect the latest news and allow people to register their advice as you have requested. It is possible that you will not like everything they say, but that is an opportunity for you to use your formidable debating skills to rebut them.  You will not be surprised to learn that I was persuaded to make this helpful suggestion by the sort of comments I received in response to my article in the Guardian last month. One told me that Brexit had wrecked his wife’s UK export-to-Europe business.  Then there was the report in the Times of the latest survey by the British Chambers of Commerce into the views of its members. A thousand companies were asked to assess the results of Brexit for them; 320 complained of the disadvantages compared with only 59 who were positive. These are the foot soldiers upon whom you have to rely in your ambition to get this great public debate going. You may have noticed that two of your staunchest supporters, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, did not print the story at all. I suppose we can console ourselves with the thought that the privilege of a free society is the freedom not to publish what you don’t like.  The truth will out. What does it say so far? That the government’s Office for Budget Responsibility has said it expects Brexit to hit the economy twice as hard as the global pandemic.  That the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency says that “since the referendum in 2016, 316 companies have chosen the Netherlands because of Brexit”.  That the president of the National Farmers’ Union, Minette Batters, believes labour shortages related to the end of free movement without adequate replacement schemes led to “40,000 healthy pigs” being “culled and simply thrown away … an utter disgrace and a disaster for the pig industry”.  That the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations says it expects an enormous public relations campaign to portray the deal as a fabulous victory, but that it will inevitably be seen by the fishing industry as a defeat. That the Food and Drink Federation says sales to Europe fell 23.7% in nine months in 2021.  Nothing so reveals the reality of Brexit as the meeting of European leaders in Brussels, in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. Our continent faces a threat as severe as anything since the end of the cold war. I am ashamed that the country that in my lifetime saved European democracy has now absented itself as others determine Europe’s response.  There will, Mr Rees-Mogg, be more councils covering the climate crisis, our environment, international crime, control of the internet. In every case we will be absent. That is what Brexit means.

I’d recently launched a philanthropic foundation to help grassroots charities cope with the aftermath of the financial crisis.  We attracted a lot of support from individuals with genuine motives, but soon we were being approached by professional philanthropy advisers – a recently established money-making trade created by wealth managers and “private offices”. But on this occasion an adviser from a luxury concierge firm told us it had a Russian client willing to give us a huge sum to help us start up.  But there were strings attached. The client and his wife had to be invited to charity events attended by royalty, politicians, celebs and opinion formers. We would have to seek out big-brand arts and culture organisations, high-profile sports such as polo, and several named military charities, taking them on as trustees or board members. And they would have to have a say on the charities we funded, including charities in Belarus and Romania.  These demands rang alarm bells. The adviser boasted that he had helped this family to set up a charitable trust and other lucrative services that were earning his firm fat fees.  Even back then, questions were raised about the ability to move large sums of money out of Russia without permission from Vladimir Putin. There was a lot of good we could have done with such a vast sum, but it would have compromised all my principles.  The Conservative party and some of its MPs – Boris Johnson and David Cameron among them – have, of course, been less choosy. This is what makes it very difficult for the prime minister to talk with any credibility about making life tough for rich Russians: he has defended donations made to his party by close Putin associates. On this issue, he is only now keen to talk the talk – but he still won’t walk the walk: there are no timelines or details about enacting laws to clean up “Londongrad”, or indeed dirty money flowing in from numerous dubious sources around the world.  It is generally assumed that Russians often pump their roubles into our society because they crave social respectability. On the contrary, it has long been part of a systematic attempt to destabilise our institutions, most notably our parliament, press and democracy.  Johnson and consecutive Conservative governments have been well aware that the lack of transparency over this cash was a scandal waiting to be exposed. But they have been willing to turn a blind eye for as long as they could benefit.  The ecosystem of enablers includes wealth managers, banks, private equity houses, accountants, lawyers – and the growing army of philanthropy advisers, lobbyists, and thinktanks – who have been complicit in the infiltration by those close to Putin of not just our political infrastructure, but our property market, businesses, charities, public bodies, arts, culture, and sports.  I have crossed paths with many of these during my time vocally campaigning against dodgy practices in the City, and remember that many of us were shocked that in 2018, the British government allowed Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with links to companies that produce Russian military equipment, to raise an estimated £1bn on the London stock exchange.  US security services concluded that examples like this impacted on the government’s ability to tackle important national security issues.  Nor should we ignore the impact of Russian money on the Brexit campaign. In a 2017 Guardian article, I wrote:  “Think of Brexit as a matryoshka, or a Russian nesting doll, with voting to leave the EU as the outer doll … Pulling off the outer doll reveals another doll that represents something much more worrying.”  Today, the rot has been exposed, but words are not enough to restore the reputation and integrity of our institutions. What we need is a raft of robust “cleaning-up” laws, including more stringent checks and due diligence before new organisations can register with Companies House or the Charity Commission, greater scrutiny of trustees, and a register of funders of thinktanks. Professional services must use their expertise and insight to protect the stability and security of our country, and the wider western world – they should not be facilitators of the kind of evil we are now seeing in Ukraine.  Johnson’s government is at least now making some attempts to close loopholes that have for too long allowed dark money into London, making it the money laundering capital of the world. It is time for us to remember that there are some things that money must not be allowed to buy – our morals and integrity.

Everywhere there are calls for an end to the war in Ukraine: from politicians to Premier League footballers to hand-painted pleas for peace in people’s front windows. The illegitimacy and brutality of the Russian invasion make it very easy to condemn.  Yet at the same time, some of Britain’s most longstanding peace activists are being attacked and threatened. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has accused the Stop the War coalition, which has opposed conflicts for more than 20 years, of being “at best … naive” and “at worst … showing solidarity with the aggressor”.  Eleven Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement about Ukraine, including veterans such as John McDonnell and recently elected leftwingers such as Zarah Sultana, were told that they could be expelled from their parliamentary party if they did not remove their names. All the MPs complied. From what was until recently quite a loosely managed political party, it was a strikingly aggressive disciplinary action.  The statement in dispute does not seem outrageous. Published before the invasion, it “opposes any war over Ukraine”, calls for “a diplomatic settlement”, and criticises the British government for “aggressive posturing” and Nato for its “eastward expansion”. There is less criticism of Russia than its own, much more violent, expansionism merits; but little sign of the alleged “solidarity with the aggressor”. “We do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes,” the statement says. “The crisis should be settled on a basis which recognises the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination and addresses Russia’s security concerns.”  Such even-handedness may seem horribly inappropriate now. But the interests of both sides may have to be satisfied if this crisis is ever going to end.  That Stop the War’s stance has provoked what its convenor, Lindsey German, described at a rally last weekend as “a serious backlash” – including a death threat against Sultana – suggests that the space in British politics for pacifism, or even for scepticism about military institutions such as Nato, is dramatically shrinking. Only two years ago, Labour was led by a peace campaigner and Nato critic, Jeremy Corbyn. Now his successor hails helping to found Nato as one of Labour’s “great achievements”, on a par with creating the NHS. The vaguely defined “security” that Starmer has been offering voters, without much success, is suddenly coming into focus as a militaristic project.  You may welcome this as Labour getting real again. The party has a tradition of supporting military action against extremists and aggressors, from the second world war to the Falklands, Afghanistan and Iraq. For a party often characterised regardless as unpatriotic, unrealistic and weak, supporting wars and increasing defence spending can be an appealing tactic. Recent research by the British Foreign Policy Group (BFPG) showed British military interventions most strongly supported by older, white, leave-voting men outside London: exactly the voters that Starmer has prioritised winning back.  The more moral left-of-centre case for militarism was summed up in 1942 by George Orwell. “Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist,” he wrote, as it effectively helped the Nazis. The idea that you could live “aloof” from the war was an “illusion”: the war affected everyone’s lives. Sometimes, a lack of perspective undermines pacifism in general. Anti-war activists don’t always acknowledge how common violence is in peacetime – in coercive modern capitalism, for example.  But more often, pacifists are more worldly than their critics claim. At a packed Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday, speakers talked about poverty, inequality and austerity as well as the military situation. Apologists for Russia were conspicuous by their absence. “There is nothing progressive about Putin’s Russia,” said the longstanding anti-war campaigner Tariq Ali, to loud applause. Corbyn accurately described it as a regime of “robber barons”.  The idea that pacifists are dupes or tools of the enemy surfaces in Britain every time there is a war. Despite that, a lot of voters are consistently anti-war. The BFPG found almost a fifth opposed British interventions under any circumstances. They are nearly always under-represented in parliament. Except for rare large rebellions such as those over Iraq and Syria, “unity” is prized during wars. Anyone who believes in democracy ought to be uneasy when they hear that word.  Sometimes pacifists are naive, for example about Hitler in the 1930s. Yet the same criticism could be made of the supposed realists who backed the Afghan and Iraq wars. Often, not fighting is the least bad option, which is why most countries rarely do. British parochialism – and the shaping of opinion by our huge defence industry – stops us seeing how unusually warlike we are.  For now, our politicians are resisting the temptation to directly confront the Russians. But it’s a very bellicose kind of restraint – hence Starmer’s fury at Stop the War, which opposes arming Ukraine. And the desire here for peace feels like it could easily flip over into its opposite. At last Saturday’s demonstration outside Downing Street against the invasion, chants of “Stop the war” were followed by other ones from the most Ukrainian parts of the crowd: “Shelter our sky” – impose a no-fly zone – and “Arm Ukraine”.  With a new cold war or worse starting, the peace movement is going to become both more demonised and more vital. People who loudly refuse to accept that the world is divided into two camps, whatever horrors are being committed by one of them, can seem foolish, disloyal, even lacking in basic morality. But without them, our politics will be left to warmongers and their suppliers.

It was the silliness, more than the vulgar opportunism, that caught the eye.  The tube was actually down because of a row over pensions and staffing levels. Two weeks ago, university lecturers were striking on the same principle, though more recently their actions have also been centred on the whole spectrum of declining pay and conditions – a pension raid is often just the most visible edge of a wider erosion of rights. Building a casuistic case linking union action to a brutal kleptocrat’s war, via a Morning Star subscription, is essentially an attempt to delegitimise unions altogether – and not even a serious attempt: more of a festive sidebar to the more sober main narrative.  The more conventional attacks on strikes in any sector follow the same broad contours: why should they get pensions and pay rises and job security when most people don’t? Why should a tube driver be paid £55,000 a year, or a GP £70,000, when most people earn less than that? Shouldn’t they pipe down if they’re so keen on equality?  The casualisation of the general workforce has intensified this dichotomy between unionised workers, with a proper employment contract that can form the basis of a dispute, and everyone else. Even before Covid, workers had been stratified into the self-employed, with no rights, the so-called limb (b) workers, with variable hours and very few rights, and the ones with full rights.  Post-pandemic, fire-and-rehire tactics have driven down rights and conditions even in jobs where those were a given, with the TUC reporting that nearly one in 10 workers had been told to reapply for their jobs or face the sack, and one in four saying their working terms had been downgraded since the start of lockdown. It’s a particularly harsh environment for the young. The Resolution Foundation found that a full third of 18- to 34-year-olds, if they lost jobs during the pandemic, returned to “atypical” work, essentially meaning zero- or variable-hours contracts.  Thus the anti-industrial action argument is distilled to its purest form: why should they be allowed to strike at all, when you can’t, and if you did, you would be instantly replaced, provided you were on the rota that day and anyone noticed you were striking?  It is astonishing how much speculative discussion has been given to the possibility that Covid (plus Brexit effects) might put an inflationary pressure on wages – to the extent that Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, would enjoin good citizens not to ask for more money in these turbulent times – when the evidence was already there that pay and conditions for a significant block of employees had in fact been driven down.  Nonetheless, these arguments have traction: not only because solidarity is complicated in an era of insecurity and fragmentation, but also because industrial action was devised for industries. The original equation between capital and labour was very clear: the withdrawal of the second directly affected the accretion of the first. A modern strike, in a service economy, principally affects customers. Strikes have more collateral damage; they hits commuters, students, people working in hospitality, it creates millions of dissipated inconveniences and hardships rather than one big hit, not least for the strikers themselves. (Though this has always been true, I was amazed to have to explain to my teenagers, who are daft but not stupid, that striking workers don’t get paid, and the tube drivers were inflicting the most pain upon themselves, in defence of a principle and their present and future colleagues.) In an age where jobs with rights and the potential for strike action are concentrating in the public sector, the effects are mainly felt by citizens, rather than employers, to the extent that the collateral becomes the whole of the damage.  None of this is an argument against strikes. Particularly in view of the shameless anti-protest measures in the police and crime bill, it has never been more important to find new ways to exert collective power, and create strategies and allegiances. Sectors should be collaborating so that non-essential workers can strike on behalf of essential workers. Employees within organisations and movements could experiment with relay-strikes, so that the best paid jump first, and are hopefully disruptive enough that the worst paid never have to.  The wildcat strikes of recent history carry vital lessons on what you can withdraw besides labour. In the early 80s, the strike of chemists’ shop assistants in Bradford and elsewhere in West Yorkshire involved the staff protesting by giving out free prescriptions. The strike of the bureaucrats in unemployment benefits offices, also in the 80s, targeted the system not the claimants. School strikes have shown that you don’t need economic heft to make an impact. The combined climate and living wage strikes of 2019 dispensed with the idea of fighting one thing at a time.  What would have been the best way to show solidarity with the tube drivers this week? Not merely saying, “I don’t think they are, in fact, Putin apologists”; nor broadly defending their right to fight for the conditions they signed up to. But maybe to start exploring what industrial action looks like in a post-industrial age. It doesn’t have to look the same, only smaller.

Many seem to forget that in the six years before Roman Abramovich bought the club Chelsea won two FA Cups, a League Cup and the European Cup Winners’ Cup so were hardly the mess some portray. What he did do was quickly take Chelsea to the rarefied next step, allowing world-class managers (such as José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Antonio Conte) and players to join, ushering in a trophy-laden two decades any new owner will find it very hard to replicate. He became a very effective disruptor, upsetting the cosy world at the top of English and European football, and was clearly resented because of this.  Two Champions Leagues. Two Europa Leagues. Five Premier League titles. Myriad domestic cups. So many memories for me. Watching us win the league at Bolton and West Bromwich. Being in Munich, Amsterdam, Baku and Porto to see European trophies being lifted. Watching world-class overseas signings such as Arjen Robben, Claude Makelele, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, Eden Hazard and Thiago Silva wear a Chelsea shirt. A quality of player and a selection of trophies and memories unthinkable to those of us watching the side in the Division Two dog days of 1979-83.  Watching world-class overseas signings such as Didier Drogba and Arjen Robben, here celebrating a goal in 2005, has been a treat for Chelsea fans. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian  The unsentimental and ruthless firing of managers was sometimes uncomfortable for many supporters but it is hard to argue, in retrospect, that those decisions were not justified, with the possible exception of Ancelotti. The sacking of Frank Lampard was decried by many but the appointment of Thomas Tuchel was a masterstroke, leading to Champions League glory months later.  Abramovich was very much in the background, very rarely giving interviews and content to let his executives run the club on a day-to-day basis, though clearly he intervened on the major strategic issues. Those who thought he would get bored, or would use the club as a public plaything, were proved wrong. My view is that he genuinely loves the club but that he has done the right thing, and indeed the only plausible course of action given current circumstances, by signalling his clear intention to sell. I have no idea whether he has close links to the Putin regime – he says he does not – but his statement, his gesture in writing off the massive loans to the club and the commitment to using proceeds of the sale “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”, to me send a pretty strong message.  His legacy, apart from the wonderful memories, includes two world-class managers (Tuchel and Emma Hayes), a bunch of world-class players in the men’s and women’s teams and a superbly run academy producing high-quality stars of the future on a regular basis. My reading is that the vast majority of supporters appreciate all he has done for the club and are hugely grateful for the 19 years of unparalleled (in Chelsea terms) success.  In terms of the future there has to be some trepidation among supporters. The thought of owners taking over and piling debt on to the club in the style of the Glazers or Hicks and Gillette is not a happy one. Will a new regime want Tuchel? Will he want to hang around? Creating a fully functioning new club hierarchy, potentially from scratch, will be far from easy, as other clubs have found.  The club tried, and spectacularly failed, to buy back Chelsea Pitch Owners shares in 2011 and, if a new owner tries again, then they can look forward to another battle with supporters. Shelved plans to build a 60,000 super-stadium may presumably be revived but, given that would require moving away from Stamford Bridge for three to four years during construction, that would inevitably be a fraught process.

The enormous goodwill Abramovich has built up with the Chelsea supporter base since 2003 will need to be earned by new owners, and that will certainly not be as easy as the Amanda Staveley brigade found it at Newcastle. Abramovich’s investment turned Chelsea into a genuinely world-class club, as evidenced by the recent World Club Cup success. Whoever takes over will have a really tough job to consolidate and build on that.  Tim Rolls first watched Chelsea in 1967 and is a contributor to cfcuk fanzine.

The Polish Football Association, which has led opposition to continued Russian involvement in international competition since the outbreak of war, has written to Fifa making the suggestion, with hundreds of foreign players playing their club football in Russia.  The Ukrainian defender Yaroslav Rakitskyi has left Zenit Saint Petersburg and more players are expected to follow at other clubs, with Poland’s Grzegorz Krychowiak hoping to be allowed to leave Krasnodar. This week too the manager of Lokomotiv Moscow, Markus Gisdol, left his role, as did Daniel Farke, the former Norwich City manager who had recently joined Krasnodar. Both managers expressed concerns over working in Russia during the invasion.  The imposition of global sanctions has seen a collapse in the value of the rouble, meaning that some clubs are struggling to pay players’ wages, with contracts commonly agreed in euros. Some high-profile players may see their contracts cancelled, but a plan to reopen the window would see all contracted players given the opportunity to negotiate deals elsewhere.  Fifa were approached by the Guardian for comment.  European football bodies have this week been concentrating on trying to help players in the Ukrainian league reach safety, one small part of the growing migrant crisis caused by the war. On Thursday the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, said the war was the “most terrible situation” and that the “madness” of the conflict must stop.  “I was on the phone for 48 hours with clubs and coaches to get them out of the Ukraine,” Ceferin told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. “It’s hard for me to explain how sad those conversations were. One of the players who left Ukraine came to my home, another came today. They told me about their children and about the bombs exploding outside their home. I am proud of the football family that we stood together to do our part. The football part. It’s really hard to say what will happen tomorrow but this war should stop, this madness should stop.”  Ceferin said it was “impossible” to say under what circumstances the ban on Russian football might be reversed. “For now it stays and we are waiting for peace to come,” he said. “Football will probably be the least important thing.”  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

Uefa has moved the Champions League final from Russia and cancelled its longstanding sponsorship deal with Gazprom. It has previously sought to steer clear of making decisions that could be seen as political, including during the men’s European Championship last summer when it refused a request to illuminate Munich’s Allianz Arena in the colours of the rainbow flag.  Also speaking at the Football Summit, the general secretary of the players’ union Fifpro, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said the current crisis meant that football could no longer claim to sit outside of politics.  “I think sport has to accept that the idea you make an institution apolitical is just a myth,” Hoffman said. “Because what people do with it makes it political. If Putin decides it’s not apolitical it’s not. Football should stand for values of peace freedom sovereignty, human rights but also equality. The rainbow flag is a political decision.”

The 2022 running of the event, set for 25 September at the Olympic Park in Sochi, had already been cancelled last week after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. F1 announced only in June that an agreement had been reached to move the Russian round to Igora Drive, 40 miles north of St Petersburg, from 2023. But now the sport has moved to scrap the race altogether.  A statement read: “Formula One can confirm it has terminated its contract with the Russian Grand Prix promoter, meaning Russia will not have a race in the future.”  On Thursday Motorsport UK announced that Russian-licensed drivers have been banned from competing in the UK. It means the Haas driver Nikita Mazepin, the sole Russian on the F1 grid, will not be able to take part in July’s British Grand Prix.  Mazepin’s immediate future in F1 hangs in the balance. His father, the oligarch Dmitry Mazepin, is a part-owner of Haas’s title sponsor, Uralkali. Haas removed the branding of the Russian fertiliser company for the final day of testing in Barcelona last week. F1’s governing body, the FIA, will still allow Russian drivers to compete, albeit under a neutral flag.  Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

The Russian round was added to the calendar in 2014 after Bernie Ecclestone struck a lucrative deal with Vladimir Putin. Ecclestone, 91, in an interview this week backed the FIA’s stance on Russian drivers. “It was absolutely the right decision by the FIA,” said Ecclestone, who ran F1 for four decades.  “There are so many things being agreed by the world about this conflict between Russian and Ukraine. But I don’t think anybody has really thought it through, or got their heads around it. If there is a Russian driver in F1, what does it have to do with Russia fighting a war? There is no relationship there. The Russian athletes have nothing to do with this conflict. They are not part of it, and they have never been part of it. They just happen to be Russian.”

On an early-February evening in San Francisco, Stephen Curry threads into the heart of the Sacramento defense, spins in place, then whips a one-handed pass the length of the baseline through a tangle of turned heads. By the time it reaches Klay Thompson, the crowd builds to a murmur. A rhythm dribble, a three from the corner, a little blood-pumping bounce on his surgically restored left leg. The shot drops and the noise roars forth: same as it ever was.  At first glance, the Golden State Warriors are telling a straightforward story this season: the club that rewired the NBA is back. After Curry and co ripped off three championships in four years from 2015 to 2018, their good fortune soured as quickly. In the 2019 finals, Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles tendon and Thompson tore his ACL; Durant left the club in free agency that summer. In the fourth game of the next season, Curry landed hard on his hand – not the record-setting right, small miracles – and missed nearly the entire year with broken bones and nerve damage. After spending a year rebuilding his knee, Thompson tore his own Achilles in November 2020: another full season lost. Now the team is mostly whole (Draymond Green, Golden State’s canniest passer and firiest defender, has started practicing again as he heals from a back injury, and Thompson has missed the last couple games with illness) and perched near its accustomed spot, second in the Western Conference with a 43-19 record.  Perhaps owing to everything that’s happened outside of arenas in the interim, even those fans who groused over the Warriors’ dominance last decade have largely welcomed its return. The team scans as metaphor, the comeback beats dovetailing nicely with its hopeful, cooperative vision of the sport: Basketball for a Better Day. “I got goosebumps on the other side of the court just watching. Big smiles and all that,” Curry said after Thompson took the court again in January, and a chorus of players and fans online said the same. But that reading, of After rewinding to Before, obscures a more meaningful one. This is a team still struggling through, in key ways, still chasing what it once had. They’re showing you don’t have to get it all back to make it worthwhile.  Slip some truth serum into the Gatorade bottles of Golden State’s Big Three, and they’d all tell you they prefer their former selves. Thompson has been solid, chipping in three triples a game, but he’s not yet the form-shooting android who once registered 37 points in a single quarter. At 31 years old, Green has reached the juncture where his cast-iron heft is as much a burden to be managed as an asset to be deployed. And Curry, the most prolific long-range marksman of all time, is suffering the first stretch in recent memory that might be called a slump. During the month of January, he shot 38.5% from the field; over 11 seasons of his career, he has done better than that from three. “Steph is human, I think people forget because he seemed inhuman for so long,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said near the end of that month. “Shots just aren’t falling.”  Still, the Warriors’ stock of individual talent has only ever been part of the team’s story, and as the big names have scuffled or missed time, the system has picked up the slack. “I’m a little more egalitarian in my approach,” Kerr told Insider in 2018, explaining his preference for an everybody-eats ethos over the feed-the-star sets favored leaguewide. “Maybe because I was a role player myself, I feel there’s a power in everybody touching the ball and everybody sharing in the offense.” When they’re humming, the Warriors seem controlled by a chess hustler working a speed game against an outmatched tourist. Defenders wall off fakes and feints in the far reaches, and all of a 19-year-old rookie is sailing to the rim on an open file.  Kerr’s MO has obvious game-by-game benefits: even weathering a chilly Curry, the Warriors score seven more points per 100 possessions than their opponents, the third-most efficient mark in the NBA. But its real value is as a long-term investment. Golden State has made a custom of turning unwanted players – low draft picks, well-pedigreed disappointments – into reliable and enthusiastic contributors. The team drafted Jordan Poole with the 28th selection in 2019, the kind of pick often thrown in as who-cares trade fodder; holding down a starting role until Thompson’s return, he averaged 17 and a half points a game. Gary Payton II was nearly out of the league before the Warriors took a flier on the point guard in October; he has become one of the league’s most bothersome defenders, capable of ripping a ballhandler on one possession and snuffing the shot of an MVP center the next.  The most successful of the reclamation projects has been Andrew Wiggins, a onetime top overall pick who, over six seasons in Minnesota, stayed stuck in a state of potential. He had long arms and a born scorer’s springy athleticism, but at one point in 2019 devolved to one of the worst shooters in the league, and the Timberwolves sent him to Golden State midway through last season. Afforded space by Curry and trust from Kerr, Wiggins has morphed into what he was long projected to be, a glyph of rim-rattling, shot-blocking, jumper-canning bounciness. He’s set career marks across the board this year – including, to be sure, in smiles – and in January was named to his first All-Star team. Kerr called the announcement “one of the proudest moments I’ve had as a coach.”  To be appreciated beyond their own city, great teams have to thread a needle. They need to be excellent but relatable, to win without that winning seeming like a simple unspooling of superior talent. At their peak, the Warriors failed at this (and this alone). A fluke of the salary cap had let them sign Durant in 2016 and slot the four-time scoring champion next to the best shooting tandem in history. They went out and collected championships until they got too hurt to do so.  Now? Now, the Warriors are thrillingly, lovably fallible. (Durant would’ve been a sure firewall against the 19-point comeback they surrendered to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday evening.) In a mid-February game against the Lakers, they trailed late; a loss would have been their third straight. Curry had missed six of seven three-point tries, and without Green, Golden State couldn’t do much to slow LeBron James. But Klay Thompson caught some of the old fire, tracking to open spots and shooting as soon as the ball touched his hands – 16 fourth-quarter points in all and three triples in the last four minutes. With 45 seconds left and the Warriors protecting a one-point lead, Curry dribbled out near the midcourt logo. In years past, this would have been time for the calling card: a stepback three, a shimmy started before ball touched net.  Instead, Curry hesitated and then opted for plan B, slipping into the lane and scooping a steep layup over the arms of the back-line defenders. The shot hung on the rim before dropping, and while it did so Curry stood on the baseline with his head tipped back, watching the ball. He wasn’t celebrating but hoping for a good end to a tough night. Who can’t understand that?

He tells Michael Safi how his life changed forever after last week’s Russian invasion  As Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border, 22-year-old Volodymyr Ksienich decided to leave his job working for an NGO in Warsaw to return to his Ukrainian homeland in its hour of crisis.  He describes to Michael Safi how he and his father joined a territorial support unit in Kyiv where he has been learning to operate an automatic rifle, spending nights in the woods preparing to repel a Russian attack.  He says he has no ill will towards ordinary Russians but that he will not shirk from his duty if he is forced to defend himself. And he is calling on Europe to maintain the pressure on Vladimir Putin.

The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion.  They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership.  In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed.  Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend.  Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border.  It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000.  For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack  Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far?  Putin: pursuing an old Soviet glory? Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Vladimir Putin  The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded.  A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema.  Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy.  Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia.  More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep.  Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas.  At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word.  Joe Biden: a message to China as well as to Russia. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  Joe Biden  The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster.  Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state.  Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan.  Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move.  Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere.  Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution.  Zelenskiy: under pressure to go slowly on Nato membership. Photograph: Reuters  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine’s president impressed world leaders in the Munich security conference this weekend with a brave and punchy speech after ignoring warnings to stay at home for fear of a Russian-inspired coup attempt. His response to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put.  One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides.  Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s.  True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force.  Scholz and Macron: soft line and hard line? Photograph: Getty Images  Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz  Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises.  These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war.  Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front.  While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions.  Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights.  That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach.  The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far.  Johnson (right, with Zelenskiy): errand boy for America? Photograph: Getty Images  Boris Johnson  Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it.  At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally.  The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid.  But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff.  Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London.  All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America.  When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.

Permit prices, which are part of the EU’s emissions trading scheme, were launched in 2005, and reached a high of €97 (£80) in early February, but have now slumped below €70. Prices were on course to drop to almost €60 on Wednesday afternoon, representing the biggest fall since 2014.  The carbon price is the EU’s flagship financial mechanism for curbing emissions, with companies, such as airlines, forced to buy the permits when they pollute.  But investors appear to be pulling out of the market, with some experts saying they have been “spooked” by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The carbon price usually moves with energy prices but it has decoupled because of Vladimir Putin’s war.  Ingvild Sorhus, a lead analyst for EU Carbon Analysis, said: “The escalating Ukraine crisis continued to spook investors’ sentiment and led to widespread liquidation of EUA positions.  “Carbon prices are currently decoupling from the rest of energy complex, which rose on Russian supply concerns. Some participants perhaps suffered huge losses due to the spike in energy prices and were forced to sell EUA to avoid margin calls.  “They are perhaps fretted [sic] about the impact of sanctions against Russia and also the economic fallout on the EU. Hence international investors maybe choose to offload their exposure to European assets.”  She added that sharply rising commodities prices “could have hurt some industrial producers’ cashflows who then also sold off their surplus EUAs”, with the steep fall triggering more stop-losses and automatic selling.  After the Cop26 climate summit last year, the EU carbon price surged to record levels and continued to do so in January as inflation and energy prices rose.  The carbon price is an important EU policy aimed at curbing emissions across Europe’s entire energy and industrial sector. In theory, the more companies pay, the more effort they will put into cutting emissions.  Meanwhile, Alessandro Vitelli, a freelance journalist specialising in climate and energy, said traders might have sold their permits to raise funds for natural gas positions. He also speculated Russian investors could be pulling their money out to avoid sanctions.  “There has been a general liquidation of positions by investors over the last couple of trading sessions,” he said.  “Some of this is due to commodity funds looking to release cash to move into other assets, but there is also some speculation that Russian investors are pulling their money out of funds to avoid sanctions that would freeze assets.  “The sharp rise in European natural gas prices – 38% today, after a 23% rise yesterday – also means that traders will need to post additional collateral to maintain futures positions.  “They may well have sold carbon permits in order to raise cash to support those natural gas positions.”  Other countries and trading blocs have carbon markets but set their own rules. For example, China has the largest but has lower prices and more relaxed rules.

Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine.  The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague.  It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula.  Quick Guide Three ways you can help the people of Ukraine from the UK Show Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

Thank you for your feedback.  Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine.  The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”.  “Individuals have rights to have their interests vindicated and for justice to prevail,” Khan said.  “That can only take place if evidence is independently and impartially collected and assessed and then in due course, decisions can be made regarding whether or not there’s criminal responsibility, and then the judges ultimately will decide.”  Asked about reports Russia was using cluster bombs in civilian areas, Khan said “it is clear … directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects amounts to a war crime”.  The ICC investigation will look back as far as 21 November 2013, when Ukraine’s then president rejected closer integration with the EU, leading to huge protests that precipitated Russia’s annexation of Crimea.  Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “targeting civilians indiscriminately” and directing troops to tear through towns across Ukraine. “The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done,” she said.  The UK justice secretary, Dominic Raab, told the Daily Telegraph Britain could house Russian commanders suspected of war crimes in its prisons – and act as a safe haven for witnesses who testified against them. He said that “few countries around the world” had the UK’s “lead information”, which would likely prove “absolutely critical” to the ICC.  As the Russian invasion entered its eighth day, the UN refugee agency estimated that 1 million people had now fled Ukraine, making it the swiftest exodus of refugees this century.  More than 2,000 civilians had died since the invasion began, Ukraine’s state emergency service said.  00:43 Ukraine president says defences are holding against Russian invasion – video  Moscow’s international isolation was further displayed when the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand Putin immediately withdraw Russian troops: 141 nations backed the motion and only five, including the alleged co-aggressor Belarus, opposed it.  The UK government has been criticised for the pace of sanctions being levelled on Russians close to Putin and their business interests. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, questioned on Wednesday why it would take 18 months for a new register of property ownership to apply to existing owners.  Frans Timmermans, first vice-president of the European Commission, said he thought the UK was “following our lead”.  After it was revealed the Conservatives had accepted an £80,000 donation from the former wife of one of Putin’s ministers within the last six months, Timmermans added: “I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want”  Damian Hinds, the UK security minister, told LBC radio: “I don’t accept that my political party accepts money from illegitimate sources.”  Hinds also welcomed the ICC investigation and said all indications suggested that Putin “is guilty” of war crimes.  UK officials have said more sanctions are coming, against oligarchs, Russian national security council members and banks, and that they believe the economic shock of the moves has been more significant than Putin was expecting.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors.  In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”.  However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”.  Video footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official showed crowds of Ukrainians forming a barrier between the Russian forces and the nuclear plant, blocking their advance.  The interior ministry official, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.”  Ukraine has asked the IAEA to declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants.  Grossi told the IAEA board of governors meeting in Vienna: “It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhihia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them.”  The IAEA also said that a feed of radiation data from Zaporizhzhia had been interrupted on Tuesday and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate (SNRIU) was trying to find out the reason for the break and to restore the flow of data.  Grossi also raised concern over a report from the SNRIU that since Russians took over the Chernobyl plant, site of the 1986 disaster in north western Ukraine near the Belarus border, the staff there had not been permitted to go home.  The US deputy envoy to the IAEA, Louis Bono, said: “The Ukrainian staff at the site have not been allowed to leave and have been forced to work multiple shifts. This added stress on staff performing critical tasks further jeopardizes the safety and security of the site and the public.”  In his remarks Grossi said: “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at [the Chernobyl plant] are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,”  The remains of the reactor core which exploded in 1986 is buried under concrete at the site, and there are also spent fuel storage facilities and a large amount of radioactive dust in the topsoil of the surrounding area.  The churning up of the soil by Russian military vehicles caused limited radiation spikes. In a statement, Energoatom said: “Being in the exclusion zone now and apparently not having the skills to ensure personal safety when working in radioactively contaminated areas, the invaders are exposed to significant external and internal radiation, which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the form of cancer.”  On Sunday, the Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had struck the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. The day before, an electrical transformer in another waste facility in Kharkiv was damaged. In both cases there was no radioactive release, but the incidents highlighted the potential threat of ecological disaster from a war underway in a country with an extensive nuclear industry.  The American Nuclear Society (ANS), an association of industry professionals, is seeking to send material support to Ukraine to help nuclear workers there.  “The staff at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption undue pressure or the fear of being killed or injured,” the ANS said in a statement. “Ukraine’s nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes and a peace of mind that their loved ones are safe.  The society’s president, Steven Nesbit, said he hoped that the Russian invaders were aware of the dangers of a nuclear accident.  “All I can say is it’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have a sensitivity to the issues here,” Nesbit said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin need to be taking all steps they can to avoid becoming even more of a pariah nation than they have become.”

Contrary to the prime minister’s claims to be leading the world in the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine, there is frustration among allies over the UK’s lethargy in hitting Russian wealth.  The government is being urged in behind-the-scenes discussions with the EU to target more named individuals believed to be sheltering their wealth in London property and financial structures.  That private frustration was made public in comments from Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president on Thursday. “I don’t hesitate to say this,” Timmermans told the BBC. “The UK is now following our lead. And I’m sure they will continue to follow the lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this.  “And I think now even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they, you know, they need to change course, because that’s what – if I don’t misunderstand the public mood in the UK – that’s what the British public want.”  The Foreign Office has for days been promising to publish a schedule of oligarchs it will hit, but as yet just eight such individuals with links to Vladimir Putin have been listed.  A government official told the Times on Thursday that it would take “weeks and months” to enforce sanctions on the same level as the EU due to a lack of legal and investigative capacity.  Meanwhile, among the 680 individuals subject to EU asset freezes and travel bans, are tens of named oligarchs or Putin allies, including Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, who sits on the Russian security council.  Asked about the discrepancy between the UK and EU record on imposing sanctions on individuals around Putin, the Home Office minister Damian Hinds told the BBC that “it was not a competition”.  On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, questioned why Shuvalov, who owns two luxury flats in Whitehall Court, and others like him, were not yet being targeted by the British government.  The owner of Chelsea football club, Roman Abramovich, who Starmer said had been accused in a leaked Home Office document of having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”, is also not yet subject to UK restrictive measures.  01:15 Keir Starmer asks why Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has not been hit by sanctions – video  Abramovich has announced that he is selling the London club.  EU officials confirmed that they were concerned by the flight of assets out of the UK, which has long been a favourite location for shielding the wealth of Russian oligarchs linked to the Putin regime.  “On the question of oligarchs, I think we believe seizing and freezing assets [is] really important and we believe one of the most effective tools,” an EU official said. “Of course, we are encouraging partners to do the same and to move as quickly as possible.” The official added: “Speed is of the essence, because if you announce sanctions and then you take a week to take [action], then the assets are somewhere else. So that’s important.”  A series of high-profile examples of action within the EU against figures close to Putin has highlighted the discrepancy.  On Thursday, the French authorities announced they had taken a €108m yacht owned by Igor Sechin, chief executive of the large Russian energy firm Rosneft.  Donors who have made money from Russia or have alleged links to the Putin regime have given £1.93m to either the Conservative party or individual Conservative associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019, according to analysis by Labour.  Sources said the EU was now preparing to target the family members of oligarchs to ensure that they cannot avoid the impact of sanctions.  An EU official said: “We have made a legal change in the legal basis of our sanctions regime to allow us to target the family members of oligarchs which up until now has not been possible.”  The official said that a joint unit with other Western allies was also being established to examine loopholes.  “We are forming together with the United States, Canada and also the UK a kind of task force that is now beginning to drill down into detail as to potential ways to bypass the sanctions and the listings and also to unravel if you like the role of trust companies and holding assets, and also in holding property,” the official said.  “This will provide, I think, an information base that will be incredibly useful both in terms of looking at further listings, and extending listings to close loopholes as they become apparent that is operational and working.”

The legislation, which is to be put before parliament in the coming days, will prevent UK-based insurance or reinsurance firms from offering contracts linked to Russia, whose businesses and oligarchs are already facing a raft of UK, US and EU sanctions.  The rules could come into force as early as next week and are intended to “severely limit” the industries’ access to global markets, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tweeted on Thursday, as Russian forces continued to attack cities across Ukraine.  “Coupled with similar actions by the EU, this move further isolates Russia’s economy from the international financial system,” the Treasury added. Neither the Lloyd’s of London insurance market nor the Treasury were able to immediately confirm the value of soon-to be blocked insurance contracts.  It was also unclear whether the rules would require insurers to cancel existing contracts or just block new transactions.  Russian companies in the aviation or space industry will now be prevented from making use of UK-based insurance or reinsurance services directly or indirectly.    This measure will severely limit their access to the global insurance and reinsurance market. — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) March 3, 2022  The sanctions have so far targeted two industries in which London, and Lloyd’s in particular, are considered global leaders.  The UK is also a leader in the maritime insurance industry, but British sanctions have largely avoided targeting industries such as shipping.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The EU has also avoided such sanctions, which could affect energy supplies, given the bloc’s reliance on Russian oil and gas.  However, it is understood that the Treasury is considering expanding the sanctions to ban other Russia-linked industries.  Patrick Tiernan, the chief of markets at Lloyd’s, said: “We are in regular communications with the UK government and international regulators and are working closely with the Lloyd’s market to uphold the implementation, at pace, of sanctions applied by governments around the world. We continue to monitor the unfolding situation in Ukraine and our thoughts are first and foremost with those people directly affected.”

The LSE said it was moving to block trading in the companies that include Severstal, Russia’s largest steel and mining company run by Alexei Mordashov, the country’s richest man and the largest shareholder in Tui, Europe’s biggest tour operator.  Also barred are the aluminium company EN+, whose owners include the oligarch Oleg Deripaska, state-controlled Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, Rosneft and VK, the parent company of social networking sites including VKontakte, which is bigger than Facebook in Russia.  The list also includes the fertiliser company PhosAgro, which is chaired by former LSE chief Xavier Rolet and has shareholders including the billionaire Andrei Guriev, who owns Witanhurst in London’s Highgate, the largest private house in the capital and second in size only to Buckingham Palace.  Also barred are the energy firm Lukoil, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, which is controlled by the family of Suleiman Kerimov, as well as Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, and Novolipetsk Steel, one of the four largest steel companies in Russia.  The companies trade financial instruments in London including global depositary receipts (GDR) and American depositary receipts (ADR), but not ordinary shares, which are traded in the market where they have their primary listing.  The LSE said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”.  However, David Schwimmer, the chief executive of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), said that seven Russian companies trading in GDRs had not been suspended as this depended on further sanctions or an inability to maintain an orderly market in them.  These are the state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit and the investment company Sistema.  “The level of sanctions is unprecedented and very dynamic,” Schwimmer said, speaking on a media call as LSEG announced its financial results for 2021.  Companies that are incorporated in the UK with a primary listing in London – or those incorporated elsewhere that adhere to the UK corporate governance and takeover codes and have more than 50% of their shares traded freely in the UK capital – are so far not subject to sanctions.  The mining company Evraz, in which Roman Abramovich owns a 29% stake, and the precious metals mining group Polymetal meet LSE criteria for being assigned “UK nationality” for trading purposes. On Wednesday, both companies dropped out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review after their market values have plummeted.  International pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region.  Schwimmer said LSEG had not decided what to do about the 150 staff at its Moscow operation. The company also has nine staff in Ukraine. “Their welfare is our priority and we have taken, and will continue to take, all steps we can to help them stay safe,” he said.  LSEG, which said its own operations in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of total income, added it would “continue to keep this situation under review”.  On Friday, the exchange suspended VTB Capital, a subsidiary of Russia’s second-largest bank VTB, from trading. Earlier this week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspended trading in the bank’s global depository receipts on the LSE, where it has a secondary listing. Its main listing is in Moscow.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br>  On Wednesday, Sberbank announced it was pulling out of the European market, after it said it faced large outflows of cash in the region as well as threats to the safety of its employees and branches.  The announcement came only hours after the European Central Bank ordered the closure of Sberbank Europe, warning the business could fail after a run on deposits because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.  LSE reported an almost doubling of pre-tax profits from £492m in pandemic-hit 2020 to £987m last year. Total income more than tripled year-on-year from £2bn to £6.7bn. The company’s share price rose more than 7% on the positive results.

Keep calm and continue to defend the motherland!” Ukraine’s National Agency for the Protection against Corruption (NAPC) said, according to the Ukraine arm of the Interfax news service.  The agency went on to explain there was “no need to declare the captured Russian tanks and other equipment, because the cost of this ... does not exceed 100 living wages (UAH248,100) ($8,298).”  The rare wry moment comes as fighting intensifies across Ukraine and the conflict enters its eighth day. Cities across Ukraine came under heavy bombardment including the capital Kyiv and the second largest city, Kharkiv, sparking an exodus of more than a million people, according to the head of the United Nations refugee agency.  Ukraine continued to push back against the advance of Russian forces, and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday praised the “heroic” resistance to Moscow’s invasion. Citizens in Ukraine have been seen preparing molotov cocktails and learning how to use arms as civilians join forces to defend their country.  03:50 Moments of defiance: how Ukraine has stood up to Russia – video  In its statement, the NACP said “combat trophies” would not be required to be declared for income tax purposes in part because they were acquired “in connection with the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation” against the “independent and sovereign Ukrainian state”.  “Thanks to the courage and victory of the defenders of the Ukrainian state, enemy military equipment usually comes to you already destroyed and disabled, which makes it impossible to evaluate it in accordance with the law,” it said.  “At the same time, the NACP continues to ensure the technical possibility of providing notifications of significant changes in the property status for the acquisition of objects seized from the Russian army, if there is a desire to declare same,” the statement concluded.

Liz Truss said the UK “was trying to make sure the Russian economy is crippled so that it can no longer be able to fund its war machine”, adding that she hoped the Russian people would draw their conclusions if this happened.  She praised the Russian demonstrators protesting against what she described as Putin’s war of choice, adding: “I do not believe Putin speaks on behalf of the Russian people.”  A group of energy-dependent countries within the EU have successfully argued that that some major Russian banks including Gazprombank and Sberbank should not be kicked out of the Swift international payments system.  If Gazprombank was excluded from Swift gas and oil imports from Russia into Europe would become increasingly difficult, forcing up prices even higher.  02:35 ‘Ukrainians are our friends’: the young Russian anti-war protesters defying Putin – video  But Truss said: “We need to make sure no Russian bank has access to Swift.” She added that the west had two clear objectives: “Vladimir Putin must fail in this horrific enterprise and his ambitions go no further.”  Some Baltic States want a no-fly zone be implemented, but the US and UK oppose this on the grounds it could lead to a direct conflict with Russia.  British troops lead a joint expeditionary force in Estonia that has been strengthened by doubling the number of UK forces in recent weeks as the Russian threat to Nato countries has grown. Truss added that UK intelligence was working more closely with Lithuania to look for any evidence of Russian troop buildups in the Suwalki gap, a narrow strip of land between Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave.  She said the west’s weapons were being used to stop Putin’s tanks, but that more needed to be done. “This is a struggle not just for Ukraine’s freedom and self-determination, but for all of our freedom and security. By continuing to respond with strength we will together ensure that Putin loses.”  She confirmed she would personally attend an EU meeting of foreign ministers on Friday, despite Britain having left the bloc, where she will raise the issue of further sanctions on Belarus. She will attend alongside the Ukraine foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken.  She will also attend a Nato meeting on Friday where foreign ministers are due to have a larger discussion about a change in defence strategy.

Van Taylor, who was bidding for a third term in the US House of Representatives, said: “About a year ago, I made a horrible mistake that has caused deep hurt and pain among those I love most in this world. I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life.”  In September 2020, Tania Joya spoke to the Guardian. She described her early life in London and how in the early 2000s she met and married John Georgelas, a convert to Islam from Plano, Texas, who eventually took her and their children to Syria.  “John played an essential part in establishing the caliphate and was a leading propagandist for Islamic State, helping to groom other westerners,” Joya wrote, adding that after she left Syria, she “found out that he had died, most likely during US bombing in 2017”.  Taylor, a Harvard graduate and former US marine, was elected in the Texas third congressional district in 2018. Joya told the Dallas Morning News she met him through her work with former jihadists.  Joya, who now lives in Plano, north of Dallas, also told the paper Taylor gave her $5,000 as their nine-month affair wound down, and that she eventually told another Republican candidate about her relationship with the congressman.  She said: “All I wanted was for Suzanne Harp to just say, ‘Hey, I know your little scandal with Tania Joya – would you like to resign before we embarrass you?’ But it didn’t happen like that.”  Harp – “the conservative, pro-Trump, America First candidate”, according to her website – orchestrated coverage of the affair on rightwing sites, the Morning News reported.  Then on Monday, the night before the primary, Harp attacked Taylor for behavior she called “shocking … disturbing and unbecoming of a sitting US representative”.  Taylor’s vote fell, leaving him facing a runoff with the second-placed candidate, Keith Self, that he will not now contest.  In an email quoted by the Morning News, Taylor told supporters: “Today I am announcing I will not continue my campaign to seek re-election to Congress.  “I want to apologise for the pain I have caused with my indiscretion, most of all to my wife Anne and our three daughters. For months, Anne and I have been working to repair the scars left by my actions. I am unworthy, but eternally thankful for her love and forgiveness.”

Mordashov, a major shareholder in Tui, had resigned “with immediate effect”, the German group said in a statement on Wednesday.  “The aim of the EU sanctions is to prevent Mr Mordashov from disposing of his shares in Tui” and “from realising any proceeds or profits from his investment”, the company said.  The EU on Monday added Mordashov to its list of individuals to be placed under sanctions due to their close ties with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Those affected have been hit by asset freezes and travel bans.  Mordashov, a metals magnate and one of Russia’s richest men, is the chairman of Severstal, one of Russia’s biggest steel producers. Severstal had stopped deliveries to the EU and will look to redirect them to countries where it does not face sanctions. However, it could be difficult to find buyers of about 3m tonnes of annual production destined for the EU, and it is thought likely that the profit it makes on each tonne of steel will fall.  Several directors of Severstal, including two British nationals, Philip Dayer and Alun Bowen, have resigned since the sanctions announcement, the company said.  Separately on Thursday, the Institute of Directors said it was “no longer tenable” for British people to hold board positions in Russian companies.  Mordashov has also resigned his directorship at Nordgold, a mining company incorporated in London, according to Companies House. Nordgold last year converted to a publicly limited company in preparation for a listing on the London Stock Exchange.  Mordashov had been hoping Nordgold would join fellow Russian-linked metals miner Evraz on the FTSE 100 index, but pulled the initial public offering after gold prices fell. He transferred the stake in Nordgold to his wife on Tuesday, company filings show.  He has been a shareholder in Tui for about 15 years and holds a 34% stake in the group through his company Unifirm Ltd.  Tui lists its shares in Germany and the UK. Any shares held on his behalf by an EU bank would be frozen, meaning neither Mordashov nor his companies would be able to buy or sell shares or receive dividends, although Tui is unable to give out dividends under rules imposed by Germany’s government in exchange for emergency loans during the pandemic.  Mordashov raised his stake in Tui to more than a third for the first time last year after a recapitalisation of the group as it sought to recover from the damage inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. If Tui were required to raise more capital he would be unable to take part.  There is uncertainty over whether Mordashov would be able to exercise voting rights in the company, as that would not involve a direct financial transaction.  TUI on Wednesday sought to distance itself from the measures taken against Mordashov. “The EU sanctions relate to Mr Mordashov as a person, not to Tui AG, in which he is a shareholder. In this respect, these sanctions against the shareholder have no impact on the company in which he holds shares,” it said.  In a statement on Monday, Mordashov said he had “absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension” and did not understand why the EU had imposed sanctions on him.

Moira  Love and war in Zennor, Cornwall  DH Lawrence described Cornwall as the best place he’d been to despite his troubles there. Photograph: John Keates/Alamy  I remember reading about DH Lawrence’s turbulent time in Zennor, Cornwall, when sweeping along the bracing coast on a local bus. Lawrence moved there during the first world war with his German wife Frieda, looking to escape stifling London after having had his book The Rainbow banned and being subject to travel restrictions. But he also found himself harassed by some locals in this rural idyll. He and Frieda would, reportedly, sing songs in German while traversing the lush landscape and may have got involved in a brawl or two in the local pub (The Tinner, still going strong). It all ended in tears, and the police ended up evicting Lawrence from the county, accusing him of spying. Still, he described it as the best place he had been. The cottage that he rented is still there and was owned by author Michael Morpurgo around the time he wrote War Horse.

Stepping through the door on to the planked floor is like walking back to a time of pirates, skullduggery, rum and spittoons, but the literary history doesn’t end with Treasure Island. It is also said that Daniel Defoe met Alexander Selkirk in the Llandoger Trow about 300 years ago and his tale inspired him to write Robinson Crusoe. Any bibliophiles’ dream location.

The barren Château d’If prison, surrounded by glistening seas, the narrow streets of the old town, the diverse feel of the Noailles district and the coming and going of many boats that could take me away to all the places talked about in Dumas’s novel. The heat was lingering too, with warm summer nights that reminded me of when Edmond Dantès visited Mercédès. The city still felt gritty, bustling and as proud as it had in the novel, and despite the years of modernisation, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of Dantès.

Photograph: Aliaksandr Antanovich/Alamy  There are many literary reasons to visit Florence, but for me it is the plaque in Piazza della Signoria marking the place of execution of Girolamo Savonarola. Savonarola’s Bonfire of the Vanities in 1497 and his eventual hanging (which both took place in the square) form the background to George Eliot’s superb Romola.  Jeremy Reynolds  The trail to the Green Corrie, Assynt, Highlands  Assynt is strewn with remote lochans. Photograph: GeoJuice/Alamy  At the Loch of the Green Corrie is a wonderful book by Andrew Greig in which the author seeks to find and fish a remote lochan in Assynt, Scotland, at the bequest of his dying friend, poet Norman MacCaig. A few years ago I too set out to find the Green Lochan. A remote walk from the hamlet of Inchnadamph along a stalkers’ track, crossing numerous ice-cold streams, eventually led to the rocky ridge near Glas Bheinn, and from here, on the edge of the Green Corrie, I peered down into the remote loch, with the Eas a’ Chual Aluinn, Britain’s highest waterfall, in the distance. A truly dramatic and wild landscape, captured by the author and now framed in my mind for ever.  Paul Wilson  Words fly off the pages in Naples  Naples has an ‘energising exciting intensity’ captured in numerous novels. Photograph: ezypix/Getty Images  My recent visit to Naples was inspired, among other reasons, by the writers who have been influenced by the city. Sartre, Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde were classic authors enchanted by the almost operatic quality of life there – from the ancient streets and markets to the sweeping views over the Bay of Naples to Vesuvius. Then there is Penny Green’s See Naples and Die and the more recent televised novels of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet. In every book and every moment I spent in the city there is a heady sense of living every moment with an energising exciting intensity.

Aix and pains, Provence, France  Yves Montand (left) and Gerard Depardieu in Jean de Florette, based on Marcel Pagnol’s novel. Photograph: Cinetext/Films A2/Allstar  I’ve loved Marcel Pagnol’s Jean de Florette ever since school days. It’s a story defined by its sumptuous geography. But a family trip to Provence to quench my thirst for pines and cypresses, the mistral, pastis and boules in a hilltop village didn’t pan out. Not quite. The car got stuck between two village houses, we completely failed to find the quaint centre of Aix despite staying nearby, and initially the best food we found was a kebab on a dimly lit corner. But we finally got some feeling of Jean de Florette as we ate a meal featuring grilled local sausage and pastis as the mistral gusted through the cypresses while watching rugby on a TV. A fan of one of the teams sitting close to us was the image of Yves Montand as César Soubeyran! Location? Avenue Marcel Pagnol of course.  Antony T

Poetry walks take many forms: some places demand epic stanzas; others respond to limericks. You can walk for a few minutes, or weeks. The point is that walking with poetry is great fun. Maybe it’s the rhythm thing: our language must have been invented and honed by miles of walking. In fact, as soon as we were walking long distances and trying to remember routes, poetry probably began to be useful as a navigational mnemonic. Walking does lend itself perfectly to learning lines and recitation, something kids are good at and enjoy. John Cooper Clarke said you learn the lines at 12 and find out what they mean 30 years later (he also said “I hate walking”, but we’ll step over that). If there is a prepared route, fine. Some of these 10 suggestions have that, and others make use of existing footpaths, but they all share a link between landscape and poet.  There are many more poetic walks available (try Simon Armitage’s brilliant Stanza Stones around the Pennine Way), but too few dedicated to female poets. Isn’t it time we had a Stevie Smith Way in north London, or a Barrett Browning Trail around Ledbury? The following collection features walks that are ready to roll, best done with headphones and an audio link to the poems where possible. Spotify has poetry from all these choices, sometimes read by the poets themselves. Other sources can also be found online.  Carol Ann Duffy, Forest of Bowland and Pendle, Lancashire  Lancaster Castle. Photograph: Tara Michelle Evans/Alamy  The best poetry walks match excellent verse, superb scenery and a good footpath, but there is an extra element that helps too: historical resonances. The 400th anniversary of the Pendle witch trials in 1612 was the perfect pretext to devise this 48-mile hike across Lancashire from Sabden via Pendle Hill and the Forest of Bowland to Lancaster. En route, Duffy’s atmospheric poem is inscribed on 10 posts.  Here, heavy storm-clouds, ill-will brewed,  Over fields, fells, farms, blighted woods.  On the wind’s breath, curse of crow and rook.  (from The Lancashire Witches)  Arriving in Lancaster, check out the castle where the witches were tried, then walk the half mile to The Golden Lion pub where the poor unfortunates had their last drop to drink. Finally, head up to Golgotha on Moor Lane where they were hanged.  Walk: 48 miles, check LDWA for details  Eat: cafe food at Sanwitches Cafe in Sabden  Stay: YHA Slaidburn (dorm bed £25, doubles £69 room only) is a good base for the Forest of Bowland sections  John Cooper Clarke, Salford  The Erie basin, Salford Quays.

His voice, grim with good-humoured contempt, has often nailed down Salford. Get the train up to Clifton, north-west of Manchester, then follow the Salford Way long-distance footpath as it niggles its way south along the banks of the River Irwell to Salford Quays. Take a spur up Great Cheetham Street. This land has Cooper Clarke’s cuban heels all over it. He grew up on the corner of Bury New Road. His secondary school was here: “It was quite tough,” he once said. “We had our own coroner.” Take a right and another down Camp Street, the greasy star of the poem Beasley Street (and its gentrification-skewering follow-up Beasley Boulevard). In the cafes of the Quays, take a seat and look up some other local alumni: Lemn Sissay, JB Barrington, Longfella and Mike Garry. Then go in the art gallery and see how Laurence Stephen Lowry painted thousands of John Cooper Clarkes into his pictures.

(from The Strand at Lough Beg)  The great Irish poet of his generation was born near Bellaghy, a few miles from the shores of Lough Beg. With the Seamus Heaney HomePlace centre in the village as a starting point, head down to Poet’s Corner coffee house and turn right past Bellaghy Bawn where there is a statue, The Turfman, inspired by Heaney’s poem Digging. From there it’s a half mile down to Lough Beg where a boardwalk takes you along the shore. In summer, when it’s dry underfoot, you can get out to Church Island, reputedly visited by Saint Patrick on his way down the River Bann and mentioned in Heaney’s poem The Strand at Lough Beg.

Photograph: Gavin Gillespie/Alamy  Few poets pass into the august ranks of those who were banned, but Lawrence does. His collection Pansies was seized by Scotland Yard in 1929 and had to be privately printed after being smuggled into Britain. Arguably his best poetry is about nature, but not often the British kind: Hummingbird, Kangaroo and Snake are strange bedfellows on a stroll around Eastwood, Lawrence’s home town, but at least you get to wonder, in amazement, how these redbrick lanes spat out such a bright and shiny pip.  The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping  Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;  Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:  They have triumphed again o’er the ages, their screamings proclaim.  (from The Wild Common)  The start of any walk is the DH Lawrence Birthplace Museum in the centre, heading out to the various houses he lived in. A pint in the Sun Inn is a worthy literary objective as the pub appears in both Sons and Lovers and Lady Chatterley’s Lover. A two-mile extension gets you into High Park Wood alongside Moorgreen Reservoir, a walk Lawrence did many times to visit his close friend, Jessie Chambers, who lived at Haggs Farm.  Walk: around town and up to Moorgreen Reservoir would be around six miles; map: OS Explorer 260  Eat and stay: The Sun Inn (doubles from £60 room only) is around the corner from the DH Lawrence Museum  Philip Larkin, Hull  Hull City Hall. Photograph: Paul Richardson/Alamy  Philip Larkin is inextricably associated with the city of Hull, “this dreary dump, East Riding’s dirty rump”. For some, no doubt, the harsh critique remains true, but Hull is much altered since Larkin’s day (he lived there from 1955 until his death in 1985), and is slowly shaking off the legacy of being vandalised, first by the Luftwaffe, then by its own planning department. “I like it because... it’s on the road to nowhere,” said Larkin.  Sexual intercourse began,  In nineteen sixty-three,  (which was rather late for me)  Between the end of the “Chatterley” ban,  And the Beatles’ first LP.  (from Annus Mirabilis)  Start at the poet’s statue in the railway station, then call in at the nearby Royal Station Hotel bar, a favourite haunt. From there, walk east to the City Hall, a memorable element in his poem Broadcast, passing many grand buildings, including Ferens Art Gallery – definitely worth a visit – before heading off into the superb old town with its famous street, Land of Green Ginger, and several fine Larkin-associated pubs. The trail finishes at Cottingham cemetery, where Larkin is buried.  Walk: 3 miles, map: Larkin Trail download available (pdf)  Eat: The White Hart.

Photograph: SFL Travel/Alamy  This Gloucestershire village is best known today for Stinking Bishop cheese, but it was once home to an illustrious clutch of poetic talents. Edward Thomas, Rupert Brooke and Robert Frost all stayed here in the years before the first world war, drawn by the bucolic splendour of the countryside, and the poets Wilfrid Gibson and Lascelles Abercrombie were both local residents. Frost and Thomas often walked together and Thomas’s indecision about which route to take inspired Frost to write The Road Not Taken.  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry I could not travel both  And be one traveler, long I stood  And looked down one as far as I could  To where it bent in the undergrowth  (from The Road Not Taken)  Two eight-mile poetry walks have been devised around the area, one circling north towards the Malvern Hills past Frost’s house, the second east towards the Forest of Dean. The Daffodil Way is also recommended, especially in springtime. Frost encouraged Thomas to concentrate on poetry, not criticism, and it worked. Thomas’s classic burst of nostalgia, Adlestrop, was conceived during a railway journey to Frost’s house in Dymock in June 1914. His evocations of winter are great for long, frosty forays through the woods, “Out in the dark over the snow, The fallow fawns invisible go.”  Walk: Daffodil Way and Poet’s Path I and II are about eight miles; map: OS Landranger 149 and 162  Eat and stay: Beauchamp Arms (in Dymock) is a lovely pub but has no rooms; Three Choirs Vineyard, two miles from Dymock, has lodges and rooms (doubles from £165 room only) in a glorious setting.  John Betjeman, Padstow, Cornwall  Daymer Bay on the River Camel estuary. Photograph: Ian Woolcock/Alamy  Come tourist bods of dear old Slough, have you never pondered how your dreary dive might take a bow, and cash in? But the Berkshire town has no Betjeman trail, perhaps still smarting from one of English literature’s greatest muggings. You have to go to Cornwall for a Betjeman trail, across the River Camel estuary from Padstow, where the poet laureate lived the last decade of his life, having spent boyhood summers here too.  Those moments, tasted once and never done,  Of long surf breaking in the mid-day sun.  A far-off blow-hole booming like a gun.  (from Cornish Cliffs)  Start at Rock (where the Padstow ferry lands) and walk north along the South West Coast Path to Daymer Bay, “sand in the sandwiches, wasps in the tea”, then looping back to St Enodoc Church where Betjeman is buried, surrounded by the golf club links immortalised in poems such as Hon. Sec. and Seaside Golf: “Lark song and sea sounds in the air, And splendour, splendour everywhere.” There is a lot to enjoy along the way, from SSSI sand dunes to bronze age burial mounds and a holy well said to have been visited by Jesus.

Photograph: Digital-Fotofusion Gallery/Alamy  The true apostle of the “Christ came to the West Country” school was impoverished book illustrator William Blake. Artist, engraver, poet, – if it was hard to pin down Blake’s genius in his own time, it’s just as hard to decide which “trail” should be his. London was his uneasy home for most of his life. You could walk from Tate Britain (after viewing his paintings) to St Paul’s along the Thames Path, then cross the Millennium Bridge and head north-east for Bunhill Fields, where he’s buried.  And did those feet in ancient time  Walk upon England’s mountains green:  And was the holy Lamb of God,  On England’s pleasant pastures seen!  (from Jerusalem)  Blake was happier, for a while at least, when he moved to Felpham, near Bognor Regis, on the south coast, taking up residence in a cottage near the Fox inn. There’s a short walk that connects the cottage, Hotham Park and other landmarks. The house where Blake wrote his most celebrated poem, about building paradise in England, is permanently closed, awaiting funds for restoration. We can only hope the great man would appreciate the irony.

Photograph: David Noton Photography/Alamy  Devised by local teacher Margaret Marande, this magnificent epic starts at Hardy’s birthplace in Higher Bockhampton and finishes 217 miles later at Stinsford churchyard where his heart is buried (the rest of him is in Westminster Abbey). The two places are actually only about a mile apart as the crow flies. In between you get the Jurassic coast, Corfe Castle, Lulworth Cove and plenty of fine ridgeways, woodlands and rivers too.  Had I but lived a hundred years ago  I might have gone, as I have gone this year,  By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,  And Time have placed his finger on me there  (from At Lulworth Cove a Century Back)  Better known for his novels, Hardy actually gave up writing anything but poetry over his last three decades and published more than 900 poems in his lifetime. References to the landscape and rural life abound in classics such as Wessex Heights, A Sheep Fair and Afterwards, but it’s Hardy’s bittersweet tone and sceptical outlook that separate him from his contemporaries.

Photograph: Aled Llywelyn/Alamy  Perhaps the greatest walking poet of them all was Welshman William Henry Davies, who spent his early years wandering Britain and the US, usually in a state of abject poverty and latterly in pain – his leg was crushed when jumping a freight train en route to the Klondike. Before the first world war, it was Edward Thomas who did more than anyone to promote this unusual poet, writing about Davies: “In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?” The Autobiography of a Super Tramp (1908) made his name, followed by A Poet’s Pilgrimage (1918), an engaging picaresque stroll around South Wales.  What is this life if, full of care,  We have no time to stand and stare.  No time to stand beneath the boughs  And stare as long as sheep or cows.  (from Leisure)  It would be difficult, if not suicidal, to replicate the same journey now, as Davies used the main roads, but his literary technique wears well: walk all day, reach a town and head for the pub(s), engage locals in conversation and write it down. Better to use the coastal footpath these days: start from Carmarthen and head for Laugharne, stopping if you require in Llansteffan and St Clears. Dylan Thomas didn’t think much of Davies, but they both liked a drink. Finish off at Browns Hotel. Thomas did, plenty of times.  This article was amended on 3 March 2022 because the author of the poem “Celia, Celia” is Adrian Mitchell, not Adrian Henri as an earlier version said.

She was a visionary, a terrible neighbour (she antagonised hers with a succession of snarling great danes and a penchant for nude DIY) and the inventor of the self-cleaning home. Gabe, who died in 2016 at 101, transformed her Oregon bungalow into a “giant dishwasher”, with a system of sprinklers, air dryers and drains, plus self-cleaning sinks, bath and toilet. “Housework is a thankless, unending job,” Gabe said. “Who wants it? Nobody!”  I agree with Gabe – and with Lenin, who condemned housework as “barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery”. My own objections are mainly founded in sloth and a vague desire to stick it to the man, but for others housework can be difficult, or even impossible.  Ahead of her time … Frances Gabe with a model of her self-cleaning home. Photograph: Tony Barnard/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images  “We’ve tied cleanliness to morality for so long that it’s difficult to see that there are reasons people may have a hard time keeping tidy besides being lazy,” says Rachel Hoffman, the author of Unfuck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess. “If someone has mental illness, disabilities, trauma or chronic health issues, the usual suggestions of how to keep a clean home can be completely out of reach.”  Many can’t and plenty more don’t want to clean. But are we any closer to making Gabe’s utopia a reality? If not, can we make the perpetual grind less arduous? I tried to find out.  Dust  Dust is inescapable: after all, it is mainly – or at least partly, depending on whom you ask – skin. “I don’t believe any amount of exfoliating in the shower is going to stop our clothes and bedding also exfoliating us,” says Kate de Selincourt, a writer on sustainability and health in buildings. Some household dust is worse, she notes: it can contain toxic flame retardants from fabric, weedkiller residue from city pavements, microplastics and other delights.  Could your home be less dusty? Possibly. Mechanical ventilation heat recovery (MVHR) might help. Designed as an environmentally friendly method of heating and ventilating homes, MVHR provides fresh air while conserving heat, but it also filters air on entry, stopping some exterior dirt from getting in. “Standard filters – G4 – can filter out larger particles such as insects, fine hair, flying seeds and other airborne debris,” says Chayley Collis of the Green Building Store.  ‘My objections to housework are mainly founded in sloth.’ Photograph: Christopher Owens/The Guardian  Users can choose a finer F7 filter, which also excludes smaller particles, including pollen. MVHR can eliminate some internally generated dust, too, since it is continuously extracting air. “For example, in a bathroom, when we shake a towel, dust is disturbed off the surfaces and often towel lint is released into the air. Some of this will be extracted by the MVHR system,” says Collis, although heavier particles just fall back to the floor.  How effectively an MVHR system – usually quoted at £1,500 to £3,000 for a “normal” home – limits dust depends on how airtight your home is: gaping windows or doors make it far less effective. For a more lo-tech approach, De Selincourt recommends a shoes‑off policy and “plenty of doormats, ideally ones you can hose down”.  Robots  It is 2022. Elon Musk can fly a car to Mars, or something. Can’t I just jab my phone and get a clean house? Almost. Robot vacuum cleaners are a reality – I have had a Roomba since 2006. It is an angry, battered, much‑repaired little warhorse that roars around, banging into things at arbitrary times of the day and night, swallowing cables, being confounded by rug tassels and demanding I deal with its “brush cage”. Despite this, I love it: it vacuums my floor with almost no intervention from me; the dream.  “We knew people wanted a cleaning robot, because they would tell us,” says Colin Angle, the CEO of the US company iRobot, which makes Roomba. “It was: ‘Good to meet you, Colin, when are you going to clean my floor?’ There was no genius required.”  Even so, Roomba was 12 years in the making. It uses technology developed for mine clearance to ensure coverage, and keeps costs (relatively) low with knowhow developed during a failed foray into robot toys. The engineers voted to call their creation the Cybersuck. Angle refused. “I get full credit for a moment of wisdom.”  Although the UK remains resistant (a distribution issue, according to Angle), Roomba is one of the rare appliances to achieve cultural artefact status. It has inspired a melancholy vacuum’s eyeview Twitter account (@selfawareRoomba) and appeared in viral pet videos and sitcoms (Parks and Recreation’s DJ Roomba), while the tale of the one that recently “escaped” from a Cambridge Travelodge moved even a Roomba-sceptic nation. I think it is because they feel oddly … alive? Infuriating or endearing, it is impossible to remain indifferent to your tiny housemate.  Emma with her gang of cleaning gadgets. Photograph: Christopher Owens/The Guardian  “The personification is powerful,” says Angle. “Within two weeks, 90% of people have given their Roomba a name or use Roomba as if it were its name.” (Ours is Noo Noo, after the Teletubbies’ vacuum.) When he took calls for the helpline in the early days, customers would refuse to relinquish their defective robots for exchange, demanding first aid for their family member.  iRobot sends me its latest app‑enabled robot butler, the j7+, to try. It is definitely better at cleaning and more discreet than my whirring anarchist: there is much less bumping into things, thanks to the new algorithms, and you can choose to let it use your phone’s GPS or speak to other smart devices to work out when everyone is out and start cleaning then. It is also needier: after each “mission”, you can give the robot feedback, with options including “It didn’t need my help” and “It respected my home”.  Noo Noo 2, as we call the sleek interloper, also shows me photographs of obstacles it has encountered (socks, shoes, bags), asking whether it should avoid them permanently or if they are temporary (it is always option one here, robot chum). The tech has evolved to recognise and steer clear of cables, earbuds and even – the nightmare scenario – dog poo. “We actually gathered thousands of pictures of dog poop and made physical and digital models of dog poop – all the glory of hi-tech wizardry,” says Angle. “We’re so confident, we actually guarantee against your Roomba hitting dog poop.”  The Roomba uses technology developed for mine clearance and from a foray into robot toys  Has the servile j7+ – quiet, respectful, responsive, learning – lost some of the original Roomba’s wild poetic soul? Maybe. Could I get used to it? Oh yes.  Robots can also mop: iRobot’s Braava uses the same technological bells and whistles as the vacuum, but it is quieter, slinking eerily around, clicking discreetly. My husband sets it up to follow the Roomba and it feels as if a phalanx of household staff are doing our bidding – the closest we will ever come to feeling like tech billionaires.  Our floors are much cleaner, but the Braava is not fuss-free. Unless you use single-use versions (available, but hardly eco-friendly) you need to rinse the mop pad after use. It also sends plaintive messages asking me to fill its tank, but I don’t care about floor cleanliness enough to respond often. If robots could compare notes, this one would be complaining to Noo Noo about the month it spent begging me to charge it daily, while sitting mere inches from its charging point. Let’s hope they can’t.  Domestic robots feel like the future, but they come at a serious price: £899 for the j7+; £699 for the Braava. An entry-level Roomba starts at £269. They don’t have all the answers, either: like Daleks, they are defeated by stairs. I check Angle isn’t working on a stair‑cleaning vacuum. “I’ve made many robots that can climb stairs,” he says. “You just don’t want to pay for it.”  Hair  I receive a heartfelt plea to investigate the hair problem from a household of multiple dogs and long-haired women; I wish I had better news for them. Oxo’s drain protector does come highly recommended if plughole hair is your bugbear, though. Personally, I am with the cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie, who says: “I get quite excited by unblocking it, pulling it up and the whole great big ball coming up. Totally disgusting.” If all cleaning were as grossly satisfying, I might do more.  Elsewhere, there is no magic bullet that does not involve buzzcuts for all, but MacKenzie is a fan of Bissell stick vacuums for hairy situations. “I promise you no hair gets caught in the brush; it’s a miracle.”  I wonder about matching upholstery to your pet’s fur, but Louise Wicksteed of the interior design firm Sims Hilditch doesn’t recommend this. “A Martindale ‘rub count’ [the rating system that assesses fabric durability] of more than 18,000 should stop it from becoming tatty and snagged by your pet’s claws,” she advises. “Get parcel tape, wrap it around your hand and just kind of dab your hand on the sofa,” says MacKenzie. “It’s quite enjoyable.” And you could do it sitting down, I suggest, hopefully. “Kind of, yes.” She doesn’t sound convinced.  Window grime  I hate cleaning windows – I can never eliminate every smear. Can technology help? Outside, yes. Self-cleaning glass exists – and you can install it at home. Pilkington produces Active, a coated glass. “The coating works in two ways,” says its UK marketing manager, Leo Pyrah. “It’s photocatalytic, so it takes UV energy from daylight and the coating reacts to break down and loosen organic dirt.”  The coating is also hydrophilic, which means it stops droplets forming when it rains, so “the water spreads out evenly”. It is 20% more expensive than normal glass and not something you can use indoors – yet. “We have been doing research on using UV lamps to activate the coating,” says Pyrah, but there is no imminent replacement for elbow grease, or, in my case, ignoring grease.  Hiding  If cleaning is too much, can camouflage help? When it comes to hiding dirt, ditch minimalism: pattern is your friend. There is a reason those English country houses full of labradors go heavy on the chintz. The interior designer Irene Gunter of Gunter & Co says that needn’t mean over-the-top florals: you can get a forgiving effect with subtle variations in tone and texture.  Out with the old … Emma with a traditional mop – and a robot version. Photograph: Christopher Owens/The Guardian  She also avoids painted walls – “a real pain in the butt” – as marks on even the most aspirational heritage emulsion are hard to remove cleanly. In heavy-use areas such as kitchens and hallways, she recommends easy-to-maintain, wipeable wood panelling or vinyl wallpapers.  Similarly, less-than-immaculate floors look better with texture. Wood is good, because it has “grain and life”. Avoid tiles that are “like a piece of paper, super flat,” Gunter suggests; pick something with a variety of shades, even of the same colour. “If you’ve got a bit of dust or a raisin lying on the floor, it doesn’t shout out at you.”  Darker isn’t necessarily better, according to Wicksteed: “A common misconception is that a dark floor colour will hide dirt more effectively; this is particularly true when using dark stone to disguise a pet’s muddy pawprints.” But dirt is often lighter-coloured and mud dries paler than people expect. She recommends lighter-coloured limestone, which is more forgiving at hiding “tell-tale signs of animals around the house”.  Match your grouting to your tiles, advises Gunter. If it needs to be pale, persuade your tiler to use harder-wearing epoxy grouting. “I don’t need to worry that in six months’ time I’m going to have to sit on the floor with a toothbrush,” she says, conjuring a scenario as unlikely for me as unaided flight.  When all else fails, deploy the dimmers. “Lighting is about adding atmosphere and making it cosy, not about creating a sterile environment,” says Gunter. Beware claims of “soft white” bulbs, she warns, and appealingly warm pictures, which could be Photoshopped. Check the box: “You need to make sure it’s 2,700 Kelvin.”  Hacks  The self-cleaning home remains a distant dream, but there are ways to make housework feel less overwhelming. For Debora Robertson, the author of Declutter: The Get Real Guide to Creating Calm from Chaos, a clutter-free home is a simpler place to clean and live. “Paring back means you never have to clean, mend, polish or dust those things again.”  Hoffman recommends “a mindset shift. Stop thinking of cleaning as a huge undertaking and starting thinking of it as a series of small, ongoing tasks you can mould and fit around your life. You can clean a room in one- to five-minute intervals, repeated over time.” She is also an advocate for asking for help – from friends or family if professional help isn’t feasible. “There’s a really interesting phenomenon where people have trouble keeping their own messes tidy, but can help someone else with theirs.”  There is nothing like opening the windows to freshen a room. Photograph: Christopher Owens/The Guardian  What makes the biggest difference for the least effort? Robertson is “obsessed” with airing rooms. “It’s the quickest improvement you can make. Throw windows open for at least 10 minutes every day and it’s instantly fresher.” Hammond finds clearing flat surfaces – tables, shelves, desks – disproportionately helpful. “It can make a huge visual difference.” Another easy win is making the bed: “Beds take up a lot of real estate in a room, so a neat bed can make everything else feel tidier, even if it’s not.”  My favourite advice, though, is MacKenzie’s. “Don’t move around the house at all. Every time you move, you’re shedding dead skin cells and hair. Just stand still in one place.” Finally, cleaning advice I am confident I can follow.

That revelation came flecked with green chilli and wrapped in a roti, and it was that, good as French omelettes might be, the Indian subcontinent arguably does them better. The masala omelette, or desi omelette, as it’s sometimes known, is a classic: a quick, filling breakfast for millions around the world, whether enjoyed at home in Lahore, by the roadside in Mumbai or in a cafe in Birmingham with a hot cup of chai on the side.  Though omelettes have been known in France, and Britain, since the Middle Ages, it seems probable that the idea originally came from Persia, and early European recipes called for them to be fried on both sides, just like a desi omelette. You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs but after that, anything goes.  The eggs  The creamy texture I like best in a French omelette is, in my opinion, achieved by beating the eggs lightly, so they’re well combined but without incorporating a lot of air into the mixture. Fans of the desi omelette, however, seem to prize a certain airiness of texture, with the Times of India instructing readers to “beat the eggs till frothy (the more you beat the egg the fluffier it will come out to be)”. To this end, some recipes also add milk, whose steam will help create little air bubbles in the end result, though I think it dilutes the richness of the eggs, so I’m willing to sacrifice a little fluff in the service of flavour.  I also, because the idea intrigues me, try a vegan take on the masala omelette from The Girl with a Spoon blog by a self-described “super foodie” called Madhura from Gurgaon, just south-west of Delhi. Instead of eggs, she makes a pancake-like batter with chickpea and rice flour, then proceeds as normal. The idea is a good one: because of the other ingredients in a masala omelette, the lack of egg is less noticeable than it would be in a plainer dish – though I think our cups must be different sizes, because I have to add a lot more liquid than is called for, and end up with a vast, thick pancake that’s hard to flip, while the one in the picture is thin and golden, almost like a dosa. So, vegans, you might need to play around a bit with the base, but I reckon the results are worth it.  The spices  You could leave the eggs be, and let the fillings do the talking, as in Asma Khan’s recipe, but in for a penny, in for a pound, and I miss the warmth that dried spices bring to proceedings: Mowgli’s Nisha Katona uses ground cumin and coriander, Meera Sodha and Maunika Gowardhan use turmeric and chilli powder, Tina, the Keralan cook behind the Kaipunyam blog, garam masala and Madhura turmeric and asafoetida, which is often included in vegan recipes to replicate the slightly sulphurous flavour of eggs. Up to you, but I like the earthiness of cumin, and am rather taken by cook, food stylist and photographer Shayma Owaise Saadat’s suggestion of roughly crushed whole seeds, which will also add texture, as well as turmeric for its bright colour and subtle bitterness.  The aromatics  Onions of some sort are a must for me; Katona uses red ones, which are probably closest to the pink onions common in the subcontinent, and Gowardhan, Tina and Madhura yellow ones, but I favour Sodha’s spring onions, because an omelette cooks so quickly that, unless you soften the chopped onion first, as Katona suggests, you’ll end up with crunchy, semi-raw onion (which I know others are fine with; I’m just not, especially first thing in the morning). The sharp, fresh flavour of spring onions also works well with the sweetness of the chopped tomatoes I like in Gowardhan and Madhura’s recipes, though, as with the peppers and other veg some call for, they’re very much optional.  I wouldn’t, however, leave out the green chillies; you could swap them for Katona’s red if you crave heat, but I enjoy the herbaceous flavour of the green sort. They, and the chopped coriander that she, Sodha and Gowardhan also put in, give the whole thing a delicious freshness. Those who are less keen on coriander’s flavour should at least consider a Keralan-style masala omelette with curry leaves instead. (Tina also flavours hers with grated coconut, which gives it a lovely, chewy texture – I’m going to keep my basic recipe simpler, but do give it a try if you have some knocking around.)  The cooking  If you’re new to the masala omelette game, forget everything you know about French-style omelettes; you need plenty of oil and a medium heat, because this omelette is going to be on there for longer than a soft, runny one, and you don’t want to burn it. Leave the omelette until it’s cooked through and beginning to colour on the bottom before flipping it to brown the other side. (To make it a bit more substantial, you could add a big handful of grated cheese, as Katona does, and finish it under the grill rather than turning it over.)  Though, of course, it will be delicious on its own, the masala omelette is even better paired with bread; at Mowgli, they roll it into a chapati with chutney, Gowardhan likes it stuffed into bread with a spritz of lemon juice and dunked in sweet chilli sauce and ketchup, while Sodha recommends putting it between two slices of buttered toast and finishing it off with ketchup and a Bollywood soundtrack. Possibly the most fun you can have in the kitchen in under 10 minutes.  Perfect masala omelette  Prep 5 min  Cook 5 min  Makes 1  ¼ tsp cumin seeds  2 eggs  ¼ tsp turmeric  1 good pinch of salt  1 spring onion, white and green parts, thinly sliced  1 large tomato, diced  1 medium green chilli, finely chopped (seeds removed if you don’t want too much heat)  10g (about 2¾ tbsp) roughly chopped fresh coriander  1 tbsp neutral oil  Put a medium (22cm-diameter or so) frying pan (or tava, if you have one) on a medium-high heat, add the cumin and fry until aromatic.  Tip into a mortar and roughly crush.  Beat the eggs in a jug until frothy, then whisk in the cumin, turmeric and salt …  … followed by all the other ingredients bar the oil.  Put the oil in the same pan over a medium heat and, once hot, give the eggs a final whisk and pour into the pan, swirling to coat the base.  Cook until just set on top and beginning to turn golden underneath, loosening the sides as they begin to dry out.  Carefully flip the omelette as you would a pancake, or turn over with a spatula, then cook until the other side is lightly golden, too.  Slide on to a plate and eat, preferably with bread and sauces.

This was in the days before the pandemic emptied rail carriages and transformed indoor public spaces into chambers of contagion. Unfolding across several posters, it went like this: “Explore risks that may be common in your family tree.” “See how DNA affects your health.” “Put your worries to test.”  The advertisement was clearly suggesting that the knowledge it sold would be beneficial to the customer, although why and in what ways were questions on which it demurred: not “mitigate” or “minimise” but “explore risks”. The claim seemed to be that knowing about one’s genetic predispositions to disease would be inherently good. Knowledge itself would be improving.  Yes, I thought. I could see myself doing that, in the spirit of exploration.  A few years earlier, my aunt died. It was very sudden, no one saw it coming. She was young – 44 – and not manifestly in ill health. One evening she went to bed, and the following morning she was carried downstairs. In the desultory, strange days that followed, we were of the understanding that she had suffered a cerebral event – an aneurysm or a stroke. Afterwards, this was corrected. No, it had in fact been her heart that malfunctioned.  For years afterwards I could never remember whether it was my aunt’s brain or her heart which was defective, and even now I am uncertain. I only remember that there was some initial confusion, now long since resolved, but which is the correct explanation and which is the false I continue to forget. I’ve asked my mother countless times to clarify matters, but – and not for any lack of interest on my part or clarity on hers – I do not seem capable of retaining the knowledge. My ignorance on the matter persists in spite, or perhaps because, of the possibility of a genetic link.  Throughout my early 20s, I spent a lot of time seeking to acquire knowledge about my body. It was unwell, this much was certain, and the question of how was one to which I applied myself studiously. Of course, I had theories. Looking back, these tended to change quite frequently. My research required me to enlist the help of doctors. Above all, I sought a scan that would light up every region of my body; that would reveal, clearly and distinctly, what was the matter with it. It is a long story; it went on for some time. Then something happened. One evening I fell sick. I had a fever, I didn’t sleep. Nevertheless, the following morning I felt fine, and went to work. But that evening the fever came back, this time worse. This cycle continued for a week or two.  At the time, I was an outreach worker. This was in 2012, or possibly 2013, relatively early in the days of austerity. It was January. The work involved traipsing the streets of north London to inform its elderly inhabitants of which services remained. I was working under the aegis of a new charity whose main funders were the councils in which it operated. I was paid handsomely for this work, but by the hour. What was more, it was seasonal; once temperatures reached double digits, this brief and surprisingly lucrative employment would cease.  Get the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning  I quickly adapted my routine to these new realities. I’d get up, without having slept, and put my bed sheets in the washing machine (time delay: seven hours). Then I’d cycle across the river. I’d walk around the council estates of north London, which were now mostly privatised, and knock on some doors. Then I’d cycle back to Camberwell, move my bed sheets from the washing machine to the dryer, eat dinner, wash up, read something and reinstall the freshly laundered sheets. Then I’d fix myself a drink and sit in bed and wait until, just after 11pm and always before 11.20, the fever began to gather. This proved to be surprisingly sustainable, until one day I collapsed on the stairs.  I took a morning off work to visit my GP. It was an expensive visit from the perspective of earnings potential. As usual, Dr C was patrician and inscrutable. His body had been trained over many years to give nothing away. He nodded as I explained what had happened, and then, as if dismissing everything I’d just said, he said, “OK, let’s have a look at you”. He placed a stethoscope on my back in order to listen to my lungs, placing his other hand against my chest to steady himself. His grip tightened, signifying something. He cleared his throat and composed himself. “Did you have any plans today, Mr Rees?”  He instructed me to go to A&E. They would X-ray me today; it would have to be today. I agreed to go straight there. After I left his office, Dr C followed me out into the stairwell and called out, “You will go straight there, won’t you?”  At the hospital I explained all this to the triage nurse. I was careful to leave nothing out, but also to make no embellishments. She nodded sympathetically and drank in every detail: his tightening grip, the atmosphere that hung about the room. His haunted tone as he called out to me across the waiting room. When my narrative was over she handed me a piece of paper and asked me to hand it in at reception. The paper read: “Feels unwell.”  Later that day, I had an X-ray. True enough, there was a “mass” in my lungs. Certainly, it was of some concern. But it was impossible to say what the mass was (“an X-ray machine is not a precise instrument, young man”). A long period of waiting followed, interrupted by the women who occasionally appeared to take samples of my blood. I regretted having brought nothing to read.  For many hours I sat there, bookless and bored, until a junior doctor appeared to tell me how things stood. The results that had come back were normal. Others would take longer. It was possible that I had a virus of some sort. That would explain the chest X-ray: it would be a lymph node, that was all. On the other hand, there were reasons to doubt it. My white cell count was normal. One would expect it to be raised. This did suggest that something more sinister might be going on, but it was too soon to be jumping to conclusions. I wasn’t to worry. I was to go now, get some rest. I was to come back tomorrow, when I would report to the Medical Assessment Centre.  Photograph: Stockimo/Alamy  Honestly, this was not unwelcome. In general, the parameters of any medical investigation are determined by the story that one tells about oneself. When one leaves a doctor’s office having been told, after a brief examination, not to worry, the feeling tends to be reassuring only in the short term. Before long, doubts set in. What if one has failed to give the really essential piece of information? What if the small detail which in the blur of the encounter slipped one’s mind, or which one deliberately withheld, what if this detail were the truly important thing, the stray thread which would have enabled the doctor to unweave the veil of health and reveal the sick body beneath? Such, at least, tended to be my experience. There is always more one can say, and if the patient fails to say the correct thing then any reassuring words uttered by the doctor will be worse than null; they will be a lure. And yet giving a good account of oneself, an account that will convince a doctor that one is worthy of their time, a reliable witness to one’s own body, is also about knowing what not to say. More really isn’t always more. It is a writer’s problem: what to put in, leave out. But the stakes are different.  The Medical Assessment Centre promised deliverance from the usual cycle of relief and regret. It promised that medicine’s investigations into my body would no longer depend upon my skill as a narrator. At the Medical Assessment Centre I would be reduced to a mute object of medical knowledge, anonymous and transparent like an anatomical drawing. The thought delighted me.  When I arrived the next morning at the Medical Assessment Centre, the receptionist, whom I had never met, knew my name. Actually, everyone there seemed to know me. Over the course of that morning people of various professions made reference to my “case”.  I changed into a hospital gown. A nurse came to take some blood and, to my surprise, left a cannula in my arm. “Oh?” I said. “Don’t worry, Mr Rees,” she said meaningfully. “For your procedure.” A few minutes later a hospital porter arrived with a wheelchair. “All right, Mr Rees, hop in.” It dawned on me that I might actually be a patient. It was an unlovely realisation that felt nothing at all like vindication. I declined, politely I believe, and said I was perfectly well enough to walk. The porter appeared hurt. He mumbled that he would have to check with the doctor. I nodded that he should do whatever he felt necessary as I gathered my belongings into my rucksack.  The porter returned, bearing no evident resentment, and as we made the short walk to the imaging unit he prattled cheerfully about this and that, the weather, his two young children, the extension he was building at his parents’ house. When we arrived, he withdrew quickly so that my delayed and oddly inflected “Goodbye” was addressed to his back as he receded through the double doors.  At the IU, I was injected with a coloured dye that made my arsehole dilate and I was passed several times through a noisy, large machine. It was the moment I’d been waiting for, my dream come true. Afterwards I was told (without the offer of a wheelchair) to retrace my steps to the Medical Assessment Centre. I sat around for an hour or two, time now completely lost to me, although its passing was tortuous, until the kindly, brusque Dr L appeared. “Look, it’s going to be a while. Go for a walk, get something to eat. OK?”  Dr L said he’d call me as soon as he had the results. Soon I was sitting in a dimly lit coffee shop holding a book, and after an hour, or some hours, I received the call from Dr L. His voice now sounded completely different, grave, formal, although it was difficult to know what to make of this since he belonged to a class and a generation whose members still possessed a “phone voice”.  I sensed that my fate was now known – not yet to me, but to someone. The facts of the matter had come to light; it only remained for them to be conveyed to me. As I stepped out into the street I had a sudden rush of appreciation for ignorance, which I now realised could be something more than a mere deficit. Ignorance could have a reality of its own, it could be a state of plenitude and possibility. It was a state in which I’d have liked to abide a little longer, perhaps indefinitely.  I thought about walking in the opposite direction to the hospital, to the Thames, perhaps, or to the City. I thought about never returning, taking my chances.  Of course, I walked straight to the hospital. It wasn’t only that a will to knowledge turned out to be the stronger drive. The pleasures of not knowing are necessarily belated. One can always choose not to know. But ignorance, consciously chosen, is nothing at all like innocence. When I returned, Dr L greeted me at the door. He told me to follow him into a private room, his voice still grave. I sat on the bed, he on the lid of a metal bin marked “biowaste”. On the computer screen were the results of a CT scan: my body, illuminated. I was surprised to find myself not feeling very anxious. It was not a feeling of calm that came over me, however; only abandonment to the implacable logic of the situation.  Dr L was going to cut to the chase. The scan showed what he had hoped it would not show, that all through my body my lymph nodes were enlarged. They were, in Dr L’s phrase, “standing to attention”, although he could not say why. What he was saying was, the image was clear enough. But he could not explain what it meant.  A disease was mentioned whose name had long been prominent in my daydreams and internet browsing history. Hearing its name said aloud (I think for the first time), this felt obscene and electrifying. Infection was mentioned, too, although it was with a tone of regret that Dr L reiterated that there was no elevation in my white cell count. It was of some concern that the enlarged nodes were distributed evenly above and beneath my diaphragm. “That will make it late-stage,” I offered. “The ones that concern me are in your chest,” he said. “They’re very deep.”  That I liked Dr L was partly because he always spoke as though enlisting your assistance to some shared task. He started every sentence with an imperative “Look”, and ended it with a rhetorical “OK?”. These were obvious affectations, which did not make them less effective; his style made any response feel weirdly pedantic, and in an infantilised desire to prove myself to Dr L by matching his aloofness, I could almost forget that the item under discussion was my own body.  “Look, nothing is certain yet. There’s still a chance that this is just an infection. In which case, in a couple of weeks you’re going to forget all about it. Get on with your life. But in the meantime, we’re going to have to do a lot more tests. OK?” I nodded. “Look, I know all this is frightening. But I can promise that we’re going to get to the bottom of this. So, come back here tomorrow at nine and we’ll get started, OK?” I nodded.  What followed was a fortnight during which I reported each morning to the Medical Assessment Centre. Sometimes, I spent an entire day there, other times it was only a fleeting visit to deposit a little blood en route to north London, whose elderly population awaited news about what would survive the cuts to public expenditure that were reported to be “swingeing” (one of those words that, everywhere for a short time, one rarely hears afterwards).  Many tests were performed, and aside from ordinary pleasantries I was rarely required to speak. I simply handed myself over. That the fever had gone by this time was not considered a reason to desist; now, and for the very first time, medicine had taken an interest in my body that had nothing to do with my experience of it.  One day I had a fine-needle biopsy to determine whether the cells that had clumped into masses inside my right armpit were cancerous; it would take a week or more for the results to come back. The intervening period was colourless and strange, and the waiting rooms in which I often sat came to seem like a metaphor for life itself. On the other hand, I was learning a lot. Partly by osmosis – I was spending so much time on the ward – and partly because of the hospital’s practice of copying patients in to all correspondence between its consultants and the patient’s GP. Due to a time lag of three or four days, these letters would always arrive a little out of sync with where things currently stood. This did not render them an irrelevance, however, since, addressed not to me but to my GP, they presented information about my case in a way that was completely unfamiliar.  A rendering of the lymphatic system. Photograph: Shubhangi Ganeshrao Kene/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF  The feeling when reading these letters was similar to overhearing a conversation about one’s behaviour at a recent party. The deviation from one’s own memory need not be great for it to kill one on the spot. In these curt yet suggestive letters there would frequently be reference to things that had never been discussed with me (“ACE level elevated”; “liver function abnormalities”; “inconclusive”) while matters I’d considered settled days earlier were repeatedly thrown back into question. And so while the letters fizzed with information – information I would immediately augment with further information drawn from Google searches – I tended to come away from having read them feeling more, not less, in the dark.  In the third volume of the Spheres trilogy – a towering philosophical history of the west – the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk argues that modernity is underwritten by “explication”, a process by which previously unscrutinised background aspects of life are drawn into the foreground. As this occurs, what had passed for simple is revealed in all its previously unimagined complexity: for instance, air, previously the undifferentiated medium of existence, is shown to be a mixture of gases subject to countless fluctuations. On the one hand, this increases our technical mastery over the environment; on the other, it brings a sense of vulnerability. There are so many ways that something complicated can go wrong.  As the critic Steven Connor has noted, revelation is always haunted by a feeling of not knowing. As previously unexpected areas of complexity are revealed, thoughts and suspicions loom about what else remains to be brought to light. Where previously there had been nothing at all, now there are depths waiting to be plumbed.  When, after a fortnight or so, it was revealed that I’d had glandular fever – this had initially been ruled out on the basis of an antibody test, but showed up on a subsequent test – I was delighted. It was like one of those criminal judgments in which the accused is given some trivial sentence and, having served this time awaiting trial, is free to go.  The feeling did not last, however. On the day the receptionist told me over the phone about the glandular fever result, I was due to report to the Medical Assessment Centre to get the result of the biopsy. I asked the receptionist if I should still make the appointment, now that we had an explanation. She asked me to hold the line while she discussed this with the consultant – a distant murmuring I could hear but not make out – and when she returned told me, emphatically, that I was indeed required to keep the appointment.  At the appointment, however, which so emphatically was necessary, and which I attended with a frank terror I had not experienced in the two weeks hitherto, the consultant said, after a long preamble about the marvels of the human immune system, that he was confident that the glandular fever result explained the abnormalities he’d found in my biopsy.  Photograph: Prakaymas vitchitchalao/Alamy  “So there were abnormalities in my biopsy?”  “No, no. Well, not once we take into account the glandular fever. I can tell you, I was happy to see that.”  “What about my ACE level?”  “What about it?”  “It’s elevated.”  “Oh, it is? Hmm.”  “And my liver function, it’s abnormal.”  “Well, in any case it’s nothing to worry about. You’re fine, Mr Rees.”  The consultant cheerfully handed me a form discharging me from the care of the Medical Assessment Centre. It was his way of asking me to leave.  I’d been an outpatient of the Medical Assessment Centre for a fortnight, or thereabouts. Now I was leaving, healthy. At home, letters continued to arrive for several days.  The charity I worked for did not give its casualised staff sick pay, and so I did not rest, as was advised. Quite the opposite, since my recent absences had been expensive. Probably the work did me good. My period of employment ended in the spring.  My memories of the period that followed are more clotted, much harder to give an account of besides the vaguest outlines. It is when I came closer than I ever have to madness. After a brief period of respite, doubts set in. There were so many things that did not make sense. I’d kept much of the correspondence between the hospital and the GP, which, now thumbed and coffee-stained, was full of incongruous details. It seemed to me to provide a lengthy record of leads unpursued.  I started to resemble poor Miss Flite from Bleak House, making myself a continual presence at the GP surgery and at the hospital, always, of course, with “my documents”. There were a good many things that I’d have liked to know, things I would have liked to clear up. A scan, I thought. That would do it. A scan that would light up every region of my body, revealing what was the matter with it. That would require me to enlist the help of doctors. It was a task to which I applied myself vigorously.  It was a dark time, which went on for many months, during which ordinary life, as it is wont, went on, too. And then at some point, without ever really concluding, that period of my life ended.  Now, I prefer not to know. I rarely visit doctors; my internet browsing history no longer resembles a diagnostic manual. It has been this way for some years. I don’t know how this happened exactly. It was only possible, afterwards, to observe that I no longer paid any heed to my health. A few years ago I began writing about all this; the fact might be relevant. If I were to become sick now I’d probably be the last to realise. I don’t know that this necessarily represents an advance, but certainly it has made life pleasanter.  A few weeks ago I noticed a lymph node the size of a conker in my right armpit, and then another. A few days later I visited the doctor, who suggested sending me for an ultrasound. A few days after that, a text message arrived containing a link through which I could book the hospital appointment. The earliest one was four days later, but I could choose from the many available appointments, in various convenient locations, the one that suited me best.  I have not yet booked the appointment, although I have thought of doing so many times. The lymph nodes remain enlarged. I do not feel frightened, but I do continue to put it off. I have been busy, writing. It is only now, in the very final stages of editing this essay, that the thought occurs to me (it is a thought that makes me smile) that these two things – the appointment I haven’t made, and the essay I have been writing – could be related.

After loading it from a stranger’s backyard into the bed of our truck, we walked to The Chef, a downtown diner, figuring we might be seated quickly with half the town tailgating at the Kansas State University football game.  We drank bloody Marys on the patio among white, Black and brown diners while purple school flags waved in the autumn breeze. Our server pointed to a pile of blankets in case I got chilly.  When we left, I handed my blanket to a trio of thick men eating bacon and wearing hunting gear. “In case you get chilly,” I said. They laughed. Then the server, who was wearing facial hair, makeup, men’s shoes, pearls and a crop top, refilled their coffee cups.    Unfashionable places such as Kansas – “one of the square ones in the middle,” coastal acquaintances have said to me with a smile and a shrug – are often portrayed by Hollywood and news headlines as a homogenous expanse of “uneducated,” white, straight, cis-gendered conservatives who are cooking meth or terrorizing outsiders.  Perhaps that is because most of those employed as storytellers or gatekeepers in film, television or the national media industry have led urban lives geographically removed from regions condescendingly known as “flyover country.” I have been a journalist for 20 years and have never once, to my knowledge, worked with another journalist who had direct experience of rural life or agricultural labor, not to mention economic poverty in any setting.  Yet here we were, that sunny Saturday, living amid a richness omitted by prevailing narratives: the Spanish-named woman whom I paid for the tub, the server who refuted gender norms while working for tuition money, hunters with deer blood on their pants, my leftist-carpenter husband, and this farm girl who had returned home following professional stints in major cities.  A few months later, I watched the HBO show Somebody Somewhere, improbably set in Manhattan, Kansas. The second episode includes a brunch scene at The Chef involving a biracial gay couple, a transgender agriculture professor wearing purple and a farm girl who returned home. I suspect that, offscreen, the latter’s browser history contained tutorials on how to refinish an old bathtub.  The exquisite accuracy of the show – shocking and even moving to a resident of a region more often misrepresented, lampooned or altogether ignored in popular culture – is not just in its unceremonious diversity. It is in its authentic set design, over which Kansans I know have pointed and exclaimed with glee. There’s a candle poured by that company in Ellinwood! A bag of chips from the Kansas City snack factory! The local craft beer, the local-dive T-shirt, the real-life storefronts – on the same TV screen at which we have spent a lifetime groaning when “Kansas” has mountains on the horizon.  As it happens, Somebody Somewhere, the first season finale of which aired last Sunday, was filmed outside Chicago. Landscape shots thus feature corn fields rather than Kansas’s more common export, wheat. But those steering the show know firsthand the town and region they depict. Star and executive producer Bridget Everett is from Manhattan, Kansas, while creators Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen are both from the midwest.  Together they give us not just uber-cred detail but regional and rural ubiquities: the Ford Ranger pickup, the small gift shop selling potpourri, the amiable neighbor dealing fentanyl, the antique milk churn on a patio, the dangerous grain bin. The braless, heavy-set grocery shopper in Walmart sweats is there, too – not as the butt of a joke but as the talented, compelling star of the show.  Forgoing the caricature of rurality as frighteningly remote and disconnected, Somebody Somewhere also nails the liminality of town and country, for many. The main character, Sam, works, eats, shops and sleeps in Manhattan – which, with a population of 50,000, is not small by Kansas standards – and makes a short drive to visit her folks’ struggling farm. The show even manages to handle my state’s love-hate relationship with The Wizard of Oz, referenced both in overarching theme and tongue-in-cheek plot points, without offense.  To get a place wrong, over and over again, is at once an insult to and an invalidation of its people. To get a place right, then, is a healing of sorts.  When my 2018 book Heartland was published, I heard from thousands of readers who were relieved and delighted to recognize in its pages their unsexy place, or a place much like it. The book is an intersectional critique of our ill-addressed socioeconomic class structure, my family’s rural poverty serving as a springboard to analyzing US history, policy and culture. But many readers just wanted to tell me where they were from. Across lines of race, religion, class and political ideology, from the rural south to small-town Idaho to upstate New York, they essentially said, “You captured a place like mine, and now I feel seen and understood.”  National headlines often reduce such places to strictly political frameworks: how do they vote and why? The esteemed panel confidently answering these questions rarely includes someone from the place being discussed. The resulting blind spots lead to false estimations, as a roundly stunned national media proved during the 2016 presidential election.  At a moment when our social fabric is tearing, we would do well to look at the true threads of every unseen and misunderstood place. Efforts to diversify the powerful spaces that tell stories and create culture – newsrooms, publishers, Hollywood writers’ rooms – must address place, geography and class as identity markers.  Somebody Somewhere proves that doing so is not at odds with other forms of inclusion but, rather, elevates accuracy in intersectional ways.  Jeff Hiller, who plays the sweet white dork Joel, recently reflected on finding a script about not just the hardship of fitting into a small town as a queer person but the beautiful ways people do so. Hiller, whose character introduces Sam to an upbeat group of misfits and queers who gather in a church space, had a parallel experience in real life.  “I went to Texas Lutheran College in a small farming town, and there was this one female pastor who held church services on Saturday evenings where we’d have champagne and it was all queer folks,” Hiller told the website Them. “(There) we could be authentic, genuine people, and we were accepted. So when I read the pilot and saw this character who was gay – for the most part openly gay – and also a member of a faith community, I was shocked … I can’t think of any other examples of a faith community on TV with queer people in it who aren’t being persecuted.”  In the show’s resoundingly positive reviews, much has been made of Sam’s struggle to fit in after moving home to care for her dying sister. She’s a white farmer’s daughter but also progressive and offbeat – how will she ever be content there, where women collect throw pillows and cook casseroles for their husbands? The question, presented by the show overtly, understandably resonates with TV critics choosing to live in hip, sophisticated environments.  Worth equal consideration, though, is the fact that Joel, who is no less progressive and offbeat, is happy in that same place – volunteering for community causes, dreaming of raising children with his brown-skinned boyfriend and probably collecting throw pillows in a town where bitchy homophobes and thriving homosexuals coexist. Joel is not in Manhattan, Kansas, because he couldn’t make it in Manhattan, New York. He is there because, as he defends it to Sam, “This is where I live.”  Sam’s trajectory, meanwhile, is not the linear American dream – to “get out,” climb up the ladder and never look back – but the circular journey of the hero who returns home. She never did much climbing, it turns out, and “getting out” – even for those deemed successful – is always an illusion. We carry our backstories with us, and many who leave are eventually summoned home, whether by familial duties or an abiding affection for the complicated place that shaped them.  One real-life homecomer, Skylar Baker-Jordan, recently wrote for The Daily Yonder about returning to his tiny hometown in Kentucky. Upon moving to Chicago, he found himself defending his home when repeatedly asked what it was like to be gay in the rural south.  “My answer, that actually I didn’t have such a bad time of things after high school, always seemed to disappoint folks,” Baker-Jordan wrote. “It was as if they wanted to hear I had spent the better part of my life running from rednecks in pickup trucks firing rifles at me. In reality, those rednecks were my family and friends.”  Filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung juxtaposed identities of race, ethnicity and place with his semi-autobiographical, award-winning 2020 film Minari, about Korean immigrants in rural Arkansas.  “Everyone always talks about the immigrant stuff. To me, this is an Arkansas story or a farming story,” Chung told the Arkansas Times. “There were a lot of people on set from Oklahoma, and on set I felt like there was this interesting divide between the Korean people and the local Oklahoma people. I’m kind of in between both.”  Many in our society are untethered from home by the forces of capitalism, the disembodiment that the digital age engenders and the homogenizing cultural effects of globalization. The class that joins Hollywood meetings via Zoom calls from tropical beaches might even fancy itself post-place. What some of them miss, and what Somebody Somewhere makes us laugh and cry by revealing, is that in this moment of cultural division, place is a tie that very much still binds.  In another recent hit show, Ted Lasso, the title character leaves Kansas to coach British footballers. Lasso, whom creator and star Jason Sudeikis based on his real-life high school coach in Kansas, relishes the professional opportunity but longs for his broken family back home. Tig Notaro’s acclaimed dark comedy One Mississippi, which shares Somebody Somewhere’s themes of mortality and homecoming, occasionally leans on regional stereotypes for a laugh but treats Notaro’s native small-town Mississippi with fairness and affection. It is possible to write a story or create a show that scorns or diminishes the place you’re from, but these shows successfully handle place because of their creators’ geographic identities.  In one of the Somebody Somewhere’s most touching moments, the cheerful agriculture professor, Fred, stands in a field advising Sam’s aging father, Ed, to plant cover crops for soil regeneration. Ed, played by Mike Hagerty, sounds like the actor’s native Chicago but conjures for me my gentle, suspenders-wearing grandfather all the same. He laments the challenge of long-term planting strategies when survival of the farm is a short-term concern. Fred, played by the famed drag king Murray Hill, consoles him, saying, “You’re a real good steward of your land.”  Their dialogue was the first time I have seen a character onscreen offer the highest compliment, where I’m from – to say, in essence, “you do well by this place.”  Storytellers, in Hollywood and beyond, should seek to do the same.

Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) bars the procedure once embryonic cardiac activity is detected, typically at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier, with no exception for rape or incest. As most people are not aware they are pregnant this early on, the unprecedented law amounts to a near-total ban.  It also delegates enforcement to private citizens, in lieu of the state, encouraging anti-choice vigilantes to sue abortion providers as well as anyone who “aids or abets” care for damages of at least $10,000, creating a chilling effect among abortion supporters.  Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas, described the panic, fear and anguish of patients unable to obtain constitutionally protected healthcare in their home state. She said her clinic staff had transformed counseling sessions into trauma and grief support, coupled with travel logistics advice.  “For six months we have heard the cries and pleas of Texans who have had their healthcare freedoms stripped away,” Hagstrom Miller said in a recent press briefing. “In many cases, there is nothing we can do for them other than listen, hold their hands and dry their tears.”  Under SB 8, abortions in Texas have fallen by almost 50%. Texans have been forced to travel hundreds – or even thousands – of miles for abortion access, with an average distance that is 14 times greater than before, according to the Guttmacher Institute.  This is only if they can find the necessary resources including time off work, childcare, lodging, transportation and others necessary to cross state lines. Some Texans are being forced to carry pregnancies against their will, providers say. They stress the impact of SB 8 falls hardest on low-income people and black and brown communities.  “Senate Bill 8 has been absolutely devastating for Texas communities, especially for people who call on abortion funds for support,” says Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund.  Abortion funds that offer financial assistance to low-income patients and people of color said they were now spending “six times more” on travel expenses under SB 8 in a video detailing the impact of the law.  Anna Rupani of Fund Texas Choice says the number of people leaving Texas for abortion care has risen fivefold among those they help. Similarly, Kamyon Conner of Texas Equal Access Fund reports 91% of those who call the non-profit are in need of out-of-state care.  “People in this state are being forced to travel for healthcare,” Conner said. “We need the support of everyone in the country right now.”  Planned Parenthood recently released new data showing a nearly 800% increase in Texas patients at their health centers in nearby states, including New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado and Missouri in the first four months of SB 8 compared with last year. Planned Parenthood clinics in Oklahoma alone saw a nearly 2,500% increase in patients from Texas.  “These numbers are staggering and just one part of the devastating picture on the ground in Texas and the surrounding states,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.  “[T]he country’s most restrictive abortion ban has led to continued chaos and a sustained crisis for patients and providers in Texas and beyond. This reality is heartbreaking and a glimpse of what’s to come should the supreme court restrict the constitutional right to an abortion even further.”  Women protest for reproductive rights at the Texas state capitol in Austin on 2 October 2021 Photograph: Stephen Spillman/AP  Clinics in neighboring states have become overburdened with an influx of patients, causing a ripple effect across the US reproductive health network.  Kathaleen Pittman, clinic administrator at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, said in her 30 years as a provider she had “never been so afraid” for her patients, most of whom live at or below the poverty level. With a nearly 50% jump in Texas patients, the clinic is “overloaded” and cannot schedule appointments until one month out.  “Our staff is exhausted and the phone calls are nonstop,” says Pittman. “Women are crying because they can’t understand how a state can have so much control over their lives.”  Despite legal efforts from Texas abortion advocates, the US supreme court – now stacked with conservative anti-abortion justices – failed to halt the extreme measure on more than one occasion and has largely stripped providers of their power to challenge the law. In January, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals asked the Texas supreme court to determine if narrow challenges against state medical licensing officials can proceed, and providers await that decision. However, they consider the move by the conservative fifth circuit an attempt to “further slow-walk the case” and allow SB 8 to remain in place indefinitely.  “The supreme court greenlit this law’s unprecedented vigilante scheme and essentially said that federal courts are powerless to stop it. There is no end in sight to this nightmare,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and arguing attorney for the plaintiffs.  “What is happening in Texas should be a grave warning for the rest of the country. This is a preview of what will happen on a much larger scale if Roe falls.”  The US supreme court is poised to overturn or undermine the pivotal 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that guarantees the right to abortion care. The upcoming decision, in response to a 15-week Mississippi abortion ban, is expected in June. In addition to SB 8, Texas passed a “trigger law” that would automatically bar all abortion care if Roe falls.  The Women’s Health Protection Act, a measure that would codify Roe into federal law – and potentially help Texans – was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday.  “This is a tragedy. Abortion providers alone cannot fix this,” Hagstrom Miller said of SB 8. “This should not be the reality of abortion care in the United States.”

Legal Notices and Deletions  10.1. Where the Delivery Method(s) to the Client includes the Content API, the Clauses pertaining to legal notices and deletions as set out in the Content API Conditions of Use attached as Schedule A shall apply in place of Clauses 10.2 to 10.4 below.  10.2. The Client acknowledges that on occasion, either during the Agreement Term or following termination of this Agreement, GNM may need to remove from, or cease circulation of, certain parts of the Services for legal reasons and accordingly the Client shall, on receipt of a notice from GNM by the Client’s Legal Contact Name(s), cease to reproduce or distribute the relevant part of the Services, including where relevant the immediate removal from any Digital Media.

Equitable Relief  17.1. Both parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Services belonging to GNM are a unique and valuable asset of GNM. Use of the Services in breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable injury to GNM for which monetary damages alone shall not be an adequate remedy.  17.2.

A party shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that this failure or delay is the direct result of a Force Majeure Event, provided that the Affected Party has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or overcome that failure. If the Force Majeure Event prevents the Affected Party from materially complying with its obligations under this Agreement and it continues for more than 30 days, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice.  18.5. Neither party shall assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent except that no consent shall be required for an assignment or transfer of GNM’s rights and obligations under this Agreement to any entity within its Group.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties. No party shall have the authority to bind the other party or to contract in the name of or create a liability against the other party in any way for any purpose.  18.8.

Client shall provide complete and accurate information when registering for the API Key.  1.2. Client shall access the Content API and request the Services only using the API Key registered to the Client Service(s). API Keys are granted to the Client on a non-transferable basis and shall not be shared by the Client with any third party.  2. Use of the Content API  2.1. In addition to Client agreeing to be bound by the Licence and Rights to Use as set out under Clause 4 of the Terms and Conditions above, Client shall not use the Content API or the Services in any manner that is not expressly authorised in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall not:  2.1.1. make service calls via the Content API in a quantity or manner that is not reasonably necessary to carry out Client’s obligations or exercise Client’s rights under this Agreement; or  2.1.2. modify, edit, disassemble, decompile or reverse-engineer the Content API without the prior written approval of GNM; or  2.1.3. disable or otherwise interfere with the proper functioning of the Content API; or  2.1.4. create, or facilitate the creation of, additional registration accounts or other technology for the purpose of accessing, or facilitating third party access to, the Content API without permission; or  2.1.5. present the Services in any manner that seeks to replicate, or pass off the Client Services, as a resource belonging to or endorsed by GNM; or  2.1.6. use headlines from the Services to create links to any content other than the full text of the underlying article in its original format.  2.2. For legal reasons Client shall be strictly required either to replace (by re-requesting from the Content API) or to delete all of the Services (whether or not published in the Client Services) at least every twenty-four (24) hours during the Agreement Term.  2.3. GNM may at its sole discretion withdraw the Services or any element thereof from the Content API. Should GNM withdraw the Services or any element thereof from the Content API, Client shall make commercially reasonable efforts to terminate display of such Services to end users of the Client Services within a reasonable period of time following GNM’s withdrawal of such Services.  3. Crediting  3.1. Client shall:  3.1.1. retain: (i) the full text and/or HTML headline, byline and link to www.theguardian.com in the Services; (ii) any disclaimer footnote, correction or other notice that is contained within the Services; and (iii) all links to external websites contained within the Services; and  3.1.2. include a link to the original article published on www.theguardian.com in all Services published in the Client Services.  3.2.

In the event that the Client Services allows end users of the Client Services to view the Services offline, Client shall track usage in the Client Services and provide the information to GNM the first time the end user using the Client Services has a network connectivity.  4. Legal Issues, Notices and Deletions  4.1. Client shall:  4.1.1. follow the instructions contained in any legal or other notice that GNM issues to Client in respect of the Services (which may require Client to cease using certain elements of the Services).

Such third parties may impose their terms of use on Client in respect of the area of the Content API under their control.

Equitable Relief  15.1. Both parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Services belonging to GNM are a unique and valuable asset of GNM.

Therefore, the parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement, GNM shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief or other relief prohibiting any breach of this Agreement without giving an undertaking as to damages. Any such remedy shall be in addition to and not in lieu of, other appropriate relief at law to which GNM may be entitled.  16. General  16.1. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.  16.2. The parties do not intend for any third party to have any rights under this Agreement by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.  16.3.

This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties in relation to its subject matter. Any variation to this Agreement must be agreed in writing by the parties. In the event of any conflict between any provision of the Non-Subscription Sales Term Sheet and these Non-Subscription Sales Terms and Conditions, the provisions of the Non-Subscription Sales Term Sheet shall prevail.  16.5. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties. No party shall have the authority to bind the other party or to contract in the name of or create a liability against the other party in any way for any purpose.  16.7. No failure or delay by any party in exercising its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right preclude any further exercise of any other right.  17.

Klitschko, who enlisted in Ukraine's reserve army earlier this month, posted the message on Twitter and Instagram urging immediate action against 'Russian aggression', or be at risk of further escalation. 'In an hour, or by tomorrow, it's going to be too late. Please get into action now, don't wait. Act now.' Wladimir and his brother Vitali, who is now mayor of Kyiv, have been outspoken during the invasion, with the latter saying he would be willing to fight alongside his brother in the 'bloody war'.

He did not say where.  "The minimum programme: humanitarian corridors," he said. Neither side has suggested it was expecting breakthroughs after a first round of talks held in Belarus on Monday led to no progress.  Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling the Kyiv government it describes as dangerous nationalists who threaten its security, Russia has captured only one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson, which its tanks entered on Wednesday.  With its main assault force halted for days on a highway north of Kyiv, Russia has shifted tactics, escalating its bombardment of major cities. Swathes of central Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, have been blasted into rubble.  Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, has been surrounded under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. The city council compared the situation to the World War Two siege of Leningrad. read more  'NOTHING TO LOSE'  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stayed in Kyiv, releasing regular video updates to the nation.

In Borodyanka, a small town 60 km (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv where locals had repelled a Russian assault, burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. Flames from one burning apartment building lit up the pre-dawn sky.  "They started shooting from their APC towards the park in front of the post office," a man recounted in the apartment where he was sheltering with his family, referring to a Russian armoured personnel carrier.  "Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again.  "An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!...Give me some petrol, we'll make a Molotov cocktail and burn the tank!'."  1/9 An aerial view shows a residential building destroyed by shelling in the settlement of Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, Ukraine March 3, 2022. REUTERS/Maksim Levin Read More  At least nine people were killed and four wounded in a Russian air strike that hit two schools and private houses in the eastern Chernihiv region on Thursday, governor Viacheslav Chaus said in an online post.  Footage from a car dashboard camera, verified by Reuters, showed buildings in a residential area in Chernihiv hit by apparent missiles. The street was engulfed in a fireball and a huge cloud of black smoke rose into the sky.  Two cargo ships came under apparent attack at Ukrainian ports. Four crew members were missing after Estonian-owned ship exploded and sank off Odessa, and at least one crew member was killed in a blast on a Bangladeshi ship at Olvia. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain and food oil exporters from its Black Sea ports.  'YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF'  Amid Moscow's increasing diplomatic isolation, only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia against an emergency resolution at the United Nations General Assembly condemning Moscow's "aggression".  Putin spoke by telephone to French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, telling him Russia would achieve its goals, including the demilitarisation and neutrality of Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Macron told Putin "you are lying to yourself", about the government in Kyiv, and said the war would cost Russia dearly, a French official said. read more  In Beijing, organisers sent Russian and Belarusian athletes home from the Paralympic Games, saying Moscow and Minsk were to blame for violating the Olympic Truce. Russia called the ban "monstrous". read more  In Russia itself, where nearly all major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled in a crackdown over the past year, the authorities have banned reporting that describes the "special military operation" as an "invasion" or "war".  Ekho Moskvy radio, the best-known independent broadcaster of the post-Soviet era and one of Russia's few remaining liberal voices, shut itself down on Thursday after authorities ordered it off the air.  Riot police snatched peaceful protesters off the streets in St Petersburg late on Wednesday, including a 77-year-old woman filmed being muscled away by men in black helmets. Activists distributed footage of a small girl weeping behind bars, having been arrested for holding up a sign that said "No war".  STALLED ADVANCE  Military analysts say Russia's advance has been a tactical fiasco, with poorly maintained columns now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud. Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.  "The longer Russian forces sit forward, the lower their readiness and performance will be. Everything from state of tires, to supply availability, and in the end morale," he tweeted.  The great fear is that, as the likelihood of rapid victory recedes, Russia will fall back on tactics it used in Syria and Chechnya, where it pounded the cities of Aleppo and Grozny to ruins.  Russia has already acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed. Ukrainian authorities have offered to free Russian prisoners if their mothers come fetch them.  Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is the only significant urban centre to fall. Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said he had asked the Russians who entered city hall "not to shoot people".  The International Criminal Court's top prosecutor said an advance team had left The Hague for the Ukraine region on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians and says its aim is to "disarm" Ukraine and arrest leaders it falsely calls neo-Nazis. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Natalia Zinets, Aleksandar Vasovic in Ukraine and other Reuters bureaux, Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Alex Richardson and Angus MacSwan  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS  March 2 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation.  Here is how Russia's chain of command would work in the event of a nuclear weapon launch.  WHO DECIDES TO LAUNCH RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS?  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  A 2020 document called "Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence" says the Russian president takes the decision to use nuclear weapons.  A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff.  IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS?  The Russian General Staff has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts.  DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY?  Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on "enhanced" combat duty. read more  The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean. read more  Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities.  DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES?  The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons:  -- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies;  -- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies;  -- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions;  -- the use of conventional weapons against Russia "when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy".  WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE?  The Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine. read more  HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR?  No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.

Picture taken March 1, 2022. REUTERS/Mahmoud Hassano  Summary Millions of Syrians displaced since conflict broke out in 2011  EU states received hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in days  Media contrast between Ukraine and other war zones criticised  SIDON, Lebanon/AMMAN, March 2 (Reuters) - Syrian refugee Ahmad al-Hariri, who fled the war in his country for neighbouring Lebanon 10 years ago, spent the last decade hoping in vain to escape to a new life in Europe.  Watching European nations open their arms to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in less than a week, the father of three can't help but compare their fates.  "We are wondering, why were Ukrainians welcome in all countries while we, Syrian refugees, are still in tents and remain under the snow, facing death, and no one is looking to us?" he told Reuters in a refugee centre where 25 families are sheltered on the edge of the Mediterranean city of Sidon.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In the Arab world, where 12 million Syrians have been uprooted by war, critics ranging from Hariri to activists and cartoonists contrast the Western reaction to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the way Europe sought to hold back Syrian and other refugees in 2015.  Some recalled images of refugees walking for days in harsh weather, or losing lives in perilous sea crossings as they tried to breach Europe's borders.  On Monday, four days after Russia launched its attack, the European Union said at least 400,000 refugees had entered the bloc from Ukraine, which has land borders with four EU states.  Millions more are expected and the EU is preparing measures which would offer temporary residence permits as well as access to employment and social welfare - a swift opening of its doors at odds with its response to wars in Syria and elsewhere.  By early 2021, 10 years after Syria's conflict erupted, EU states had taken in 1 million Syrian refugees and asylum seekers, of which Germany alone took more than half. Most of them arrived before a 2016 deal in which the EU paid billions of euros for Turkey to continue hosting 3.7 million Syrians.  This time the welcome has been immediate.  "We have here not the refugee wave which we are accustomed to and we do not know what to do with - people with an unclear past," Bulgaria's Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said, describing Ukrainians as intelligent, educated and highly qualified.  "These are Europeans whose airport has been just bombed, who are under fire," he said. Bulgaria has said it will help everyone coming from Ukraine, where there are about 250,000 ethnic Bulgarians.  Last year 3,800 Syrians sought protection in Bulgaria and 1,850 were granted refugee or humanitarian status. Syrians say most refugees only pass through Bulgaria to wealthier EU states.  Poland's government, which came under heavy international criticism last year for pushing back against a wave of immigrants crossing over from Belarus, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, has welcomed those fleeing the Ukraine war.  In Hungary, which built a barrier along its southern border to prevent a repeat of the 2015 influx of people from the Middle East and Asia, the arrival of refugees from neighbouring Ukraine has triggered an outpouring of support and offers of transport, short-term accommodation, clothes and food.  "RELATIVELY CIVILISED"  Hungary and Poland both say that refugees from the Middle East who arrive at their borders have already crossed other safe countries which have a duty to provide shelter.  Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto defended the different approaches. "I must reject drawing comparisons between those fleeing war and those trying to get into the country illegally," he told a United Nations meeting in Geneva.  The welcome has been eased by the fact that Ukraine is home to a large ethnic Hungarian community.  Ties like those have led some Western journalists to suggest that the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine is different to crises in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, because Europeans could relate more closely to the victims.  Their comments sparked a wave of condemnation on social media, accusing the West of bias. Clips of the reports were widely circulated and heavily criticised across the region.  For instance, a television reporter on U.S. network CBS described Kyiv as a "relatively civilised, relatively European" city, in contrast to other war zones. Others said Ukraine was different because those fleeing were middle class or watched Netflix.  The CBS reporter Charlie D’Agata apologised, saying he had been trying to convey the scale of the conflict. CBS did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.  Nadim Houry, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative, said parts of the media coverage were disturbing and revealed "ignorance about refugees from other parts of the world who also have the same aspirations as Ukrainians".  FIGHTERS  Houry and other critics also say some governments are showing double standards on the issue of volunteers who want to fight in Ukraine against Russian forces.  Britain's foreign minister Liz Truss on Sunday backed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's appeal for people to join an international force to fight Russian troops. "Absolutely. If people want to support that struggle, I would support them doing that," she told BBC television.  In contrast, British police warned Britons travelling to Syria to help the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad eight years ago that they could be arrested on their return, saying they may pose a security risk to the UK.  The foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Truss's remarks. Defence minister Ben Wallace said the situation was different to fighters who joined groups like Islamic State in Syria, but that the government would discourage people from going to Ukraine.  While their sense of abandonment has been heightened by the Ukrainians' welcome in eastern Europe, several refugees in north Syria, Lebanon and in Jordan told Reuters responsibility for their plight lay with authorities closer to home.  Some say Arab countries should have done more to support the military struggle against Assad, which grew out of widespread popular protests against the president in 2011, and helped the refugees more. Apart from Syria's neighbours Jordan and Lebanon, Arab countries have taken in few of the war's displaced people.  "We do not blame European countries, we blame Arab countries," said Ali Khlaif, living in a tented camp near the northwestern Syrian town of Azaz. "European countries welcome those from their people. We blame our Arab brethren, not the rest."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its second week on Thursday an apparent tactical failure so far, with its main assault force stalled for days on a highway north of Kyiv and other advances halted at the outskirts of cities it is bombing into wastelands.  The number of refugees who have fled Ukraine rose to more than 1 million, the United Nations said. Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed, and Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began Thursday morning with attacks by land, sea and air in what was immediately the largest military assault by one European state on another since World War Two. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”

Brent crude oil rose more than 5% to within a whisker of $120 per barrel before settling at $114.

In Asia, the rush to commodities lifted resource-rich Australian stocks (.AXJO) 0.49%.  Japan's Nikkei (.N225) managed a 0.7% gain, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) nudged up 0.39%.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski  A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao  Minutes from the European Central Bank's February meeting are due later on Thursday but last month's shock hawkish pivot seems like distant history now.  With Brent crude up some $30 a barrel since mid-February and European gas prices more than doubling in this period, the ECB will be looking with alarm at spiralling inflation expectations; Ten-year German 'breakevens', which reflect future inflation, have jumped 40 basis points since that February ECB meeting .  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Shorter-dated breakevens are above 4%.  And while estimates vary widely of how the war will impact euro zone GDP, a growth hit is certain and that's dampening the likelihood of near-term policy tightening.  With markets paring expectations of an ECB rate rise this year, swathes of the regional bond market are back into negative-yield territory. Moves are more pronounced in "real" yields - borrowing costs after stripping out inflation -- German 10-year real yields are at record lows below -2%.  U.S. Treasury real yields recovered a touch on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell clearly signalled a quarter-point rate rise was on the cards at the Fed's March 15-16 meeting. (Though ten-year real yields around -0.9% are still half where they were earlier this month).  Stock markets are reflecting this transatlantic divide, and Citi advise clients to add exposure to U.S. stocks, in particular the tech sector which benefits from falling real yields. But they also remain positive on commodity-heavy UK stocks.  European stocks are opening weaker, despite a strong Wall Street close following Powell's clear signal that a 50 bps rate rise is unlikely.  The bad news continues to pour in on the Russia front.

Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS  Summary U.S. wants action from suppliers to tame oil prices  OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia has spare oil capacity  OPEC+ not budging on output plans despite Ukraine crisis  Prince misses Olympics trip for Biden call - sources  Saudi wants more U.S. support in Yemen war - sources  DUBAI, March 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince says he simply doesn't care whether Joe Biden misunderstands him.  The prince is instead looking to his oil power to deliver his goals, according to sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking: recognition from the American president that he's the real ruler of the kingdom and a stronger hand in the costly Yemen war.  That's one reason why Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is resisting U.S. pressure to pump more crude to lower the price of oil that has surged since Russia attacked Ukraine, besides keeping Riyadh's oil pact with Moscow alive, the sources said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The Saudis have demands too, before they meet any of the U.S. requests. The Yemen file and the recognition of the crown prince as the de facto ruler are on top of these," one of the sources familiar with Saudi government thinking told Reuters.  Traditionally strong ties between Riyadh and Washington were shaken when Biden released a U.S. intelligence report implicating Prince Mohammed in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and ended U.S. support for offensive operations in Riyadh's costly war against Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen.  So far, Biden has refused to speak to Prince Mohammed directly, saying 86-year-old King Salman is his counterpart - even though the young prince effectively runs the kingdom and had a close relationship with Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.  In an interview with The Atlantic published on Thursday, Prince Mohammed said his aim was to strengthen Riyadh's long, historical relationship with Washington, but he was not concerned about whether Biden misunderstood him. read more  "Simply, I do not care," the crown prince was quoted as saying. "It's up to him to think about the interests of America."  The Saudi authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Prince Mohammed, who is known as MbS, denies any involvement in Khashoggi's death.  Riyadh has repeatedly stressed the strength of its strategic partnership with the United States and that its oil policy is based on a commitment to market stability and supply security driven by market fundamentals.  ONLY CARD TO PLAY  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies led by Russia have been unwinding historic output cuts they instated in 2020 to boost prices after the coronavirus pandemic caused an unprecedented fall in global demand.  But since Russian troops moved into Ukraine last week and the West hit Moscow with stringent sanctions, oil prices have surged to the highest since 2012 on concerns about disruptions to supply, with little global spare capacity to pump more crude.  Washington would like the producer alliance, known as OPEC+, to increase output faster than it has been doing since August but only a few countries have spare capacity, including de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The U.S. State Department's special envoy for energy affairs, Amos Hochstein, flew to Riyadh last month for talks about managing the potential impact on oil markets if Russia were to invade Ukraine - which it did a week later.  "MbS's only card is oil policy to press the Americans to give him what he wants, which is recognition and weapons for Yemen," said a second source familiar with Saudi thinking.  On Wednesday, the OPEC+ alliance stuck to its long-standing plans for gradual increases in output of 400,000 barrels per day each month, rather than boosting supply faster. read more  "Saudi Arabia ... has sought not to be seen acting against Russian interests. In doing so, the kingdom could kill two birds with one stone: keep the door open to Moscow and give President Joe Biden some payback for his refusal to engage with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman," wrote James Dorsey, a senior fellow at National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute.  In a sign of his eagerness to be part of the conversation with Washington, Prince Mohammed cancelled a trip to China for the Winter Olympics to ensure he was at his father's side when Biden called King Salman bin Abdulaziz on Feb. 9, three sources told Reuters.  In the call, which covered energy, Iran and Yemen, the king spoke about maintaining market stability and emphasised the need to maintain the OPEC+ pact, state media said. read more  "The situation is still as is - counterpart to counterpart - but given how the U.S. is in a difficult situation now, they might compromise," said one Riyadh-based diplomat, adding that Prince Mohammed wanted official U.S. recognition and Washington's support in Riyadh's seven-year Yemen campaign.  Asked for comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said: "While energy and security issues are important policy considerations for both countries, we will not discuss the details of our private diplomatic engagements."  "As we have noted publicly, we have held discussions with Saudi Arabia on a collaborative approach to managing potential market pressures stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine."  TRYING TO STAY NEUTRAL  The sources and analysts said Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states could not afford to remain neutral between their Western allies and Russia for long, and would ultimately choose the region's security guarantor America - especially given the risk of secondary sanctions over Ukraine.  But for now, Riyadh and other Gulf oil producers may get away with a neutral stance that allows OPEC+ to continue to function, a senior oil industry source said.  The last time the producers pact unravelled, Riyadh and Moscow became embroiled in a price war and all-out battle for market share that caused oil prices to plummet, ultimately hurting OPEC and U.S. oil producers alike.  Other OPEC producers also say the surge in prices is being driven by geopolitical tension, rather than market fundamentals, and the potential return of Iran to the market if a deal is reached to revive its nuclear agreement needs to be taken into account when determining oil output levels.  "The feedback that we got from the Saudis is that they see the OPEC+ agreement with Russia as a long-term commitment and they are not ready yet to endanger that cooperation ... while making it clear that they stand with the West when it comes to security cooperation," said a Western diplomat in Riyadh.  "They are trying to stay neutral as far as possible, but now that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has gone for a full invasion, they may no longer have that luxury."  WITH US OR AGAINST US  Gulf states also have business and geopolitical interests with Russia, whose president stood by the crown prince when Western leaders shunned him in the uproar over Khashoggi's killing at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.  But it was the West that sent troops to liberate Kuwait in the 1990-1991 Gulf War and defended Riyadh when late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.  And Riyadh and other Gulf states still rely on the American security umbrella even as they move to diversify defence partners due to a perception that U.S. commitment is waning.  "The United States is committed to advancing Saudi defenses," the U.S. State Department spokesperson said. "We also have a robust dialogue on helping Saudi Arabia improve its ability to defend its territory against security threats from Yemen and elsewhere in the region."  Dorsey said the problem for Gulf leaders was that Ukraine could potentially open a Pandora's Box in which major powers either side of the divide invoke former U.S. President George W. Bush's post 9/11 maxim: "You're either with us or against us."  In The Atlantic article, the crown prince hinted that if relations were to sour with Washington, others countries such as China would be more than ready to step in.  "Where is the potential in the world today?" he said. "It's in Saudi Arabia. And if you want to miss it, I believe other people in the East are going to be super happy."

Abu Dhabi has also been pushing Washington to reinstate a terrorism designation on Yemen's Houthi group after it launched attacks on the Gulf Arab state.  "It is like any relationship. It has strong days where the relationship is very healthy and days where the relationship is under question. Today, we’re going through a stress test but I am confident that we will get out of it and get to a better place," Otaiba said in an onstage interview at a defence event.

The United States is a key security ally for Gulf states but Emirati officials have voiced uncertainty about the U.S. commitment to the region and have been building ties with countries like China and Russia and moving to boost UAE defence capabilities as a deterrent to Iran.  The UAE, frustrated by the slow pace of a deal to acquire U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets and conditions related to the sale, said in December it would suspend discussions on it, part of a $23 billion deal that includes drones and other advanced munitions.  Sticking points have been concerns over Abu Dhabi's relationship with China, including the use of Huawei's 5G technology in the country, how the stealth jets can be deployed and how much of the F-35 technology the Emiratis will be able to use. read more  "I think we have a very strong and very clean track record of not only getting the most sensitive American and other Western technology, we also have an incredibly strong track record of protecting that technology. We have had zero incidents where anything has fallen into the wrong hands," Otaiba said.  The UAE already has American-made F-16 fighter jets.  He said the UAE wanted to develop an organic, self-sufficientdefence industry.  "We want countries and companies to come in here and create the industry...We want people to transfer their technologies here. We want people to develop their technologies here."

Pavel Golovkin/Pool via REUTERS  HONG KONG, March 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Russia is destroying what China is trying to build. Having refused to condemn President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and suppressed domestic criticism of Russia, Beijing is alienating many eastern European countries where it is constructing trade, investment and technology relationships under its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.  Ukraine is strategically positioned across rail, road and energy pipelines linking Russia to the rest of Europe. Since it joined President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure policy in 2017, Chinese companies have been upgrading the country’s ports and subways. And in 2020 Kyiv signed a memorandum of understanding with telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, which the United States has been trying to drive out of worldwide networks. With a population of 44 million, Ukraine provides an attractive market for companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810.HK), and it is an important source of agricultural produce. China bought 30% of its corn imports from Ukraine in 2021.  With Russian army convoys advancing toward Kyiv, Beijing is stuck watching missiles wreck a country once receptive to its overtures. The attacks are galvanizing pan-European sentiment against China, which refuses to call Russia’s move an invasion. As the West and Moscow make it harder for private companies to transact, the flow of goods along the “Iron Silk Road,” a rail system across which $75 billion of Chinese products travelled to Europe in 2021, is likely to slow.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Another casualty of war might be China’s relationship with Poland, which has been trying to strike its own balance between Beijing and Washington. Poland is a major rail node on the Belt and Road and hosts Huawei’s regional headquarters. Having experienced tribulations under Russian dominance, it is now being swamped by Ukrainian refugees who blame China for supporting Putin. Former Soviet satellites are aligning more closely with NATO and the European Union, further undermining Beijing’s strategy in the region.  China’s investment in the EU was already cooling. Its M&A deals there dipped to 6.5 billion euros in 2020, a 10-year low. Having miscalculated by openly backing Putin, Beijing is now trying to hedge that position. Unless it can orchestrate peace, however, the diplomatic and commercial damage will be hard to repair.  Follow @petesweeneypro on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo  HONG KONG, March 3 (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to threaten one of China's most discreet but important strategic relationships in recent years: its use of Ukraine as a source of technology for the expanding Chinese military.  Military analysts and diplomats say that although the Ukraine-China link has come under increased pressure from the United States, the current conflict could largely scupper a trade that has helped China's military modernise over the last two decades.  Ukrainian frustration over Beijing's growing ties with Moscow and uncertainty over the shape of its post-war economy and government could threaten the relationship, they say.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "It's always been a good hunting ground for Chinese military technicians. There is a lot there, and it has been in some cases easier to get than getting it from Russia," said Moscow-based Chinese military analyst Vasily Kashin of HSE University.  "The relationship as it was will be completely destroyed," he said, noting Ukrainian government anger at China's diplomatic support for Russia amid other post-war uncertainties.  Beyond the high-profile acquisitions of the partially built hulk of one of the Soviet Union's last aircraft carriers and the airframe of a carrier-capable Su-33 fighter jet, China has purchased engines for its training aircraft, destroyers and tanks as well transport aircraft, according to arms transfers tracked by the independent Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.  Asia-based military attaches say, less visibly, Ukraine has long been suspected to be a source of some command-and-control systems and other technology used in missiles. Ukrainian technicians have worked on a private basis inside China.  This work is expected to continue even if the official relationship sours or becomes difficult, they said.  "One traditional advantage for China in Ukraine is generally the security situation is more fluid than Russia, so it is possible to do things unofficially," one envoy said.  China's Ministry of Defense did not respond to a request for comment.  The SIPRI data does not put a value on every deal it lists, but based on figures provided over the last decade, China has on an annual basis spent at least between $70 million-$80 million.  Long-running programmes include a $317 million-$319 million deal to provide amphibious assault vehicles and $380 million for turbofan engines for Chinese JL-10 combat aircraft trainers, the SIPRI data shows.  Another important deal was the sale of 30 gas turbines for 15 Type-052D destroyers - engines that China is now producing under license and may have also adapted and improved for more modern ships, envoys say.  To be sure, the technology China's military technicians and engineers have acquired has enabled the growth of the country's own indigenous design and manufacturing abilities, making it less reliant on Ukraine than it once was.  "China was very dependent on Ukrainian technology in the 1990s and early 2000s, but that has diminished more and more, particularly as China has developed its own design and manufacturing capabilities," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms transfer researcher with SIPRI.  "There still may be some technology the Chinese are after, particularly aerospace and missile related… and traditionally they (Ukraine) produce quality, it is cutting edge," Wezeman told Reuters.  Russia remains China's most important source of military technology, but Ukraine has provided some items that Moscow can be reluctant or slow to give, reflecting its Soviet-era role as a military shipbuilding and aerospace hub.  SIPRI data shows a significantly larger Russia-China trade, encompassing more advanced turbofan engines for its aircraft, radars and advanced surface-to-air, anti-ship and anti-tank missiles as well as naval guns and transport aircraft.  But a habitually suspicious Moscow has not always provided its latest technology to its large neighbour, the envoys say. As an example, China's rival South China Sea claimant Vietnam was able to obtain far more advanced Kilo diesel electric submarines from Russia over the last decade.  "My guess is that Ukraine for some years filled an important niche for China, in that it might have easier to get certain products and technologies that Russian might have been less keen to sell them," said Singapore-based strategic consultant Alexander Neill. "But China's own indigenous design and manufacturing capacities have improved and to a large extent Ukraine has probably served its purpose."  Any intensifying U.S. involvement in post-war Ukraine could also complicate the trade.  Already, pressure from Washington has had an impact. The Ukrainian government confirmed last year that it would halt the takeover of local aircraft engine maker Motor Sich by Chinese aerospace company Skyrizon due to U.S. concerns of forced technology transfers.

At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires are anchored or cruising in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation, ship tracking data showed. read more  The yachts arrived in the Maldives after the West imposed sanctions on Russia. Washington, the European Union and others have said they will target oligarchs who have amassed fortunes and political influence under Russian President Vladmir Putin.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "Thanks to the French customs officers who are enforcing the European Union's sanctions against those close to the Russian government," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday after French customs seized the 88-metre "Amore Vero" (True Love).  The yacht had been about to flee, he said.  It was impounded in the French Riviera port of La Ciotat and belongs to a company whose main shareholder is Rosneft (ROSN.MM) chief Igor Sechin, a close ally of Putin, the finance ministry said. read more  In Germany, a nearly $600 million luxury yacht owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov was seized in the northern port of Hamburg, Forbes reported. read more  And in another sign of Russian oligarchs feeling the sanctions' heat, billionaire Roman Abramovich said on Wednesday he would sell the Chelsea Football Club and promised to donate money from the sale to help victims of the war in Ukraine. read more  TRACKING ASSETS  The United States is preparing a sanctions package targeting more Russian oligarchs as well as their companies and assets, two sources said on Wednesday, after U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States would work to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians.  The EU, the United States, Canada and Britain are pooling efforts to examine how oligarchs could find ways to bypass the sanctions and also nail down the role of trust companies in holding assets, an EU official said on Thursday.  This task force will aim to close loopholes as they become apparent, the official said.  The impact of the sanctions was being widely felt.  "There is a significant chilling effect on any new business with Russia," said Matt Townsend, a sanctions partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  "People are concerned about credit risk exposure but are also worried about what's coming next. Everyone's eyes are on the next wave of significant sanctions."  READY TO FLEE?  The Amore Vero seized in La Ciotat had arrived there on Jan. 3 and was due to stay until April 1 for repairs, the French finance ministry said.  On Wednesday, customs officers noted that the yacht was "taking steps to sail off urgently, without the repair works being over", the statement said.  As it was subject to the new sanctions, the officers decided to seize it.  Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, did not respond to a request for comment over the seizure.  Monaco-based Imperial Yachts told Reuters the yacht was owned by a firm called Kazimo, which had appointed Imperial Yachts as managers of the boat in 2018.  "The individual you name is not connected with either Kazimo nor the yacht," a representative for Imperial Yachts told Reuters when asked about Sechin. The French finance ministry did not immediately return a request for comment.  Spanish group MB92, which owns the Ciotat shipyard, said the company was cooperating with the French authorities.  In Germany, the 512-foot (156-metre) yacht Dilbar had been undergoing a refit in the shipyards of Blohm + Voss, Forbes said.  The German government had frozen the asset and employees working on the ship did not appear for work on Wednesday, Forbes said.  A representative of Usmanov said he had no confirmation of the yacht's reported seizure. Germany's General Customs office said details of operational measures cannot be made public.  A spokesperson for Blohm + Voss declined to comment on the Dilbar, saying only that all orders and projects of its owners, the Luerssen Group, and subsidiaries were treated in accordance with the legal situation.  MALDIVES HAVEN?  Meanwhile, at least five superyachts owned by Russian billionaires appeared to have found temporary haven in the Maldives, a luxury holiday destination.  The superyacht Clio, owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, was anchored off the capital Male on Wednesday, according to shipping database MarineTraffic.  The Titan, owned by Alexander Abramov, a co-founder of Russian steel producer Evraz, arrived on Monday.  Three more yachts owned by Russian oligarchs were seen cruising in Maldives waters on Wednesday, the data showed. They included the 88-metre (288-foot) Nirvana owned by Russia's richest man, Vladimir Potanin.  Most of the vessels were last seen anchored in Middle Eastern ports. A spokesperson for the Maldives government did not respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw  THE HAGUE, March 3 (Reuters) - Investigators from the International Criminal Court set off for "the Ukraine region" on Thursday to start looking into possible war crimes, the tribunal's top prosecutor said in an interview.  Karim Khan told Reuters his office would see if there was evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide - the offences under the court's jurisdiction - by all parties in the conflict. read more  Asked about reports of artillery strikes in Ukraine's towns and cities, Khan said: "Any side that targets, directly targets, civilians or civilian objects is committing a crime under the Rome Statute and under international humanitarian law," referring to the statue that created the court.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on Feb. 24. read more  Russia denies targeting civilians and says its aim is to "disarm" Ukraine and arrest leaders it falsely calls neo-Nazis.  The International Criminal Court (ICC), which has 123 member states, prosecutes individuals responsible for the worst atrocities when a country is unable or unwilling to do so.  Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC and Moscow does not recognise the tribunal, which opened in The Hague in 2002.  Ukraine signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onwards regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators.  'LAW OF WAR'  "The law of war continues to apply and we have clear jurisdiction," Khan said. "This is a reminder to all factions, to all parties to the conflict, that they must conduct themselves in compliance with the laws of war."  If war crimes are found to have been committed in Ukraine, Khan said, his office would follow the evidence up the chain of command, to the highest levels of political and military office.  "Anybody involved in conflict needs to realise they don't have a licence to commit crimes," he said.  The initial prosecution team dispatched on Thursday was made up of investigators, lawyers, and people with particular experience in operational planning, he added.  Prosecutors have said they will also examine possible crimes in the conflict dating back to Russia’s occupation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and the activities of pro-Russian separatists in Donbass. Khan's office has previously said it had reasonable grounds to believe violations took place in Ukraine. read more  The prosecutor's 2020 annual report based on preliminary investigations cited suspected killings and torture in Crimea and attacks on civilians, torture, murder and rape in eastern Ukraine.

Instead of homes and offices, they were making giant, metal anti-tank barricades known as "hedgehogs", and smaller spiked barriers aimed at stopping wheeled vehicles.  After Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, KAN, a large local property company, reinvented itself to help the defences of the city of 3.4 million people.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Zakhar, a foreman, picked up the phone and started calling the company's construction workers who had remained in Kyiv. Almost everyone volunteered to stay and contribute, he said.  "We build things. We do not know how to fight, but we knew we could be useful," Zakhar said. A few metres away sparks flew as builders cut through and welded together large metal beams.  It is another example of how Ukrainian civilians are supporting regular troops as they try to repel Russia's advance, including through civil defence units and independent militia that have formed across the country.  Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a "special operation" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.  Ukraine's military is dwarfed by that of its powerful neighbour, but resistance in the first week of the conflict has slowed Russia's progress, particularly in urban areas.  Russia has captured one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson - and has bombarded others with increasing intensity, including Kyiv and the country's second city Kharkiv.  A giant column of Russian armour has stalled as it approaches Kyiv from the north, delayed by resistance, mechanical failures and congestion, according to the British defence ministry.  Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the violence and crossed into neighbouring countries. Men of fighting age are prevented from leaving Ukraine.  'WE WILL THROW SPEARS'  On Feb. 25, Kyiv's mayor and boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, said the city "has gone into the defensive phase."  Heavy equipment was brought in to build concrete checkpoints, blocking positions and bunkers inside the city and along all major roads and in the suburbs.  At KAN, workers cut long pieces of girder using blow torches and angle grinders, welding them together into triangular barriers used to bolster fortifications and slow the movement of tanks and tracked armoured personnel carriers.  Oleksandr Bodyuk, the company's deputy director, said workers were also using reinforcing bars and girders salvaged from construction sites to produce spiked, movable defences against wheeled vehicles, including trucks.  So far the makeshift factory, which started operating this week, has produced 110 large hedgehogs, including 40 in the fist 12 hours, Bodyuk said, adding that the company runs other similar sites in the city.  "We have demands from many places for these types of blocking devices, we deliver them wherever they are needed in the area ... subcontractors and friends are providing transportation for the products and the material," he said.  Andriy Kryschenko, Kyiv's deputy mayor who was wearing military fatigues, said many similar firms and workshops had adapted to produce hedgehogs, concrete barriers and other defences.  He added that tens of thousands of people in Kyiv had received weapons and many more were waiting at enlistment and recruitment offices. The city hall was also supporting Territorial Defence units and troops at the frontline, Kryschenko said.  At the construction site, Serhiy Serdyuk, a grizzled welder in his 50s, said workers were ready to take up weapons and join the fight.  "If we have to, when the materials run out, we will make spears and we will throw those spears at them."

REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina  FRANKFURT, March 3 (Reuters) - Regulators are preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB Bank (VTBR.MM), amid growing concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on the bank following the Ukraine invasion, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  VTB Bank's European operations could be closed within days by regulators in Germany, where it chiefly operates on the continent, one person with direct knowledge of the situation said.  The second source said BaFin, the German regulator, was on "high alert", monitoring the situation closely and ready to act if needed although no final decision had been taken.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  VTB, which did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment, said on its European website on Thursday that it was in close consultation with BaFin. It said that the bank was stable and fully operational.  The Russian finance ministry in Moscow and officials at the embassy in Berlin did not respond to requests for comment about VTB's European division.  BaFin declined to comment.  The London Stock Exchange Group's clearing arm LCH said on Thursday it had placed VTB Capital, the trading division of VTB Bank, in default as a clearing member. read more  Last Friday, the exchange had suspended VTB Capital's membership, meaning it could no longer buy and sell stocks listed on the platform.  A spokesperson for the Bundesbank, which shares responsibility for bank supervision, declined to comment on a specific bank when asked about Russian banks in Germany but said it was in close contact with BaFin in this regard. "If necessary, we will take the appropriate measures," the spokesperson added.  Should regulators decide to close VTB in Europe, it would mark the second failure of a major Russian bank in the region as sanctions from the West squeeze the country's lenders. Most of the European operations of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed earlier this week. read more  VTB, which has more than 4 billion euros of deposits in Europe, principally in Germany, would be covered by Berlin's deposit protection scheme, which shields savers with up to 100,000 euros.  BaFin has said that VTB will not take on new customers and that existing account holders were able to access their money.  Supervisors, however, have been monitoring an outflow of deposits since Russia invaded Ukraine, one source familiar with the situation said. The person added that sanctions made it difficult for the bank to recapitalise to meet demands.  VTB has become one of the principal targets of economic sanctions against Moscow in recent days in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. read more  On Wednesday, it was excluded from the SWIFT messaging system underpinning global transactions.  That followed U.S. sanctions last week that effectively kicked the bank out of the U.S. financial system, banned trade with Americans and froze its U.S. assets.  One European Union official, asking not to be named, said VTB was in a similar position to Sberbank because both were sanctioned and had been reputationally damaged in Europe.  VTB had roughly 8 billion euros of assets in Europe, according to its most recent quarterly statements. Its European customers include 600 companies, 150 financial institutions from Russia and 160,000 private customers, according to its website.

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo  SHANGHAI, March 3 (Reuters) - The Moscow branch of a Chinese state bank has seen a surge in enquiries from Russian firms wanting to open new accounts, a person familiar with the matter said, as the country's businesses struggle with international sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine.  "Over the past few days, 200-300 companies have approached us, wanting to open new accounts," the person, who works at the Moscow branch of a Chinese state bank and has direct knowledge of its operations, told Reuters.  He declined to be named or have his bank identified as he is not authorised to speak with media.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It was not clear how widespread Russian demand for new accounts at Chinese banks was, but the banker source told Reuters many of the companies seeking new accounts do business with China and that he expected yuan transactions by such firms to increase.  Western governments are shutting off Russia's economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties and dump tens of billions of dollars' worth of investments. read more  China has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, calling them ineffective and insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia. read more  A handful of Chinese state banks operate in Moscow, including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), Agricultural Bank of China (601288.SS), Bank of China and China Construction Bank (601939.SS).  China Construction Bank declined to comment. The other three Chinese state banks did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.  A Chinese businessman with long-term ties with Russia, who also did not want to be identified, said several Russian companies he works with are now planning to open yuan accounts.  "It's pretty simple logic. If you cannot use U.S. dollars, or euros, and U.S. and Europe stop selling you many products, you have no other options but to turn to China. The trend is inevitable," the source told Reuters.  As a growing number of Western companies abandon Russia, the willingness of emerging market giants such as China to sustain business relations with Moscow highlights a deep rift over Europe's biggest crisis since the World War Two. That trend could threaten to chip away the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. read more  FESCO Transportation Group , a major Russian transport and logistics company, said this week it will accept Chinese yuan from customers, after some Russian banks were kicked out of the global financial messaging system SWIFT. read more  "It's natural for Russian companies to be willing to accept yuan," said Shen Muhui, head of a trade body that promotes links between Russia and China.  But small Chinese exporters are suffering from a tumble in the rouble and many are suspending deliveries to avoid potential losses, he said.  The Russian currency dived to a record low of more than 17 rouble to the yuan on Wednesday , having lost nearly 40% of its value against the Chinese unit over the past week.  "Companies will be switching to yuan-rouble business but in any case things will become two, three or four times more expensive for Russians because the exchange rate between the yuan and rouble is also changing," said Konstantin Popov, a Russian entrepreneur in Shanghai.  Shen said Russian demand for Chinese goods will nevertheless grow in the long term. "The key is to solve trade settlement issues" in the face of sanctions, he said.

With Russian forces intent on advancing towards Kyiv and bombing some other Ukrainian cities into wastelands, the U.N. refugee agency also said the conflict looked set to trigger Europe's largest refugee crisis this century. read more  In the week since President Vladimir Putin ordered the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, most escaping Ukrainians have crossed into the European Union - membership of which their country aspires to - in eastern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary and northern Romania.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Authorities and volunteers across central European border crossings have pitched tents to provide medical aid and process asylum papers and sought to make the entry as smooth as possible for weary Ukrainians harrowing journeys to flee war.  "I've been to Bangladesh. This is as bad as it was (coping with refugees) in Bangladesh," said Morteza Eshghparast, a volunteer for Help Dunya, a German NGO, while waiting in line to re-enter Ukraine at the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest, along its roughly 500-kilometre (310-mile) border with Ukraine.  Volunteers stationed there handed out hot beverages and sandwiches to weary looking refugees, some of whom travelled for days on end to escape the fighting.  Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has around 575,000 Ukrainian refugees so far officials estimate. Nearly 100,000 crossed on Wednesday alone.  'FAMILIES HAD TO BE SEPARATED'  With men of conscription age obliged to stay and help in the defence, mostly women and children have crossed into the European Union from regional crossings.  "We are from Lviv and we decided to flee because we often heard air raid alarms," said Natasha, 23, who fled with her mother in a car and waited two days on the Slovak border. "We took our possessions and fled."  Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.  1/5 A person fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine carries a dog in a backpack to board a train in Zahony, Hungary March 3, 2022.

They had fled from the heavily shelled city of Kharkiv.  "I had to leave my husband behind because he is not allowed to go through the border and I had to leave my parents behind because we have older relatives who they have to look after," Borzenkova said after reuniting with her brother.  "...A lot of families had to be separated."  Across central Europe, where memories of Moscow's dominance after World War Two run deep, thousands of volunteers have converged on the borders, bringing food, clothes and blankets.  Many have opened their homes and hotels or offered vacant apartments to displaced Ukrainians, while a church in Warsaw said it would start celebrating a Sunday mass in Ukrainian and a Polish cinema chain offered a free daily showing for refugee children.  FINDING A PLACE TO SLEEP  In Warsaw, city officials have prioritised finding places to sleep for refugees, saying that 11 trains carrying Ukrainians from the border arrived overnight.  "We're focusing on making sure that hundreds of people aren't forced to stay at the train stations," city council spokeswoman Monika Beuth-Lutyk said. "Organising child care, schools and assistance to find jobs will come later."  Hungary has set up a government working group to provide jobs for Ukrainians as there are close to 80,000 vacancies in Hungary and the shortage is especially serious in construction, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff said on Thursday. read more  Hungarian police data show that around 127,000 entered Hungary from Ukraine since Feb. 24.

Wade decision at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., January 22, 2022. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo  March 3 (Reuters) - Florida's Republican-led Senate on Thursday is expected to pass a bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, putting the state one step closer to adopting a gestational limit currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The state's House of Representatives, which also has a Republican majority, approved the measure last month on a party-line vote. Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, is expected to sign it after Senate approval.  Enactment of the law would significantly reduce access to late-term abortions for women across the U.S. Southeast, many of whom travel hundreds of miles to end pregnancies in Florida because of stricter abortion laws in surrounding states.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The state currently permits abortions up to 24 weeks without a mandatory waiting period, meaning a woman can terminate her pregnancy the day she arrives at a clinic.  Florida's measure, which would take effect on July 1, makes exceptions to the 15-week rule only in cases when the mother is at risk of death or "irreversible physical impairment," or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.  In a session on Wednesday, lawmakers debated an amendment to the bill that would make exceptions for rape, incest and human trafficking, which ultimately failed.  Democratic lawmakers who supported the amendment asked their colleagues to focus on the emotional needs of pregnant victims of sexual assault. "We're better than this," state Senator Victor Torres said.  The bill's sponsor, state Senator Kelli Stargel, defended the bill's exclusion of an exception for rape. She said she rejected the premise that a "child should be killed because of the circumstances in which it was conceived."  Republican lawmakers around the country have introduced bills mirroring a 15-week abortion ban enacted by Mississippi and now being weighed by the Supreme Court after lower courts blocked the measure as unconstitutional. Arizona's Senate and West Virginia's House passed similar 15-week abortion bans last month.  During oral arguments in December, the Supreme Court indicated its willingness to allow Mississippi's law to stand. A ruling in Mississippi's favor would conflict with the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing the right to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, typically around 24 weeks.  Besides seeking reinstatement of its abortion law, the state of Mississippi in Jackson Women's Health Organization v. Dobbs has asked the high court to overturn Roe altogether.  The Supreme Court's ruling is expected this spring.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida said a privacy clause in Florida's constitution that protects against government "intrusion" in residents' private lives would be grounds for a lawsuit challenging a 15-week abortion ban, even as the Supreme Court has not yet decided on the constitutionality of the restriction.  "Because of the explicit right to privacy in our state constitution, Jackson Women's Health Organization v. Dobbs will not dictate what happens with Florida’s cruel 15-week abortion ban," Kara Gross, ACLU Florida's legislative director, said in a statement.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo  WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is seeking $32.5 billion in additional funding from Congress to bolster the U.S. COVID response and help Ukraine, the White House said on Thursday, citing two "urgent and immediate needs."  The $22.5 billion in COVID funding plus $10 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine should be included in Congress' larger spending bill to fund the U.S. government expected to come by March 11, OMB Acting Director Shalanda Young said in a statement.  Previous COVID response bills have enabled Americans to get vaccinated and tested, as well as allowed donations to the world, but nearly all those funds have been used, she said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "We are therefore urging Congress to promptly provide $22.5 billion to cover immediate needs for tests, treatments and vaccines, investments in research and development of next-generation vaccines, and responding globally, including getting more shots in arms around the world," she wrote.  Both Biden's fellow Democrats, who narrowly control Congress, and Republicans strongly support humanitarian and military assistance for Ukraine. Most lawmakers had been expecting only a request of about $7 billion focused on Ukraine, and a request that also includes more than $20 billion for COVID relief could be more difficult to pass, Democratic Representative Adam Smith said on Thursday.  "I just don't know how that's going to sort of rattle the ship," Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said at the American Enterprise Institute.  'IMMEDIATE' NEEDS  The additional Covid resources would allow the government to secure the treatments, vaccines and tests for the coming months and also to fight future variants, Young said. They would also ensure the continuation of free community testing, treatment and vaccination coverage for uninsured individuals.  Young cited "an immediate need" for the aid to help Ukraine and other Central European allies in the wake of the Russian invasion last week. Those funds would help train Ukraine's military, protect its electrical grid, boost its cyberdefenses and enforce sanctions, she wrote.  The White House asked Congress to approve $6.4 billion in aid to address the humanitarian and security crisis in Ukraine the day after Russia invaded on Feb 24. read more Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”  Lawmakers had passed a so-called stopgap spending bill to fund federal agencies through next Friday and must pass another measure by then to avert a government shutdown.  The OMB said the latest funding request may not be the last.  Republicans have balked at additional funds to fight COVID-19. On Wednesday, 36 conservative U.S. senators -- including Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee -- demanded a full accounting of the money authorized so far before considering any more federal funds.  "It is not yet clear why additional funding is needed,” the senators wrote.  Biden secured a $1.9 trillion "American Rescue Plan" last year to fight the pandemic. But the Delta and Omicron variants of the coronavirus helped fuel coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths nationwide. More than 90 percent of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders rose 1.4% in January. Data for December was revised sharply higher to show orders gaining 0.7% instead of falling 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rebound 0.7%.

Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.  Shipments of manufactured goods increased 1.2% in January after rising 0.7% in December. Inventories at factories increased 0.7%. Unfilled orders rose 0.9% after advancing 0.8% in the prior month.

The upbeat reports on Thursday bode well for February's employment report on Friday. Economists are anticipating another month of solid job growth, with the Omicron COVID-19 variant wave of infections significantly diminished.  "Jobless claims at a new low since Omicron are a signal of a stronger employment report tomorrow where the labor market is leaving its pandemic woes behind it," said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 26, the lowest level since Jan. 1, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 applications for the latest week.  The second straight weekly decline in claims pulled them further away from the 290,000 level in mid-January.  Unadjusted claims dropped 21,285 to 194,693 last week, led by big declines in California and Michigan, which offset a jump in filings in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  With a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December, companies are holding on to their workers.  Claims could soon fall back below 200,000. They were last below this level in early December.  Claims have dropped from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid edged up 2,000 to 1.476 million during the week ended Feb. 19. Tight labor market conditions are fueling wage growth, which is adding to inflation pressures.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that "the labor market is extremely tight."  Powell said he would support a 25-basis-point interest rate hike at the U.S. central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting and would be "prepared to move more aggressively" if inflation does not abate as fast as expected. read more  U.S. stocks opened higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.  LAYOFFS TUMBLE  Though Russia's war against Ukraine poses a risk to the labor market through disruptions of supply chains, economists expect the labor market will recoup all the jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic this year. Prices of oil, wheat and other commodities have soared, which will further stoke inflation.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in February after rising 467,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.9% from 4.0% in January.  Expectations for a strong employment report were bolstered by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing U.S.-based employers announced 15,245 job cuts in February, down 20% from January. Layoffs dropped 56% compared to a year ago.  Companies also announced plans to hire 215,127 workers last month, the largest February total since Challenger began tracking monthly hiring figures in 2002. That compared to the 77,630 jobs announced in January.  "The latest numbers give more evidence that job creation is strong, and employers continue to hold fast to their workforces," said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The churn in the labor market is coming from resignations."  The increase in planned hiring was led by retailers, with 114,118 jobs announced. Companies in the entertainment/leisure industry planned to add 22,369 jobs to payrolls. The government sector announced plans to hire 17,266 workers. Employers in the automotive industries planned to increase employment by 14,486.

Stephanie Lecocq/Pool via REUTERS  BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - The European Union is waiting to see the impact of a slew of sanctions on Russia before imposing any more, but it is working on further steps that could include targeting crypto-assets, officials said on Thursday.  The president of the EU's executive said the bloc would take additional steps against Moscow if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorates further following Russia's invasion of the country last week.  "Our aim is to cut the Kremlin's capacity to wage war on its neighbours," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after a meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The 27-member bloc has approved an array of financial, energy, export and travel bans since last week.  These have included a freeze on Russian central bank assets, the shutdown of EU airspace to Russia, the removal of a number of Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, and sanctions on a clutch of Russian tycoons.  "We still have many ideas how we can take work forward when it comes to sanctions, whether it's on trade, whether it's on energy, whether it's on exports, on .... shipping," said one EU official on condition of anonymity.  "So it is being worked on as we speak. But I think the spirit now ... is that we see the implementation and the effect of what we have done so far."  A second EU official said that while the bloc waits for its sanctions "to bite" there is analysis under way on how to target Russian crypto assets and work on how to "make sure that Belarus can't be used as a loophole" by Russians to sidestep sanctions.  The officials said Russia appeared to have been surprised by the intensity of EU sanctions and counter-measures have come with a time lag, though it has reciprocally closed its airspace to countries that have banned Russian airlines.  The EU has stopped short of curbing energy imports from Russia, which provides more than a third of Europe's gas imports and more than a quarter of its oil imports, but is looking for alternative supplies in case of Russian retaliation and trying to diversify its energy-use mix.  "We need to get independent from Russian gas, oil and coal," von der Leyen said. "Our resolve to go forward in this case is stronger than ever."

Macron, who has led European efforts to avert war by visiting Putin in Moscow last month and mediating over the phone between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Russian leader, squarely put the blame of hostilities on the Kremlin.  "It is alone, betraying his international commitments one by one, that President Putin chose war," Macron said in a nationwide address to the French people, hailing Zelenskiy as the face of "honour, freedom and courage".  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "This war is not a conflict between the West and Russia, as some would like us to believe. There is no NATO base in Ukraine. These are lies. Russia is not aggressed, it is the aggressor. This war is not a fight against Nazism ... it's a lie," Macron added.  Russia says it is conducting a "special military operation", aimed at disarming Ukraine and capturing "neo-Nazis" Putin says are running the country.  Macron, who was speaking less than two months before a presidential election in which he is still to declare his candidacy, said he would continue to defend France's values and standing in the world.  French President Emmanuel Macron appears on a screen as he delivers a speech on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in Paris, France, March 2, 2022. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw  The rise in energy prices will inevitably have an impact on the French economy, he warned.  "Tomorrow, the price of filling the tank, the amount on heating bills, the cost of some products is likely to be even heavier," he said.  But the cost will not only be born over the short term, Macron said, adding that the war in Ukraine marked a new era, in which war in Europe was a reality.  "War in Europe does not only belong to history books any more, it's here. Democracy is no longer unquestioned, it is being challenged under our eyes," Macron said.  Macron also said that beyond his domestic plans of making France less reliant on foreign energy source by building new nuclear plants, he said he would push at the European level for the EU to cut its dependence on Russian gas.  "The war in Ukraine marks a break for our continent and our generation," he said.

AAP Image/Jason O'Brien via REUTERS  SYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - Authorities in Australia issued more orders for people to leave their homes on Thursday after heavy rain triggered flash floods in its largest city, with officials warning of worse to come and some 500,000 people likely to face orders to evacuate.  Australia's east coast has been battered by a severe weather system that has cut off entire towns and submerged hundreds of homes and farms as it has moved south from Queensland state over the past week.  Thirteen people have been killed since the deluge began a week ago.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "We do believe that things will get worse before they get better in the state," New South Wales state Premier Dominic Perrottet told reporters, adding that some half a million people would be affected by evacuation orders and warnings.  Perrottet said the floods would likely be worse in some places than floods last year, which were the worst in 60 years.  The second year of flooding comes as the La Nina weather pattern, typically associated with increased rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast over the summer. Rivers and catchments were already near capacity before the latest drenching after steady rains over the last few weeks.  Authorities said not as much water was expected to overflow from the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's major water supply, as earlier feared as rains slightly eased.  Some Sydney suburbs got more than 100 mm (4 inches) of rain over the past 24 hours and the weather bureau said more was on the way with some places to get up to 150 mm on Thursday.  March's mean rainfall in Sydney, home to more than 5 million people, is around 140 mm.  Satellite images showed the storm drifting away from Sydney but several suburbs in the city's west are still battling rising waters. Tens of thousands of residents were ordered to evacuate in the middle of the night on Wednesday. read more  In Lismore, the north New South Wales town worst hit by the floods, business owners began taking stock of the damage as waters receded.  "We are shattered and my heart is aching. Not sure when roads will be clear ... what a week!," the owner of a cloth store wrote in a Facebook post and posted pictures of a pile of debris in her flood-hit store.  Heavy rainfall and wild winds, meanwhile, returned to southeast Queensland, already devastated by record flooding in recent days, hampering relief efforts with the weather bureau predicting "incredibly intense rain" there on Thursday.  "Conditions are going to be unstable for the next 24 to 48 hours," Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters. "I haven't seen storms and floods like this, all being thrown at us at once."

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo  WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday took aim at Russia's oil refining sector with new export curbs and targeted Belarus with sweeping new export restrictions, as the Biden administration amps up its crackdown on Moscow and Minsk over the invasion of Ukraine.  The new round of sanctions announced by the White House ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it harder for Russia to modernize its oil refineries.  The White House also applied a sweeping set of export restrictions levied against Russia last month to Belarus, arguing the controls would help prevent the diversion of items, including technology and software, in the defense, aerospace, and maritime sectors to Russia through Belarus.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "The United States will take actions to hold Belarus accountable for enabling Putin's invasion of Ukraine, weaken the Russian defense sector and its military power for years to come, target Russia’s most important sources of wealth, and ban Russian airlines from U.S. airspace," the White House said.  The European Union also approved new sanctions against Belarus for its supporting role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, effectively banning about 70% of all imports from that country, the EU said on Wednesday. read more  The United States has steadily increased sanctions on Moscow after Putin began the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Belarus has allowed Russian troops to use its territory as a staging ground for the assault.  The Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export controls, also said it was adding to a trade blacklist entities with ties to the Russian and Belarusian military and defense sectors, making it much harder for them to receive U.S. technology imports.  In a detailed filing about the new restrictions on Belarus, the United States said it would allow mobile phone and software sales to consumers in Belarus, but not to President Alexander Lukashenko, his intelligence staff, the Belarusian military, as well as members of state media and other government officials.  The U.S. State Department will also impose sanctions targeting 22 Russian defense-related entities, including firms that make combat aircraft and missiles for the country's military, to "further restrict Putin's war machine," the White House said.  Details of the measures and the targets of sanctions were not immediately available.  BLOWS TO ENERGY SUPPLY  With the exception of some measures targeting Russian state gas company Gazprom , the Biden administration has largely held back from sanctions against Russia's energy sector, concerned that such measures could raise already high energy prices.  Oil marched relentlessly higher beyond $110 a barrel on Wednesday, responding to a flood of divestment from Russian oil assets by major companies and expectations that the market will remain short of supply for months to come.  "The United States and our allies and partners do not have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy – which is why we have carved out energy payments from our financial sanctions," The White House said.  "But we and our allies and partners share a strong interest in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier over time."  Russia exports between 2 million and 3 million barrels of refined products daily, making it one of the world's largest exporters of fuels. The country has about 5.5 million barrels of crude refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Department, citing Oil & Gas Journal figures.  Russia's invasion has yet to achieve its aim of overthrowing Ukraine's government but has sent more than 870,000 people fleeing to neighboring countries and jolted the global economy as governments and companies line up to isolate Moscow. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Alexandra Alper and Doina Chiacu; Additional Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Stephen Coates  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered sweeping Western sanctions that threaten to disrupt commodity flows, raising the spectre of gas shortages, blackouts and further price increases.  Italy is particularly exposed. It uses gas to generate 40% of its electricity and imports account for more than 90% of its gas needs. Russia has been its largest supplier and Prime Minister Mario Draghi wants to reduce that reliance. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  It is now scrambling to boost flows from Algeria, Libya and Azerbaijan to meet demand and fill storage before next winter.  With one of Europe's biggest gas transport networks, Italy is seen as a future bridgehead into Europe for gas - and green hydrogen - produced in North Africa and beyond. read more  The Transmed pipeline has been pumping Algerian gas to Italy since 1983. It has a daily capacity of more than 110 million cubic metres (mcm) but currently transports under 60 mcm.  "There’s plenty of room in the pipeline but the problem is there's no new gas to fill it because of chronic underinvestment in the industry in recent years,” says Davide Tabarelli, head of energy think tank Nomisma Energia.  Algeria, which also has pipelines to Spain and a large liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Skikda, boosted oil and gas output last year by 5% to around 185 million tons of oil equivalent. LNG output rose 14%.  But rising domestic consumption and political instability, including the closure of a pipeline to Spain over a dispute with Morocco, have capped Algerian exports.  "Algeria has a lot of gas and it's easy to get out of the ground but it will take years to get it on line," says Tabarelli.  TAP ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS  Algeria's gas exports to Italy climbed last year, jumping 76% to 21 billion cubic metres - 28% of overall consumption and second behind the 29 bcm from top supplier Russia.  Italy's foreign minister said a visit this week to Algeria with the head of energy group Eni to seek an increase in gas supplies had yielded good results. read more  Eni, which holds long-term gas contracts with state-owned energy giant Sonatrach, last year signed a series of accords aimed at increasing production in the country.  Eni also has gas assets in Libya and co-owns the Green Stream pipeline which currently pumps around 7% of imports. But conflict in the country has made ramping up production hard.  Italy is also counting on getting more gas from Azerbajan through the Trans-Adriatic pipeline (TAP) that only started pumping last year after years of bitter local opposition.  Prime Minister Draghi said Italy needed to think about possibly doubling TAP capacity.  TAP, the final leg of a $40 billion project named the Southern Gas Corridor, last year brought more than 8 bcm of Azeri gas into Europe with around 6 bcm ending up in Italy. This year capacity is expected at 10 bcm.  The project consortium, which includes gas transport group Snam (SRG.MI), is in talks that could pave the way to double capacity though TAP management says it would take more than 50 months to upgrade infrastructure.  But Azerbaijan's ability to produce and export more fuel is limited.  "They can build compressor stations for the pipeline but Azerbaijan can't just double production overnight - that requires time and money," said Paolo Ghislandi, secretary general of Italy's energy trader and supplier association AIGET.  RISING COSTS  On Thursday climate change think tank ECCO said Italy could manage a Russian gas outage over the next year through energy efficiency measures, faster renewables rollout and leveraging existing gas infrastructure.  It said "non-Russian" pipelines from Algeria, Libya and Northern Europe were largely underused with an aggregate annual transport capacity of more than 100 bcm.  Calls from Draghi for Italy to build more LNG terminals will also require investments - but above all time.  Italy’s byzantine permitting process, a brake on renewables rollout, has virtually stopped development of LNG facilities beyond the three plants currently operative and which now account for 23% of daily imports.  "It's a cataclysm with consumers already looking at price rises almost 50% from just a week or so ago," says Tabarelli. "There's just not enough gas to replace Russia."

REUTERS/Stephen Lam/  March 3 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) is expanding its crowdsourced fact-checking program by making notes on potentially misleading tweets visible to more people on Twitter, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.  The social networking site launched the project called Birdwatch last year as a novel experiment that asked Twitter users to identify misleading tweets and write notes to provide information debunking the content, which would then be appended to the original tweet.  Like other social media platforms, Twitter has long been under pressure to do more to prevent false content from spreading among its 217 million daily users.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The notes written by the 10,000 contributors in the Birdwatch pilot program have been kept on a separate website.  Now, a small group of randomized users on Twitter in the United States will be able to see Birdwatch notes directly on tweets and can rate the helpfulness of the information, Twitter said.  Over time, Twitter said it aims to expand Birdwatch to additional users in more countries.  Some Birdwatch notes on Thursday addressed misleading content related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.  A tweet on Feb. 26, which had been retweeted more than 17,000 times, showed an image of British rockstar Paul McCartney waiving a Ukrainian flag while on stage in front of a crowd.  A note appended to the tweet on the Birdwatch site said the photo was taken in 2008 when McCartney performed at an "Independence Concert" in Kyiv.

REUTERS/Maksim Levin  LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine will unveil plans for NFTs to support its armed forces, its vice-prime minister said on Thursday, the latest move in Kyiv's efforts to raise funds in crypto assets after Russia invaded the country last week.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a kind of crypto asset which represents a digital file such as an image, video or text.

Fedorov, also Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, has spearheaded Kyiv's push to raise funds in cryptoassets.

Belarus has been a key staging area for the full-scale invasion Russia launched on Ukraine a week ago.  Thursday's decision comes a day after the IPC gave athletes from the two countries the green light to participate in the March 4-13 Games as neutrals, saying the "athletes were not the aggressors". read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But that led to an outcry and threats from other countries' National Paralympic Committees (NPC) to boycott the Games, IPC President Andrew Parsons told a news conference in Beijing.  "They told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences for the Winter Games," Parsons said.  "Multiple NPCs, some of which have been contacted by their governments, teams and athletes, are threatening not to compete."  Russian news agency TASS reported Russia is drafting a lawsuit with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against IPC's decision.  "We are currently in work to establish our legal position to file lawsuits on the protection of our athletes' rights, against the discrimination of athletes based on their ethnicity and the use of sports as a tool of a political pressure," TASS quoted Russian sports minister Oleg Matytsin as saying.  "Today's decision... to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes' rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives' values in pursuit of political goals," he added.  Ukraine's paralympic committee welcomed the decision and thanked the sporting community for rallying around them.  "A fair decision, a decision against a country that started this war," committee president Valeriy Sushkevych told a news conference.  A 71-member Russian contingent and 12-member team from Belarus are in Beijing.  "Now Russia must leave the Games as soon as possible ... It's time to stop this terrible war," Sushkevych said.  Officials from the two banned teams were not immediately available for comment.

IPC President Andrew Parsons during a press conference ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympic Games, following the IPC Governing Board decision in regards to Russian and Belarusian athletes competing during the Ukraine Crisis. Thomas Lovelock/OIS/Handout via REUTERS  Parsons said it was clear the situation put his organisation in a "unique and impossible position" so close to the start of the Games, adding that an overwhelming number of members had been in touch to object to Russia and Belarus taking part.  Parsons said the Russian and Belarusian athletes were victims of the actions of their governments.  "If Russian and Belarusian athletes stayed in Beijing, nations were likely to withdraw, and a viable Games would not have been possible.  "The atmosphere in the Games village is not pleasant. The situation there is escalating and has now become untenable ... The Games are not only about gold, silver and bronze, but also about sending a strong message of inclusion."  Parsons said the IPC was likely to face legal consequences but was confident that the right decision had been made.  The IPC said earlier in a statement that following a specially convened meeting, its Governing Board has decided not to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part.  RUSSIA CONDEMNS IPC, OTHER NATIONS WELCOME DECISION  Russia condemned the IPC for barring its athletes from the Winter Games, calling it a monstrous situation. read more  "This is a disgrace for the International Paralympic Committee," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.  IPC's decision was supported by the paralympic committees of Britain, Iceland, Canada and New Zealand.  The Polish Paralympic Committee said it would have been unimaginable for athletes from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus to compete in the same place.  The German Paralympic Committee president Julius Beucher said the IPC had followed the desire of the majority of the national committees and the athletes, who "exerted great pressure" to reverse the initial decision.  "This is a strong sign of democracy within the Paralympic movement," Beucher said.  Czech Paralympic Committee chairman Zbynek Sykora said: "Athletes should have the opportunity to show their best performances at the top event, but in this case we take the elimination of Russia and Belarus as another opportunity to put pressure on Russian President (Vladimir) Putin."

REUTERS/Costas Baltas  March 2 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has not made a commitment to lift sanctions on Russia in case of a ceasefire or peace deal following its invasion of Ukraine, IOC President Thomas Bach said on Wednesday.  The IOC said on Monday it was recommending that sports organisations do not allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions.  The announcement led to a host of sports announcing such sanctions, including FIFA and UEFA which suspended Russian national teams and clubs from international football.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Asked if the IOC had made any commitment to lift the sanctions in the event of a ceasefire or peace deal, Bach said that, after long deliberation, the organisation had opted against such an approach.  "We have left this open... it was very difficult either to set a deadline or to define an event, what could either lead to heavier sanctions or what could lead to a lifting of some of the sanctions," Bach told reporters.  "This is why you find in general terms the formula that we are keeping to closely monitor the situation and will adapt depending on the further developments," he added.  Bach said no sanctions had been taken directly against the Russian Olympic Committee because it was not responsible for the invasion.  "You can only hold those responsible who are responsible for a breach of the Olympic Charter. And not the Russian people, nor the athletes, nor the Russian Olympic Committee is responsible for this," he said.  Bach said he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion, that Putin has called "a special military operation", adding that he had not been on speaking terms with him "for a number of years".  Sports organisations have been cutting commercial ties with Russian companies, including UEFA cancelling its sponsorship deal with energy firm Gazprom.  The German said the IOC had no deals with firms from Russia, but that Russian and Belarusian territories had been removed from the European tender for Olympic broadcast rights which was launched last week.  Belarus has been a key staging area for the invasion of Ukraine.  Bach had made an appeal to "give peace a chance" at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics last month but said the events of the past week had left him horrified.  "Sometimes you wish you could do more and this was the wish I expressed in the in the closing ceremony... then you see that all the efforts were for nothing, that this inspiration was not was not strong enough and then it's horrifying. It's really horrifying," he said.  The Olympic chief repeated his support for athletes speaking out for peace, but said there was little the IOC could do to protect Russian athletes who might face repercussions for such views.  "Again, we are coming to our limits. We have no police force, we have no military. There we can only offer moral support and can help to shed the light on this situation, but there our influence ends," he said.  "We can argue as we did in other humanitarian cases affecting athletes, by trying to intervene and to again, to shed light, to ask for exceptions or to call for mildness, but this is all we can do, we can only appeal," he said.

Rangers 5, Blues 3  Chris Kreider scored the tiebreaking power-play goal with 8:20 remaining as New York prevailed after blowing a two-goal lead against visiting St. Louis.

Amid growing calls for Abramovich to be hit by sanctions after Russia's invasion of its neighbour, the metals magnate said in a statement that a sale was in the best interests of the reigning European and world soccer champions.  "In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club's sponsors and partners," he said.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Abramovich said he would not ask for loans he has made to the Premier League club - reported to total 1.5 billion pounds ($2.0 billion) - to be repaid to him and the sale would not be fast-tracked.  He has told his aides to set up a charitable foundation which would receive all net proceeds from the sale.  "The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine," Abramovich said in a statement.  "This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery."  Swiss business tycoon Hansjoerg Wyss told a newspaper that he was considering buying Chelsea from Abramovich who over the weekend said he was stepping back from running the club but made no mention of any plans to change its ownership.  "Abramovich is currently trying to sell all his villas in England. He also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly now. I, along with three other people, received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich," Blick quoted Wyss as saying in an interview published on Wednesday. read more  TROPHY HAUL  Abramovich bought the West London club in 2003 for a reported 140 million pounds and his investment contributed hugely to the most successful era in the team's history as they won five Premier League titles, five FA Cups and the Champions League twice.  His purchase of the club helped transform the landscape of English football with Chelsea breaking the stranglehold of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.  They beat Brazilian side Palmeiras last month to become FIFA Club World Cup champions for the first time, having defeated Manchester City to become European champions last season.  "A seismic moment" was how BBC presenter and former England striker Gary Lineker described the announcement ahead of coverage of Chelsea's FA Cup fifth-round tie at Luton Town.  Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich walks past the High Court in London November 16, 2011. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo  Chelsea fans at Kenilworth Road chanted the Russian's name before kickoff.  The 55-year-old, who has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, became one of Russia's most powerful businessmen by earning fabulous fortunes after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes has put his net worth at $13.3 billion.  Since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Britain has imposed sanctions on 12 members of the Russian and Belarusian elite, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and at least 12 banks and companies.  British opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday why there had not been sanctions against the Chelsea owner. Johnson, speaking in parliament, said he could not go into details on specific cases.  But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that she has drawn up a "hit list" of Russian oligarchs, and said the government would impose new sanctions on them every few weeks.  The Financial Times said the government was also making plans to seize property owned by Russian oligarchs. read more  David Davis, a veteran lawmaker in Johnson's ruling Conservative Party, said the sale should be blocked however until Abramovich can prove the source of his wealth.  "We should do everything to prevent him selling off his UK assets," Davis said on Twitter  Abramovich said the decision to sell had been incredibly difficult.  "I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person," he said.  Abramovich turned his back on life in London in 2018 when the British government delayed renewing his visa following the attempted assassination of a former Russian double-agent in England, which it blamed on Moscow.  "It has been a privilege of a lifetime to be part of Chelsea FC and I am proud of all our joint achievements," he said.  "Chelsea Football Club and its supporters will always be in my heart."

Olena Wang, who is married to a Hong Konger, runs the restaurant Ivan the Kozak together with her daughter. They employ seven people, including Ukrainians and Russians.  Wang says many in Hong Kong have asked how they can help Ukraine in the past week after Russia invaded. As the requests were too many to handle individually, the restaurant began posting online about how people could contribute.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  One customer handed over a tip of over HK$10,000 ($1,280) and asked the restaurant to wire the money to those in need. Wang also provides recommendations for people who wish to donate directly to aid groups, including the Red Cross, hospitals and volunteers helping the Ukrainian army.  "We sent this money to Ukraine and sent an email confirmation to him so he knows we sent the money to the right place," Wang told Reuters, encouraging others to donate. "I want to scream, I want to share my pain with everyone."  Wang could not estimate how much Hong Kongers have donated. The Ukrainian Society of Hong Kong, an independent network for the Ukrainian community in the city, which also facilitates donations, estimates most people donate HK$1,000 to HK$3,000, but could not estimate total donations.  Ivan the Kozak has operated for 21 years in Hong Kong, offering regional specialities from across Ukraine, as well as teas and vodkas from other countries in Eastern Europe.  As a Ukrainian, Wang said, she has no personal hatred for Russians and only wants peace. There is no animosity among the staff, she added, and Russians living in Hong Kong are lucky because they can have a full picture of the news, unlike those only seeing propaganda at home.  Wang said she had been touched by the "bravery" and "determination" of civil society in Ukraine in the face of war.  Her elderly parents live in a suburb 20km from the Kyiv city centre, and Wang says they are too old and frail to go to bomb shelters, which makes her anxious and angry at the Russian government.  "We don’t want to be a vassal for someone," Wang said. “We want to be free. We want our children to have a future. We can fight, we can die for this.”  ($1 = 7.8142 Hong Kong dollars)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Reporting by Aleksander Solum; Editing by Marius Zaharia and Gerry Doyle  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Scottish indie rockers Franz Ferdinand said they were pulling Russian gigs scheduled for the summer, adding "the only reason for this is the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian state."

This great country has inspired our band through its art and literature and since we first played there seventeen years ago, we have built a rich and deep relationship with our Russian fans," the band said.

"We have spoken to many of our friends in Russia via social media and have encountered unanimous opposition to this violence and solidarity with our Ukrainian friends," the band said.  "We know you see the madness of your country’s leadership. We know you do not want war. We do not want war."  Tomlinson, a former member of boy band One Direction, said late on Monday that he was cancelling tour shows in Moscow and Kyiv.  "The safety of my fans is my priority and my thoughts go out to the people of Ukraine and all those suffering from this needless war," he wrote on Twitter.  Announcing he had cancelled his Russia shows, Yungblud said he was "heartbroken" to do so over Moscow's assault on its neighbour, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.  "Everyone deserves to be the creator of their own destiny, rather than having it forced upon them by acts of war and aggression," he wrote on Twitter.  Other acts to pull Russian gigs in the last few days include U.S. rock bands Green Day and Health and indie pop trio AJR.  "Though we do not wish to penalise our fans for governmental decisions that are beyond their control, given the current state of affairs we will no longer be performing our previously scheduled shows in St Petersburg and Moscow," Health wrote on Twitter on Monday.

Winning the top SAG honor often, but not always, precedes a best picture win.  This year's Oscar winners will be announced on March 27.  The war in Ukraine did not go unnoticed, with actor Leslie Odom Jr. acknowledging the violence at the onset of the ceremony, sending "our thoughts, prayers and hopes for impending peace." It was a recurring theme throughout the night.

"The Power of the Dog," which led Oscar nominations with 12 nods, was not nominated by SAG for best cast. The gothic Western did not win on Sunday.  Jessica Chastain won best movie actress for "The Eyes of Tammy Faye," and Will Smith was named best movie actor for "King Richard."  Among the night's television honors, the fish out of water series about an American football coach hired to coach a British soccer team, "Ted Lasso," won for best comedy, and the cast of HBO's tale of money, power and politics, "Succession" won for outstanding ensemble performance in a drama series.  "Succession's" Brian Cox used his acceptance speech to address the war, lauding the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comic, and offering support for Russian actors, who "under pains of high treason" cannot speak out.  Helen Mirren was honored with a lifetime achievement award.  "I joined our tribe of rogues and vagabonds a long time ago," said Mirren. "And it is you, you actors, that I want to thank."

The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said Monday it is pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, starting with the upcoming Pixar Animation Studios release, "Turning Red." Within hours, WarnerMedia said it would pause this week's release of "The Batman" in Russia.  "We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation," Disney said in a statement. "In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance."

Gergiev - general director of the St. Petersburg Mariinsky Theatre and regarded as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin - conducted "The Queen of Spades", an opera based on Alexander Pushkin's novel, at La Scala on Feb. 23.  The show will run ‪until March 15 and the next performance is scheduled for Saturday.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "I don't think he will be there, I think at this point we can rule it out," Giuseppe Sala, La Scala theatre board chairman and mayor of Milan, told reporters on Monday.  "The maestro did not reply to us," he added, referring to requests for Gergiev to comment on the Ukraine crisis.  The Mariinsky Theatre did not respond to a request for comment.  The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra also said it was suspending its work with Gergiev, who is an honorary conductor in the Dutch city, and would cancel a Gergiev Festival planned for September unless he distances himself from Putin's actions.  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter last week gave Gergiev a deadline of Monday to speak out or be removed as principal conductor of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.  The Moscow-born Gergiev, 68, has performed in the most famous theatres around the world. In 2013, Putin awarded him the first title of Hero of Labour of Russia.  But those ties have rebounded on him as Western nations react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest assault on a European nation since World War Two.  Gergiev had been due to conduct three concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall leading the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra from Feb. 25-27.  But the Russian conductor has been replaced by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, according to the theatre's website.  Separately, the Venice La Biennale art exhibition said the curator and artists of the Pavilion of the Russian Federation had pulled out of the event in protest at the war in Ukraine.  "La Biennale expresses its complete solidarity for this noble act of courage," it said in a statement.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon  TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Sega Sammy Holdings Inc (6460.T) is hoping to ride the fast-moving coattails of Sonic the Hedgehog as the character enjoys a renaissance amid a global scramble for entertainment content.  This year sees the release of a sequel to a record-breaking Hollywood movie and a Netflix series, along with a title that Sega hopes will revive the fortunes of the long-running Sonic game franchise after decades of malaise.  "Sonic is the face of Sega. If Sonic is doing well, then Sega is doing well to an extent, too," Shuji Utsumi, co-chief operation officer of Sega, told Reuters in an interview.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The blue blur became a household name in the West in a series of side-scrolling games in the 1990s on the Sega Mega Drive console, also known as the Sega Genesis in North America, which outsold Nintendo's Super NES in many countries.  "Sonic was cool with humour and an attitude... that resonated in the West," said Utsumi, who worked at Sony when it launched the first PlayStation.  Unlike Nintendo's Mario, who starred in decades of acclaimed titles, Sonic struggled to make the transition to 3D games as Sega withdrew from the console business to become a game publisher.  Now, after years of trial and error during which Sega merged with pachinko gambling machine maker Sammy, Sonic revived his career as a movie star as studios raided corporate larders for underused characters with mass appeal.  Sonic-related sales, including from the movie, have quadrupled in the five years to the financial year that ended March 2021.  The game series has a committed, and long-suffering, fanbase in the West, in contrast with other Sega franchises such as "Yakuza" and "Persona", which have a large audience in Japan.  "It's definitely a nostalgic love for him," said Jacob Mills, 31, a British game level designer, referring to the hedgehog. Mills plays new Sonic releases and describes his enthusiasm as "a shared experience of mutual disappointment."  Initial prospects for the first Sonic movie from Paramount, which featured Jim Carrey, seemed in doubt when a trailer showing the character with prominent white teeth was derided on social media.  The studio tweaked the design, and the movie eventually raked in more than $300 million worldwide - becoming one of the best grossing video game adaptations - after its release in 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.  "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" will be released in April. The franchise's importance to Paramount was underscored in an investor presentation earlier this month outlining the future of the company and announcing a second Sonic sequel along with a hybrid animated/live-action series about the Knuckles character for its streaming service. A separate animated series is due to launch on Netflix this year.  "It's another big franchise for us and for Sega," Paramount Pictures chief Brian Robbins told Reuters. The Sonic investment is part of a broader commitment to franchises spanning movies and series, Paramount Chief Executive Bob Bakish said during the presentation. Shares fell on scepticism over whether the content could compete in an increasingly crowded streaming market.  OPEN WORLD  Sega has embraced the Sonic community, in 2017 releasing Sonic Mania, a widely praised retro platformer that began life as a fan-made game before being backed by firm.  An artist from the game later worked for Paramount on the Sonic movie, and Sega interacts humorously with fans on via the Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which has 5.8 million followers.  Expectations are growing for "Sonic Frontiers", an open world platformer due for release this year. The format is novel for the franchise, whose other games have been bought or downloaded 1.38 billion times.  Sega has not shown any gameplay for the title, which was delayed for a year, and wary fans point to the "Sonic cycle", in which excitement and talk of a comeback in the build-up to a new release is dashed by disappointment on playing the game.  The earnings impact of Sonic-related output "is going to be tangible" in the financial year starting in April, Utsumi said, without providing further details.  This month, the company upgraded its full year operating profit forecast by a third to 31 billion yen ($268 million). The gaming unit has been boosted by sales of titles such as role-playing game "Shin Megami Tensei V" for the Nintendo Switch.  Utsumi, who returned to Sega two years ago after founding his own gaming company and working at Disney and Warner Music, says the company is a "treasure island" of content that could be further commercialized.  Other Japanese characters joining the rush include a forthcoming Super Mario movie from "Minions" studio Illumination and Netflix's live action remake of cult 1990s anime Cowboy BeBop released last year.  Sega has a close relationship with Xbox maker Microsoft and in November said it was exploring an alliance to develop titles using the Redmond, Washington-based firm's cloud technology.  Longer term, Sega aims to create a "super game" with global appeal - that perhaps will be part of the "metaverse", a buzzy term for a network of persistent simulated online environments.  Sega, whose shares have rise by 16% year-to-date, has long experience across arcade and console gaming and different genres, Utsumi said.  "There's no one better suited to do this than us," he said.

Internal records examined by Reuters reveal that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely feed chickens an array of antibiotics – not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives.  In every instance of antibiotic use identified by Reuters, the doses were at the low levels that scientists say are especially conducive to the growth of so-called superbugs, bacteria that gain resistance to conventional medicines used to treat people. Some of the antibiotics belong to categories considered medically important to humans.  The internal documents contain details on how five major companies - Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue Farms, George’s and Koch Foods - medicate some of their flocks.  The documented evidence of routine use of antibiotics for long durations was “astonishing,” said Donald Kennedy, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.  Kennedy, president emeritus of Stanford University, said such widespread use of the drugs for extended periods can create a “systematic source of antibiotic resistance” in bacteria, the risks of which are not fully understood. “This could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought,” Kennedy said.  Reuters reviewed more than 320 documents generated by six major poultry companies during the past two years. Called “feed tickets,” the documents are issued to chicken growers by the mills that make feed to poultry companies’ specifications. They list the names and grams per ton of each “active drug ingredient” in a batch of feed. They disclose the FDA-approved purpose of each medication. And they specify which stage in a chicken’s roughly six-week life the feed is meant for.  The feed tickets examined represent a fraction of the tens of thousands issued annually to poultry farms run by or for major producers. The confidential information they contain nonetheless extends well beyond what the U.S. government knows. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal and has been rising for decades. But U.S. regulators don’t monitor how the drugs are administered on the farm – in what doses, for what purposes, or for how long. Made public here for the first time, the feed documents thus provide unique insight into how some major players use antibiotics.  The tickets indicate that two of the poultry producers - George’s and Koch Foods - have administered drugs belonging to the same classes of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans. The practice is legal. But many medical scientists deem it particularly dangerous, because it runs the risk of promoting superbugs that can defeat the life-saving human antibiotics.  In interviews, another major producer, Foster Poultry Farms, acknowledged that it too has used drugs that are in the same classes as antibiotics considered medically important to humans by the FDA.  About 10 percent of the feed tickets reviewed by Reuters list antibiotics belonging to medically important drug classes. But in recent presentations, scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of any type of antibiotic, not just medically important ones, contributes to resistance. They said that whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and enables the strongest to survive and multiply.  Frequent, sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in low doses intensifies that effect, scientists and public health experts say. The risk: Any resulting superbugs might also develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics.  According to the feed tickets reviewed, low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some flocks at five companies: Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Perdue, George’s and Koch.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones," said Keeve Nachman, director of the food production and public health program at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.  “HIGHLY IMPORTANT” DRUGS  This month, Perdue Farms announced that it had stopped applying the antibiotic gentamicin to eggs in chicken hatcheries. Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the FDA. The company said it wants “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” because of “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.”  The move won’t change what Perdue feeds its chickens, however. Some of its feed has contained low levels of one antibiotic, feed tickets show. Perdue said it only uses antibiotics that aren’t considered medically important by the FDA, and at some farms, it uses no antibiotics at all.  The manner in which drugs are being given to poultry shows that “this could be an even larger piece of the antibiotic-resistance problem than I had thought.” Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner  “We recognized that the public was concerned about the potential impact of the use of these drugs on their ability to effectively treat humans,” Bruce Stewart-Brown, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality, said when the hatchery policy was announced.  The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.  "Several scientific, peer reviewed risk assessments demonstrate that resistance emerging in animals and transferring to humans does not happen in measurable amounts, if at all," said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. He said using antibiotics to prevent diseases in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease prevents unnecessary suffering and prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.”  Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food.  Over the years, the industry’s use of antibiotics grew. Early on, independent scientists warned that bacteria would inevitably develop resistance to those antibiotics, especially when the drugs were administered in low doses. In 1976, a landmark study by microbiologist Stuart Levy showed that potentially deadly bacteria in poultry were developing resistance to tetracyclines and other antibiotics. The resistant bacteria, E. Coli, were then moving from poultry to people.  That is when the FDA first tried to rein in drug use in food animals. The agricultural and pharmaceutical industries resisted, viewing low-level antibiotic use as a way to produce meat more quickly and cheaply.  Today, 80 percent of all antibiotics used in America are given not to people, but to livestock.  About 390 medications containing antibiotics have been approved to treat illness, stave off disease and promote growth in farm animals. But the FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of those drugs for their likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs, a Reuters data analysis found.  The widespread use of antibiotics worries public health authorities. In a report this year, the World Health Organization called antibiotic resistance “a problem so serious it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.” The annual cost to battle antibiotic-resistant infections is estimated at $21 billion to $34 billion in the United States alone, the WHO said.  Each year, about 430,000 people in the United States become ill from food-borne bacteria that resist conventional antibiotics, according to a July report by the CDC. Overall, the CDC estimates that 2 million people are sickened in the United States annually with infections resistant to antibiotics. At least 23,000 people die.  “That’s the number we are certain of. The actual number is higher,” said Steve Solomon, director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.  This year, federal investigators tracking a salmonella outbreak traced virulent strains of the pathogen to chickens raised by Foster Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast.  Investigators identified seven strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that had sickened at least 634 people across the United States and Puerto Rico this year and last. More than 200 of those people were hospitalized, according to the CDC. In July, Foster Farms issued a recall of some chicken products.  When epidemiologists examined 68 of the Salmonella Heidelberg cases linked to Foster Farms, they found that two-thirds of the bacteria were resistant to at least one antibiotic, according to the CDC. Half of these superbugs were impervious to drugs in at least three different classes of antibiotics.  In an effort to stop the spread of resistant bacteria, the FDA has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. The agency says it also inspects the mills where animal feed is made. It considers those inspections to be a “more effective” use of its resources than examining how farmers administer feed.  “These are not targeted uses aimed at specific bugs for defined duration. They’re multiple, repeat shotgun blasts that will certainly kill off weaker bugs and promote the stronger, more resistant ones.” Keeve Nachman, Johns Hopkins University  Not until 2016 does the FDA plan to gather data about antibiotic use on farms, said Craig Lewis, a veterinary medical officer with the agency. Today, “none of us have an idea first-hand of what’s going on” at the farm level, Lewis said this summer, at a public meeting on antibiotic resistance.  Super, the National Chicken Council spokesman, said the information on feed tickets “is available to FDA, the regulators, whenever they want to go see it.”  Still, companies are reluctant to discuss how they medicate their flocks.  One, Pilgrim’s Pride, said it would take legal action against Reuters unless the news agency gave the company access to Pilgrim’s feed tickets that reporters had reviewed. Reuters declined to do so.  The tickets show that Pilgrim’s added low doses of the antibiotics bacitracin and monensin, individually or in combination, to every ration fed to a flock grown early this year. Neither drug is classified as medically important by the FDA, although bacitracin commonly is used to prevent human skin infections.  The Colorado-based company wouldn’t address questions about its use of antibiotics. Its general counsel, Nicholas White, called the contents of its tickets “confidential business information.”  U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said the feed tickets substantiate what she long suspected: "that the overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.”  Gillibrand has been pushing for regulators to more aggressively monitor low-level doses of antibiotics. Now, Gillibrand said, she hopes “the FDA will use the feed-ticket data obtained by Reuters as a wake-up call to re-evaluate their approach to the regulation of antibiotic use in food production.”  So does Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, a member of a House subcommittee overseeing food safety. Told of the information in the feed tickets, DeLauro called on the FDA to “implement tighter restrictions on antibiotic usage.”  DUAL EFFECTS  All the poultry giants state publicly that they use antibiotics for the limited purpose of keeping chickens healthy.  But the feed tickets, which list the medications included in chicken feed, highlight a second effect of many of the drugs: bulking up the birds.  Some of the tickets reviewed for this article state that the antibiotics promote feed efficiency or weight gain in chickens. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on feed tickets whenever feed includes antibiotics that have been approved for that purpose.

REUTERS/Randall Hill FLOCK MAINTENANCE: Raising chickens requires constant monitoring of feed and water systems; Perdue contract farmer Craig Watts walks a house at C&A Farms in Fairmont, North Carolina in June. REUTERS/Randall Hill  Reuters found eight different antibiotics listed on the tickets it reviewed. The tickets come from a scattering of farms across the United States – in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington State, among other locations.  George’s Inc, a poultry company based in Springdale, Arkansas, issued feed tickets last year to a chicken grower in Virginia. The tickets show that the antibiotics tylosin and virginiamycin were administered solely for “increased rate of weight gain.”  Tylosin belongs to a class of antibiotics the FDA considers “critically important” in human medicine, the most crucial of three ranks of sensitive drugs. Virginiamycin is part of a class in the FDA’s middle rank, “highly important.”  Other George’s Inc feed tickets, given to two growers in Virginia this year, show the antibiotics bacitracin and narasin and a non-antibiotic drug called nicarbazin were included in every poultry ration in different combinations until shortly before slaughter. Bacitracin can promote growth.  George’s said in a statement: “Occasionally (when necessary to control certain pathogens) appropriate FDA approved medications are utilized to prevent, control or treat specific diseases.” It declined to answer detailed questions.  Use of antibiotics to stave off disease in flocks “is good, prudent veterinary medicine…. Prevention of the disease … prevents the overuse of potentially medically important antibiotics in treatment of sick birds.” Tom Super, National Chicken Council  At Tyson Foods, two feed tickets sent by the company to two Mississippi farms show that bacitracin and the non-antibiotic nicarbazin were among the drugs mixed into the feed. The tickets state the drug combination is “for use in the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler flocks, growth promotion and feed efficiency.” Coccidiosis is a common intestinal ailment.  Tyson, also based in Springdale, Arkansas, said it does not use bacitracin to promote growth, only to prevent disease. The FDA requires companies to list growth promotion on tickets if medications have that effect, Tyson said. The company said that its feed mixture changes throughout the year. In some seasons, it said, the feed doesn’t include bacitracin and nicarbazin.  At Koch Foods Inc, a Chicago-based supplier to fast-food chain KFC Corp, feed tickets contradict a statement on the Koch website about antibiotic use.  Until Aug. 27, the website said Koch Foods uses antibiotics for the narrow purpose of protecting the health of its chickens. “We do not administer antibiotics at growth promotion doses,” the statement read in part. “No antibiotics of human significance are used to treat our birds.”  Koch feed tickets dated from Nov. 30, 2011, through July 20, 2014, indicate otherwise. They list low-dose amounts of five different types of antibiotics in feed given to flocks at one Alabama farm. One was virginiamycin, in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans.  In 34 of the 55 Koch Foods feed tickets that Reuters examined, antibiotics at low-dose levels were listed “for increased rate of weight gain,” a related growth-promotion use called “improved feed efficiency,” or both. Each of those feed tickets also said the antibiotics were for the prevention of coccidiosis, another bacterial infection, or both.  Koch Foods changed the website after being asked by Reuters about its use of virginiamycin. “I regret the wording mistake on that particular letter” on the website, said Mark Kaminsky, Koch’s chief financial officer. The company said it is required by the FDA to list certain drugs as growth promoters if they have that effect; Koch says it does not use them for that purpose.  Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.  KFC U.S. said in a statement: “KFC’s supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” A spokeswoman didn’t address detailed questions about antibiotic use by Koch Foods and KFC’s other chicken suppliers.  HEALTHIER CHICKENS?  The experience of one grower raises questions about whether preventive use of antibiotics has a meaningful effect on the health of chicken.  Craig Watts, who grows chicken for Perdue, says he sees little difference in outcomes for the birds he raises on feed containing an antibiotic and those he grows for the company’s antibiotic-free line.  Perdue mixes the antibiotic narasin into feed given to chickens in the company’s antibiotic-fed line. Its antibiotic-free line contains antimicrobial drugs that kill micro-organisms, but none that the FDA defines as an antibiotic, according to Perdue feed tickets shown by Watts. None of the drugs listed by Perdue on the feed tickets is considered medically important for humans.  Watts owns C&A Farms, about 20 miles north of Dillon, South Carolina. Since 2012, he has raised five antibiotic-free flocks for Perdue and seven flocks that received low doses of the antibiotic narasin, according to his records.  The mortality rates of the two flock types were nearly identical. About 900 birds died, per house, on the four-house farm. Flocks that received antibiotics and those that didn’t both hit Perdue's target weight of about 4.25 pounds per bird.  Perdue sees “similar” performance among birds fed antibiotics and those that do not receive the drugs, said Stewart-Brown, the Perdue official overseeing food safety. “We feel our current two approaches are both very responsive to public health concerns about antibiotic use in poultry.”  Perdue still uses antibiotics in some cases, because antibiotic-free flocks are “more expensive to run and more difficult to manage effectively,” Stewart-Brown said. The production complex served by Watts’ farm recently transitioned to all antibiotic-free flocks.  TRACKING AN OUTBREAK  One poultry giant whose antibiotic use has come into question is Foster Farms, based in Livingston, California. Its experience shows the difficulty of pinpointing when and how a bacteria turns into a superbug, say federal investigators.  Beginning last year, a salmonella outbreak spread across Oregon, Washington, California and 27 other states and territories. Federal investigators later linked the outbreak to chickens raised by Foster Farms and processed at a trio of its slaughterhouses in central California, according to USDA and CDC officials.  The scope of the outbreak reflected Foster Farms’ vast scale. Its operations in California’s Central Valley date to 1939, when Max and Verda Foster borrowed $1,000 against a life insurance policy and invested in an 80-acre farm.  Today, Foster owns large tracts of California farmland, chicken hatcheries in Colorado and train cars that haul grain from the Midwest. An estimated one of 10 chickens eaten in the United States is hatched, raised and slaughtered by Foster Farms, according to industry officials. The company dominates the chicken market west of the Rocky Mountains.  As the CDC studied what investigators informally called the “Foster Farms Outbreak,” researchers soon made a troubling discovery. Some of the Salmonella Heidelberg strains linked to Foster products proved resistant to a variety of antibiotics, the CDC concluded. Some of those drugs belonged to the same classes as penicillin and chlortetracycline, or CTC.  “The overuse of antibiotics on many chicken farms is rampant.” U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York  Some questions remain. Government investigators didn’t determine how the Salmonella Heidelberg traced to Foster Farms became resistant to antibiotics, and didn’t trace the resistant bacteria to specific farms. They didn’t examine Foster feed tickets from the outbreak period to see which antibiotics the company was using and how the drugs were being administered.  Reuters asked to see Foster Farms’ feed tickets from that period; the company didn’t respond to that request.  Foster Farms said it commissioned research that yielded findings very different from the CDC’s. The company declined to share the study. It summarized the research by saying scientists found no antibiotic resistance in two dozen salmonella samples collected from Foster Farms in 2012.  A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is aware that Foster Farms sponsored a study and has asked to review it, but hasn’t received a copy.  Foster Farms told Reuters it has administered CTC and penicillin at times, but selectively, not as part of standard feed. Foster said it had used CTC “as needed” to fight bacterial infections. It declined to say where or when it administered CTC. The company said it still uses penicillin to treat sick birds, but only “in critical situations when flocks are exposed to fatal diseases.” Foster doesn’t use antibiotics as growth promoters, it said.  CDC official Robert Tauxe helped investigate the outbreak. “Use of chlortetracycline could have contributed to the resistance patterns we saw” in the Salmonella Heidelberg, said Tauxe. “Penicillin, too.”  On July 11, the CDC said the Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak had ended. The USDA said it is monitoring the company’s new salmonella-prevention efforts. Agency officials and Foster’s chief veterinarian, Bob O’Connor, said the measures are working.  The company has reduced salmonella-infection rates on chicken meat from its California facilities to less than 3 percent, O’Connor said, far below the national average of 25 percent.  Despite the gains, O’Connor said the challenge of eradicating salmonella in the chicken industry remains. “For the people who wanted a silver-bullet-type story, there isn't one,” O’Connor said. “With salmonella, we're not going to be able to say, ‘It's over.’”  David Acheson, a former senior medical officer for the USDA and the FDA, now serves on a food safety advisory board for Foster Farms. He said the board never examined Foster’s use of antibiotics and whether its practices could have spawned superbugs.  “Does anyone know that it happened? No. Is it possible? Could it have happened? Yes,” Acheson said. “We know that antibiotic use, irrelevant of what you are treating, whether it be human or animal, can increase the likelihood of resistance. It’s biology at work.”  Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter in Chicago and Livingston, California, Brian Grow in Atlanta and Fairmont, North Carolina and Michael Erman in New York.

FDA has reviewed just 7 percent of animal antibiotics for superbug risk NEW YORK – Scientists fear the widespread use of antibiotics on the farm may be a factor in the rise of “superbugs” – bacteria that grow resistant to drugs, infect humans and defy conventional medicines. Amid these concerns, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under pressure to curb antibiotic use in farm animals. In 2003, the agency announced plans to evaluate every new animal drug based on the drug’s potential to create superbugs. But the FDA hasn’t reviewed the vast majority of animal drugs now on the market, because most were approved before 2003. Reuters found that the agency has evaluated such risks for only about 10 percent of the approximately 270 drugs containing types of antibiotics the FDA considers medically important for treating humans and are also used in chickens, pigs and cattle. Overall, the FDA has evaluated the superbug risks for only about 7 percent of the approximately 390 drugs containing antibiotics that the agency has certified for veterinary use in chicken, pigs and cattle. Since the 1940s, the animal husbandry industry typically has included low levels of antibiotics in feed, in part to promote the growth of animals raised for meat. The FDA initiative to limit the risks posed by animal antibiotics took on new life last December. The agency issued a voluntary guideline calling on animal-drug makers to limit the approved uses of their drugs. Aware that poultry, pork and beef producers were attracted to many antibiotics because of their ability to promote faster growth, the agency urged the drug makers to discontinue growth promotion as an approved use on labels of medically important antibiotics. In a related initiative, the FDA by April 2015 intends to implement a “veterinary feed directive.” The new regulation will require veterinarians to oversee the use of antibiotics available over-the-counter that are mixed into feed. Today, all major makers of animal drugs that contain antibiotics, including Zoetis Inc and Eli Lilly & Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit, voluntarily have agreed to start removing growth promotion claims on product labels, according to the FDA. Labels must be modified by December 2016. As a result, 31 drugs have been withdrawn from the market by their makers, and manufacturers have changed the labels on two other drugs, according to the FDA. Even so, the labeling changes leave a loophole. No matter what labels say, meat producers can continue to use existing antibiotics at low levels, so long as producers assert the drugs are used for treatment, control and prevention of disease.

Chelsea Football Club, whose owner Roman Abramovich has put the club up for sale, is a case in point. Add in the risk of dealing with a Russian oligarch, and it seems likely that the process will attract only lowball bids.  The metals magnate said on Wednesday he would sell the west London club that he bought for 140 million pounds in 2003. He also said doing so was in the best interest of the team and its employees, hours after UK opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer pushed Prime Minster Boris Johnson to sanction him personally. The Russian pledged to donate “net proceeds” to victims of the war in Ukraine, without specifying what he meant by the term or who exactly would receive the funds.  One potential sticking point is 1.5 billion pounds of borrowings that Chelsea’s parent company, Fordstam, owes to Abramovich. The statement said he “will not be asking for any loans to be repaid”, which is not necessarily the same as definitely writing off the debt. Possible workarounds include converting it into debt-like preferred equity.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In any case, a mooted price tag of 3 billion pounds, according to Sky News, seems a stretch. That would value Chelsea at 7 times revenue from the last financial year. Stock-market investors value Manchester United (MANU.N) at 4 times the sales it generated in the 12 months to June 2021.  All of which points to a potential enterprise value with a relatively small equity component. Meanwhile, Chelsea is in a worse financial position than most. Fordstam posted a loss of almost 170 million pounds last year. Its accountants at KPMG only audited it on a going concern basis because of Abramovich’s commitment to backstop ongoing losses. The club also needs a new stadium. The Athletic has reported that previous plans to build one could have cost about 1 billion pounds.  It’s hardly a great time to do business with a Russian oligarch, either. Buyers may worry about whether they could complete the transaction if Britain hits Abramovich with sanctions. It follows that Chelsea’s sale “net proceeds” may not amount to much.  Follow @liamwardproud on Twitter  CONTEXT NEWS  - Russian businessman Roman Abramovich said on March 2 that he would sell Chelsea Football Club and donate the net proceeds to help victims of the war in Ukraine.  - Abramovich in a statement that a sale was in the best interests of the reigning European and world soccer champions and that he would not ask for any loans to be repaid.  - Chelsea’s auditors KPMG said in its most recent annual report that the club is dependent on its parent company, Fordstam, for continued financial support. Fordstam, controlled by Abramovich, had 1.5 billion pounds of related party loans outstanding on June 30, 2021.  - British opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson on March 2 why there had not been sanctions against the Chelsea owner. Johnson, speaking in parliament, said he could not go into details on specific cases.  - Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that she has drawn up a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs, and said the government would impose new sanctions on them every few weeks.

Whether it is the move away from an economic system reliant upon hydrocarbons, vanquishing the Covid-19 plague or central banks ending the free-money era, extraordinary shifts are occurring across the planet that will shape markets, corporate finance, politics and economies well beyond the coming year. These are the themes that inform Reuters Breakingviews’ annual book of predictions and prescriptions: “A World in Transition”.  Read PDF  Read online (for mobile)  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  The extraordinary actions required to drive these epochal trends are being taken now, even if it will be years or even decades before achievements can be meaningfully measured. Inevitable transitions, like the one toward renewable energy, are better embraced than resisted. Investors and entrepreneurs who can adapt to change and its concomitant upheaval will reap the greatest rewards. But they must be prepared to make sacrifices along the way. Without social inclusion, these transformations may lead to violence.  Efforts by governments and companies to reduce carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050 or sooner to limit planetary frying to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will continue to dominate the financial and business landscape in 2022. Switching away from coal, gas and oil is a priority. But every sector, including heavy industries like steel and cement, transportation, agriculture and banking, will soon need to make huge commitments to meet the lofty ambitions of the next generation. Our columnists explore all of these.  At the same time, inflation is less quiescent than in the past couple of decades. Central banks will have to start pulling away the punchbowl, which has broad implications for the cost of capital (it goes up!) and the price of money. Speaking of which, money itself will go through a transformational period as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities try to keep up with the emerging dynamics of crypto and digital currencies.  A third year of the pandemic, with the persistent threat of new, more virulent strains, continues to dramatically accelerate the shift to digital-everything. The winners and losers of this transition will become more evident in 2022. Quasi-monopolies - like Amazon.com in delivery and web-services; Meta (FB.O), the company formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in advertising; and Microsoft (MSFT.O) in workflow – were given extraordinary boosts by state-mandated shutdowns. Governments face a make-or-break year to regulate these multi-trillion-dollar behemoths. Microsoft under Satya Nadella is our pick to manage these headwinds best.  And even as people trickle back to offices, post-pandemic dynamics in communications, training, travel and social interaction are permanently reshaping the workplace and productivity. This has implications for the nature of labour, property, urban planning and beyond. It also poses new challenges to leaders, none of whom were trained at Harvard Business School or INSEAD to run sprawling organisations of employees working individually from home. That’s why we’re predicting predicting high CEO turnover, robot investment bankers and a return to offshore jobs.  The increasingly chilly war between the United States and China will dominate international trade and geopolitics. The kerfuffle over U.S. nuclear-submarine sales to Australia and America’s shambolic retreat from Afghanistan offered glimpses into the fractious nature of the Western alliance. With Xi Jinping set for a third term (if not life) as China’s president, U.S. President Joe Biden has a chance to reach détente of some sort to cooperate on climate change, the pandemic and other priorities. But with Biden’s own party facing a trouncing in November's congressional elections, his hands may be tied. On the plus side, European leadership will have a chance to consolidate as French President Emmanuel Macron likely wins a second term in May, Germany welcomes a new chancellor after 16 years with Angela Merkel at the helm, and Italy chooses its next president.  Success will require extraordinary social inclusion. Governments, companies and taxpayers (especially the richest) have to proactively prepare for the sacrifices that are needed to prevent the earth from scorching, while delivering greater equity, financial inclusion and social justice. Failure to do so will lead to civil unrest or worse. In addition to being terrible for business, that would torpedo more existential goals like limiting global warming, whose deleterious effects will be disproportionately borne by the world’s poor. Here’s hoping the business world and financial markets help guide the way to a fairer, greener and more just society in the year ahead.

Instead, it stuck around, at least nominally. Now, Russia’s pariah status after President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine presents Goldman chief David Solomon and his Wall Street peers with a new dilemma. They're not known for taking principled stands, but this could be the moment.  Big Wall Street banks – Goldman plus JPMorgan (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) – have earned nearly $500 million in investment banking fees since 2014, the year when Russia annexed Crimea, based on data from Refinitiv. For a while they cooled on the country: by 2016 the five firms’ total share of Russian fees had fallen to 6%. But by 2020 their market share was back at 38%, representing billions of dollars of deals and capital-raisings for Russian companies.  Abandoning Russia now that it’s shelling residential areas of Ukraine and threatening nuclear strikes, not to mention it being subject to widespread financial sanctions read more , would seem a no-brainer. After all, U.S. banks’ businesses in the country are small. Goldman has a local staff of fewer than 100, according to people familiar with the situation. LinkedIn shows around 280 self-identified JPMorgan employees. They were already barred from helping the Russian government issue bonds thanks to earlier U.S. sanctions.

Accountants and other professional services firms like McKinsey are under pressure to quit the country, too, according to the Financial Times.  Solomon at Goldman, for one, is yet to go there. There are legitimate concerns about local employees' safety. But exiting could mean losing the option to profit if Russia rehabilitates itself. The equation also includes China, a huge market. Beijing has mixed views on Russia, but clear ones on foreign companies that criticize governments.  Putin amended Russia's constitution in 2020 to enable him to rule until 2036, his agents meddled in U.S. elections, they poisoned individuals on foreign soil, and the State Department has called out corruption, coerced abortion and extrajudicial killings of LGBT people. Wall Street stuck around through all of that. Maybe this time will be different.  Follow @johnsfoley on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

With Moscow’s bourse frozen, firms including JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Amundi (AMUN.PA) have suspended redemptions from funds worth more than $4 billion. It’s another reminder of the fragility of asset managers’ promise that customers can withdraw cash whenever they want.  Western asset managers in Russia face multiple headaches. The Moscow stock exchange has not opened this week, preventing money managers from liquidating their holdings. Though bonds are still trading, restrictions on capital movements make it almost impossible to get money out of the country read more . American exchanges have temporarily halted trading in stocks of Russia-based companies like tech giant Yandex (YNDX.O) read more , while London has frozen depositary receipts of sanctioned banks such as VTB (VTBR.MM) read more . The sudden loss of liquidity may lead index provider MSCI to boot Russian stocks out of its benchmarks.  Funds dedicated to Russia therefore have little choice but to suspend withdrawals. Asset managers with broader emerging market remits also face risks. As investors demand cash, these funds can raise money by selling investments in other markets. But this increases the proportion of remaining assets stuck in Russia, which in turn makes customers more likely to head for the exit. Though Russia accounted for just 2% of MSCI’s emerging market benchmark index as of Monday, some funds have up to 25% of their assets tied up in the country, according to Fitch Ratings.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Investors in exchange-traded funds face a different conundrum. While some Russia-focused ETFs listed in London and New York are still trading, banks can no longer effectively arbitrage differences in the value of their shares and the underlying Russian assets. As a result, big gaps have opened up. For example, the U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Russia ETF closed at $12 on Tuesday, less than half the net asset value of its investments at the end of last week.  As the crisis drags on, more open-ended funds will be forced to suspend redemptions or penalise investors withdrawing their cash. This has happened before: several UK property funds put up so-called gates after Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, and again at the start of the pandemic in 2020.  Granted, fund managers could hardly have anticipated that Russian equities would become illiquid overnight. The scale of financial sanctions against the country is unprecedented. Once again, however, customers are being reminded that when fund managers say they can have their money back whenever they want, it’s not always the case.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces mounting pressure from Europe and Washington to align against Russia, but quick-shifting geopolitical sands make the decision a more delicate one than for most countries.  In a diplomatic nod, New Delhi abstained in two votes against Russia’s interests at the U.N. Security Council last month. Instead, Modi signalled his discomfort with Moscow’s decision to roll its tanks towards Kyiv by offering to help broker peace. He is in no hurry to oppose a country that has been a mostly reliable partner for decades on Chinese matters and India’s tussle with Pakistan over Kashmir.  The case for preserving the Russian relationship is rooted in a mutual desire for strategic autonomy. It extends well beyond any Indian ambition to protect its biggest defence supplier, a legacy of the Cold War. Russia’s top trading partner is China, India’s adversary. India’s biggest trading partner is the United States, whose tension with China persists. Those dynamics mean India and Russia help each other curb the other’s dependence on a superpower.

After watching recent events unfold in Hong Kong and Afghanistan, it’ll be hard to convince Indians that the West would rush to their aid.  Before the Ukraine crisis, India was ready to deepen its $10 billion bilateral trade relationship with Moscow. Russian energy accounts for a tiny share of India’s oil and gas imports but the expected growing demand makes it particularly vulnerable to increasing price volatility from the worldwide transition to renewables from fossil fuels. Ramping up bilateral investment, as China has just done with Russia, looked like a sensible approach. read more  Even if New Delhi sticks to its position on Ukraine, Western sanctions will complicate purchases of diamonds, arms, fertiliser and more, and force a rethink of the longer-term energy strategy.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov  LONDON, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe needs to wean itself off Russian gas. The Ukraine crisis has shown the folly of relying on Moscow for a large chunk of the continent’s 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) of annual supplies. Kicking the habit will take a concerted decade-long push.  Last year Russia piped about 150 bcm of gas to Europe. Shrinking that to zero over a decade means replacing 15 bcm a year. Yet Europe is also phasing out 100 bcm of coal-fired electricity on climate concerns, and its own production of gas is declining at 5 bcm a year. So Europe would need to make up an annual shortfall of 30 bcm, according to Bernstein analysts.  Renewable energy can fill some of the gap. If European countries keep building at the current rate, new wind and solar power projects will provide the equivalent of 11 bcm and 6.5 bcm, respectively. If the United States sends a third of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, up from 20% last year, that’s a further 6.8 bcm. Delaying the planned phase-out of existing nuclear power stations would replace 4.8 bcm of gas demand. Finally, investing in building insulation and installing 2 million new electric heat pumps instead of gas boilers every year would save a further 4 bcm.

But apart from cranking up wind and solar, which are already cheaper than fossil fuels, none of the other steps are straightforward. LNG suppliers ship to where prices are highest, and Europe’s facilities that turn the liquid fuel back into gas aren’t evenly distributed. Nuclear power is politically and environmentally contentious, and heat pumps require extensive subsidies.  To pull it off, Europe’s politicians will need help. Historically minded analysts wonder if the United States can reprise the spirit of the 1940s, when it provided funds to rebuild Europe and mobilised an airlift to Berlin. For a start, America could put pressure on Qatar, Australia and its own private companies to divert LNG cargoes to Europe. It could also help finance subsidies for heat pumps, or bolster Europe’s inadequate gas storage facilities.  Domestic consumers could help too. If 500 million Europeans took a cold shower and turned the heating off one day a month, they would reduce gas consumption by 4 bcm annually, Bernstein reckons. Shaking Europe’s addiction to Russian gas will require everyone to pitch in.  Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics  Follow @gfhay, @LJucca on Twitter  (The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists.

China relies on crude from the now pariah state for nearly a fifth of total imports. Though the pair can sidestep Western sanctions on Moscow and settle most transactions in yuan, being too helpful could backfire on Beijing. Its banks will be caught in the crossfire either way.  The two countries have been deepening economic ties for years. Russia counts the People’s Republic as its biggest trading partner; its central bank holds 13% of foreign reserves in yuan assets, up from 0.1% in 2015. At the same time, China, which ran a $12 billion trade deficit with its northern neighbor last year, bought $40 billion worth of Russian oil in 2021, or 16% of total crude imports. Just last month, the two inked a 30-year contract to supply Russian gas to China via a new pipeline.  Western sanctions on Russia, which include kicking out certain banks from the SWIFT international payment system and curbing Moscow’s access to a huge part of its foreign currency reserves, will push the two economies even closer, thanks in part to bilateral payment networks already in place. In 2017, Beijing established a foreign exchange system for simultaneously settling yuan and ruble transactions. China has also established its own answer to SWIFT, known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, to clear international claims in yuan. read more  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  In practice, though, usage of CIPS has been limited. State lenders like the $266 billion Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), (1398.HK), the world’s largest bank by assets and a major clearance bank for yuan trades in Russia, still heavily relies on SWIFT. Moreover, overtly assisting Moscow in undercutting sanctions could draw ire from the United States and allies. ICBC has stopped guaranteeing credit in dollar terms for bilateral trades with Russia, according to Bloomberg.  Beijing has options. Dedicating regional and smaller banks such as Hong Kong-listed Harbin Bank (6138.HK), based in the province bordering Russia, to specialise in bilateral trade might minimise risks for its larger banks that are more vulnerable to U.S. retaliation. But China’s balancing act is getting more precarious by the day.  Follow @ywchen1 on Twitter  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko  March 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine plans to urge about 50 additional tech companies, including in gaming, esports and internet infrastructure, to take action against Russia following a slew of earlier requests, a top Ukrainian government tech official told Reuters on Wednesday.  Software giant Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) responded within three hours on Wednesday to a tweet from Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation calling on it to stop doing business in Russia amid the country's invasion of Ukraine.  Deputy digital minister Alexander Bornyakov showed Oracle's just-posted tweet on his phone during the video interview, which said the company had "already suspended all operations in the Russian Federation". EA Games also on Wednesday said it was removing Russian teams from FIFA soccer games.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  "More sanction imposed, faster peace restored," Bornyakov said of his ministry's campaign, wearing a hoodie and sitting in front of Ukrainian flags. He said a couple of times a day, sirens alerted them of air strikes and they moved to bunkers.  Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Ukraine has already sought support from about 50 companies since Russia's invasion began last week, Bornyakov said. The outreach, which has included tweets from Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov calling on Silicon Valley CEOs to take action, has helped bring Ukraine Starlink internet satellites from entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX and new restrictions on Russian state media by Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and other social media services.  Bornyakov said among the companies he wants to see take action are Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O), which provides cybersecurity and content delivery tools to websites.  Akamai said on Tuesday it will stop serving any sanctioned customers but that none of its clients, which it said included Russian airline Aeroflot (AFLT.MM), were subject to U.S. sanctions imposed on Feb. 22.  The ministry has also called on Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to shutter their mobile app stores in Russia, but Bornyakov said the companies were more likely to block downloads of select apps.  The appeals to tech firms are part of a broader strategy by Ukraine to isolate Russia and get people to protest the Russian action, which Moscow calls a "special operation."  An "IT army" of volunteers at home and abroad, partly organized by the digital ministry through the messaging app Telegram, has disrupted access to Russian government websites and contacted about 50 million Russian civilians through social media, phone, and texts with information about the invasion, Bornyakov said. read more  He said these online forces now numbered more than 250,000 people, who were carrying out their own ideas.  "Its like crypto, it's decentralized," he said.  Bornyakov expressed little concern about cyber attacks from Russia, saying their infrastructure was weak.  In recent days, Facebook-owner Meta (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and YouTube said they had taken down influence operations and hacking efforts targeting Ukraine. read more  NFT EFFORTS  Ukraine also plans to sell NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a type of digital asset, to help with funds for the army, Bornyakov said.  "We're going to prepare a lot of cool Ukrainian-style images and 3D models. If you buy this NFT, all the donations are going to go to support the Ukrainian army and citizens," he said.  The government has already raised millions in cryptocurrency donations. read more  Before Russia's invasion, Bornyakov said the tech ministry had been focused on moving all government services online. He said these efforts meant it was already working with tech companies like Apple and Microsoft (MSFT.O) on projects such as digital passports.  The ministry was also in communication with venture funds to invest in Ukrainian startups and wanted major tech firms to open artificial intelligence and virtual reality research and development centers in Ukraine, he added.  That has changed with the invasion. "Now, we have to switch to a completely different focus. And that's actually very sad," he said.

They are seeking, through email campaigns and online petitions, to persuade firms such as internet security company Cloudflare Inc (NET.N), Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc to do more to counter Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  "Companies should try to isolate Russia as much as possible, as soon as possible," said Olexiy Oryeshko, a staff software engineer at Google and a Ukrainian American. "Sanctions are not enough."

They are appealing to cybersecurity companies in particular, asking them to drop Russian clients, especially publishers of what they say is disinformation. If that happens, the publishers would be more vulnerable to online attacks.  Igor Seletskiy, chief executive of Palo Alto-based software maker CloudLinux, has pleaded for Cloudflare to drop several Russian news websites.  "Given that even Switzerland took sides, I think it would be an important statement if Cloudflare would do the same," he wrote in an email to top executives, which he shared with Reuters.  Cloudflare said it terminated some clients because of sanctions and has begun reviewing accounts flagged in Seletskiy's email, adding that it was proceeding cautiously because cutting ties would jeopardize customer security.  Spurred on by bombs exploding outside his parents' home last week and concerned for the safety of a few of his Ukrainian colleagues who had not recently checked in, Vlad Goloshuk has appealed to a swathe of companies to help pressure Russia.  More than a dozen, among them security and web hosting providers, said they would do what they can. Some have dropped Russian customers or were considering doing so, according to replies shown to Reuters by Goloshuk, CEO of BrightestMinds, a company that helps businesses generate sales leads.  Philipp Lypniakov, who works for Spanish delivery app Glovo and has supported efforts to take down Russian websites, said he hopes the "IT war" will protect Ukraine.  1/2 Supporters gather during a rally organized by Silicon Valley-based humanitarian aid group Nova Ukraine, as Russia's invasion in Ukraine continues, outside the city hall in San Francisco, California, U.S., February 27, 2022.

Google declined to comment. In recent days, it has barred Russian state media from advertising and distribution tools and increased safety measures for users in Ukraine.  Activists also are looking at ways to disrupt the lives of Russian civilians, aiming to weaken support for the war within Russia.  An online petition organized by Stas Matviyenko, CEO of restaurant order-ahead company Allset in Los Angeles, has called on U.S. developers of entertainment, payment, dating and other apps to block access in Russia.  Big Tech's financial and supply chain muscle could help, too.

REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo  LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 3 (Reuters) - The decision by OPEC+ to stick to its plans for only a small increase in crude oil output in April shows the producer group is increasingly disconnected from the new reality of the market following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The group that houses the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies - including Russia itself - agreed on Wednesday to maintain a long-planned 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) production increase next month. read more  The group made no mention of the Ukraine crisis in a statement after the meeting, only referring to unspecified "geopolitical developments".  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  But more telling was the statement that the "current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook pointed to a well-balanced market, and that current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals."  OPEC+ is both right and wrong in this assessment.  It's correct insofar that the current physical demand and supply fundamentals don't justify the surging price of crude. Global benchmark Brent futures hit an intraday peak of $115.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the highest since June 2014.  But it's wrong to say that the outlook for the market is for it to remain well-balanced. And the Ukraine crisis is about to cause a major shift in the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.  Russia exports between 4 and 5 million bpd of crude and between 2 and 3 million bpd of refined products.  These flows are very much at risk of interruption, even though Western sanctions against Moscow have so far avoided targeting energy commodities directly.  Companies are effectively self-sanctioning, with traders, refiners, shippers, bankers and insurers deeming it too risky to buy Russian crude and products.  It's unlikely Russian exports will drop to zero in coming months, but the likelihood of them declining substantially is rising with each passing day. The escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and accompanying images of the horrors of war will make it even more toxic to deal with Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation".  The loss of crude and products from Russia, which is already occurring, will outweigh OPEC+'s paltry 400,000 bpd increase in April output - and that's assuming the group can even deliver a boost of that size.  OPEC+'s record in increasing output by as much as its stated commitments is weak at best. The group has consistently failed to lift production by the 400,000 bpd per month agreement that started in August last year.  Looking at the OPEC part of the wider group shows that output did increase by more than the commitment in February, with a Reuters survey showing OPEC lifted production by 420,000 bpd in the month.  But notwithstanding February's performance, OPEC is still about 678,000 bpd short of what it should be producing if it had increased output by as much as the OPEC+ agreement called for.  OPEC MISTAKEN?  This under-production and the likely loss of Russian barrels in coming months means the OPEC+ assessment that the market is well-balanced is not just wrong, but severely wrong.  Even if Russian oil does continue to flow, it's likely that the usual European buyers won't take any cargoes. New buyers will have to be found, thus disrupting and re-aligning global flows.  Russian crude may be tempting to some countries that are unconcerned by Moscow's increasingly destructive war in Ukraine. But if reports from physical traders are accurate, it seems that Russian crude is struggling to find any buyers, even as the main Urals grade is offered at record-high discounts of up to $20 a barrel to Brent.  As a group OPEC has some difficult choices coming. Sticking its head in the sand, as it did this week, is probably not going to be an option.  The first is whether the wider OPEC+ group is now effectively dead, given Russia's rapid exclusion from much of the world economy.  If so, OPEC needs to chart a new course, and work out whether the current high prices are worth the cost of potentially alienating most of your current buyers, as well as major political allies.  OPEC's main movers, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, all count the United States as a major ally, both political and military. But they have so far resisted calls to increase output by more than the OPEC+ agreement in order to calm frazzled markets.  If the oil market continues to fret about the loss of Russian supply and OPEC continues to ignore the problem, then the only outcome left is demand destruction and the associated global economic weakness.  It's almost as if OPEC's ostrich stance means it has lost sight of what happened in 2008's global financial crisis.

However, which of the United States’ top crops producers will prefer is still up for debate given extremely dynamic market conditions. Recent corn strength and farmers’ classic love of the yellow grain could give it the edge, especially with the prospect that No. 4 exporter Ukraine’s upcoming growing season could be in jeopardy. read more  But more corn acres would mean less room for soybeans, and supplies of the oilseed may be squeezed even further if U.S. farmers fail to plant a near-record area.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Last month, CBOT December corn futures averaged $5.90 per bushel, up 29% from last year. That is the second-highest February average for new-crop futures after $6.01 in 2011.  November soybean futures last month averaged $14.33 per bushel, up 21% on the year and topping 2011’s record by 6%.  In 2011, the corn harvest price (average of new-crop futures in October) jumped another 5% from February, but it fell 10% for soybeans.  New-crop soybeans in February traded 9% higher than in January on average, the biggest jump between the two months since 2008 and well above last year’s 2.6%. New-crop corn gains between the two months at 5% were the highest since 2011 and compare with a 3% gain last year.  The average prices of new-crop futures in February represent insurance guarantees to U.S. farmers for the upcoming harvest and the sky-high prices imply comfortable profits and potentially strong plantings of both corn and soybeans.  The new-crop soybeans-to-corn ratio averaged 2.34 in January and 2.43 in February, though it has crashed back down near 2.36 to begin March. The ratio can be an indicator of profitability potential, and values near or above 2.5 tend to favor soybeans.  High input costs and uncertain availability undoubtedly complicate that analysis this year, but the prices alone are certainly swinging toward corn right now. read more  Either way, there are reasons now for the market to be stressed over too few acres for both corn and soybeans given the situation in Ukraine, soybean losses and a to-be-determined corn crop in South America, and tight global stocks relative to demand for both crops.  Average CBOT December corn futures in February  Average CBOT November soybean futures in February  BOTH AT RISK  The U.S. Department of Agriculture last week tentatively pegged 2022 U.S. corn and soybean plantings at 92 million and 88 million acres, respectively. read more That was very close to industry analysts’ corn average of 91.8 million, but the soybean number was more than 1 million below the trade.  Although 88 million soybean acres is 1% more than last year and the third-highest ever, USDA’s balance sheet suggests those plantings are insufficient to maintain or expand U.S. soybean supplies into 2023. That is with the assumption domestic soybean use in 2022-23 will rise 3.3% from the current year.  USDA shows 2022-23 U.S. soybean stocks-to-use at 6.7% versus 7.4% this year and a carryout of 305 million bushels, down 20 million on the year. Just for fun, putting 89 million acres on USDA’s balance sheet and changing nothing else results in ending stocks of 357 million bushels.  USDA’s assumptions for corn, including a 181 bushel-per-acre yield, suggest a reasonable build in 2022-23 U.S. stocks with 92 million acres and demand nearly identical on the year. Ending stocks and stocks-to-use of 1.965 billion bushels and 13.2% compare with 1.54 billion and 10.4% this year.  The 2022-23 corn export projection of 2.35 billion bushels is 400 million lighter than 2020-21’s record, but that number has significant upside pending what happens to Ukraine’s upcoming crop or exports. The yield, four bushels above record, is also another potential item for debate.  USDA’s statistics agency is currently surveying farmers for the highly anticipated March 31 planting intentions report, so present market conditions are influencing responses. The survey period lasts until mid-March, and almost 79,000 farm operators were surveyed for last year’s report.  Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters, and views expressed above are her own.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov  LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Europe's gas futures prices for next winter are surging to a record high as traders anticipate the energy shortage will last into 2023, putting financial pressure on households and businesses across the region.  The risk of shortages this winter has been eliminated thanks to warmer-than-normal temperatures and high prices encouraging fuel-switching to coal, but now the focus has shifted to next winter.  Despite recent mild weather, stocks heading into spring are well below normal levels and Europe will have to attract significant imports and curb consumption through the summer to rebuild them ahead of the next onset of winter.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register  Until then, Europe will be competing with countries in South and East Asia to attract LNG cargoes and refill storage sites.  At the same time, the escalating economic conflict between the EU and Russia risks pipeline flows being reduced or cut off completely, either by sanctions or retaliation, leaving the region unable to accumulate sufficient stocks.  As a result, benchmark Dutch TTF futures for gas deliveries in January 2023 have doubled to 150 euros per megawatt-hour, up from 72 euros at the start of last week before Russia invaded Ukraine.  NEXT WINTER IS COMING  Gas inventories in the EU and Britain are on course for a post-winter low this year of around 259 terawatt-hours (TWh), with a projected range from 209 TWh to 309 TWh.  The position has become much more comfortable since Christmas, when the post-winter low was projected at just 212 TWh, with a range from 69 TWh to 397 TWh.  (Chartbook: https://tmsnrt.rs/3MuXvlU)  But inventories will still end winter significantly below the pre-pandemic five-year average of 315 TWh and the ten-year average of 348 TWh, according to data compiled by Gas Infrastructure Europe.  In the last ten years, inventories have risen by an average of 575 TWh between the start of April and the post-summer peak, as the warmer weather allows excess production and imports to be injected into storage sites.  If this year’s inventory accumulation follows the average path, however, post-summer storage will peak at only 834 TWh, compared with 865 TWh last year, and the lowest level since 2013.  To ensure inventories go into winter 2022/23 in a more comfortable position, Europe will need much larger injections than normal, implying high prices to attract LNG away from Asia and ration consumption by electricity generators.  The need to boost inventories ahead of next winter is already pushing prices for the next few weeks and months to record levels to discourage consumption as much as possible and leave more gas in storage.  Futures prices for deliveries in April have recently been trading at more than 160 euros per megawatt-hour in an effort to establish a higher post-winter baseline from which stocks can start accumulating.  KEY SANCTIONS ISSUES  Despite the risks, some U.S. and EU commentators and policymakers have started to explore the possibility of sanctioning Russia's gas exports to deprive the country of revenue in response to the invasion of Ukraine.  “Within the next year at least, this is the moment the west can free itself from this dependency at the least level of self-damage. Spring is coming, and with it lower heating demand,” columnist Martin Sandbu wrote in the Financial Times on Thursday.  “It is possible to run down stored reserves and there would be time to find alternative sources to refill the stores by next winter,” he writes (“Why the EU should end Russian gas imports now”, FT, March 3).  But there are not sufficient sources of additional LNG to refill seasonal storages in Europe and Asia and North America before next winter in the event of a loss of Russia’s pipeline exports.  Some of Russia’s pipeline exports to Europe could probably be redirected to customers in Asia via alternative pipelines and LNG, provided payment systems could be found to work around financial sanctions.  But the gas transport system cannot redirect all gas flows quickly: some of Russia’s output would have to be stopped for lack of logistics.  Sanctioning Russia’s pipeline exports would therefore lead to a net loss of gas available to the world market and send prices spiking for all consumers.  Restricting Russia’s gas exports would likely send gas and electricity prices soaring across Europe and Asia, intensifying inflation and heightening the risk of a recession.  Sanctions would therefore impose a severe financial cost on households and businesses in Europe and Asia already struggling with steeply rising utility bills and falling real wages.  The principal argument for sanctioning Russia’s gas exports now is that rapid escalation (“shock and awe”) could force a quick resolution of the conflict (“Shock and awe: achieving rapid dominance”, Ullman and Wade, 1996).  Gas exports lost in the next few days or weeks as a result of sanctions could be made up later in the year once the conflict is over or at least stabilised and sanctions are relaxed.  But the storage season only lasts between six and eight months so sanctions would have to be imposed then eased quickly to avoid a significant and irrecoverable loss of global supplies.  U.S. and EU policymakers are nonetheless coming under increasing pressure from opinion formers to consider sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas exports as the military conflict in Ukraine escalates.  Traders have already started to anticipate the possibility of at least some restrictions on pipeline flows – either intentionally as a result of sanctions or unintentionally as a result of payments and banking problems.  Sanctions risks have doubled futures prices for next winter even as the inventory situation at the end of this winter has improved slightly in recent weeks.  In most scenarios, Europe’s and Asia’s gas prices are set to remain very high throughout spring and summer – and they could rise to extreme levels if a sustained disruption of Russia’s pipeline exports becomes a reality.

"As part of the agreement lawmakers are working to finalize ahead of the March 11th deadline, we’re also urging Congress to include supplemental funding for two urgent and immediate needs: supporting Ukraine, and continuing our ongoing COVID response efforts," OMB Acting Director Shalanda Young said Thursday.  "The United States has provided over $1.4 billion in assistance to Ukraine since 2021, and, together with our European allies and partners, we are holding Russia accountable for its unjustified and unprovoked invasion," Young added. "To continue this important work and further support the Ukrainian people, we are requesting $10 billion to deliver additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Monday Russian airstrike that took out the Holocaust memorial site Babi Yar in the capital city of Kyiv in a news conference Tuesday, calling the destruction "beyond humanity."  "This is beyond humanity," Zelenskyy said, according to a translation from the Associated Press. "Such missile strike means that, for many Russians, our Kyiv is absolute foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history. They have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us."

"Think about this number, almost 6,000 Russian soldiers were killed."  "To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible," Zelenskyy said, according to a translation from the Kyiv Independent. "This is not to be changed by missiles, bombs, tanks, any strikes. We are in our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them."  The Ukrainian president went on to speculate about what other targets Russia might attack, if it attacked a Holocaust memorial.  "What will be next if even Babi Yar (is hit), what other 'military' objects, 'NATO bases' are threatening Russia?" Zelenskyy asked, according to AP. "Sophie's Cathedral, Lavra, Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream about. Damn them."  Russian President Vladimir Putin has attempted to justify his attack on Ukraine as an effort to "denazify" the country, playing on the Russian public's lingering hatred for the Nazi regime. Yet Zelenskyy is Jewish and had family members perish in the Holocaust. Russian officials have compared him to Jews who were forced to collaborate with Nazis.  Ukrainian officials have compared Russia's bombing of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, to the Nazi assault on the city in 1941.

"Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.

"This is their fight of their generation, and they're not going to let this moment pass without fighting to the end, and it's just extremely inspiring to see this… these people are just fierce patriots of their country and nationalists."  Russia has claimed to have taken control of Kherson, which is a port city in the country's southern region, after reportedly killing as many as 300 people in the violent assault.  Despite this, many Ukrainian officials deny the Russian military officially has control over the city.

America is on the verge of losing a second democratic partner to the iron fist of authoritarianism – just six months after the fall of Kabul. The strong resolve and resistance of the Ukrainian people have thus far withstood the onslaught of Vladimir Putin’s armed battalions.    The world is watching in horror as Putin is once again showcasing the characteristics of his Soviet KGB past, unleashing a massive war on Ukraine and its territorial integrity. It’ll also be the second time Biden has presided over an invasion into Ukraine’s sovereignty where we will look back in the history books and wonder – why didn’t we do more to prevent war?    Last December, I had the opportunity to visit Ukraine on a bipartisan Congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian military leaders, U.S. military advisors, and U.S. embassy officials to further understand the then-looming Russian invasion.  LIVE UPDATES: RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE    Republicans and Democrats stated publicly that U.S. lethal aid to Ukraine was moving too slow and President Biden’s refusal to implement sanctions wasn’t doing anything to deter Putin’s military amassment along the border. The die was cast.      Now in the early days of Russia’s unjust war against Ukraine, I’ve been amazed and heartened by Ukrainian people’s courage in their efforts to fight for every inch of their land. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demonstrated to the world he is already a 21st century Winston Churchill by channeling "I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees."    Whether Ukraine’s forces can withstand Russia’s sheer military numbers remains to be seen, but there are three key components that will lead to a successful Ukrainian resistance: the will to fight, a sanctuary, and arms and other supplies for guerilla warfare.  UKRAINE AND PUTIN: RUSSIAN LEADER IS NOT CRAZY, HE'S CONSISTENT  President Biden must make clear that the United States will continue to stand with the freedom-loving Ukrainian people should their country be overtaken by Russian forces not just with words but bullets. Just as we supported the Afghan people in their fight against Soviet invaders in the 1980s, we should continue to support a Ukrainian resistance. They have demonstrated the will to fight.  Moral is already low for Russian soldiers as they continue take massive casualties – far greater than Ukraine.  The Russian military is filled with young, inexperienced conscripts who are fighting for an army they did not volunteer for. They have spent the past few months living in frigid conditions and now find themselves in a country they are not welcomed in. Their inexperience, combined with poor logistics and stiff Ukrainian resistance, have caused Putin’s gambit to bog down.

Three decades ago, Poland and Romania broke through the iron curtain, liberating themselves from the Soviet Union oppression. Just as the United States and NATO stood in solidarity for their yearnings for independence, Poland and Romania are in perfect position to do the same for Ukraine, as Putin tries to choke them off with an iron first.

GENEVA — The U.N. human rights office says 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 injured in its latest count of the toll in Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s military invasion that began a week ago.  The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says the tally eclipses the entire civilian casualty count from the war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces in 2014 — which left 136 dead and 577 injured.  RUSSIA LAUNCHES MASSIVE SHIP CONVOY TOWARD UKRAINE, ODESA BRACES FOR ASSAULT: LIVE UPDATES  The rights office admits that the figures so far are a vast undercount. It uses a strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties. Ukrainian officials have presented far higher numbers.  The rights office said in a statement late Wednesday that "real figures are considerably higher, especially in government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration."

Ukrainian forces might have shot down a Russian missile in the capital, according to the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet.  UKRAINE CAPITAL KYIV UNDER HEAVY RUSSIAN ATTACK  The Kremlin said Friday, via a Russian state-run news agency, that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to send a delegation to negotiate with Ukrainian officials over the country's "neutral status."  That was in response to a Friday morning message from Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy, who said he was "not afraid" to engage in talks with Russia, if it could halt the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  "We heard from Moscow today that they want to talk about the neutral status of Ukraine," Zelenskyy said. "We are not afraid of Russia, we are not afraid of engaging in talks with Russia, we are not afraid of discussing anything, such as security guarantees for our state, we are not afraid of talking about neutral status."

The Moldovan ambassador to the U.S. said Wednesday his country is prepared to defend its borders if Russia or Belarus were to invade the former Soviet republic.  "The country is prepared [for] any kind of scenarios, including the very worst-case scenario," Ambassador Eugen Caras told Fox News in an exclusive interview. "So we will be defending what's to be defended."  A day earlier, video surfaced showing Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing in front of a map that appeared to indicate the Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria as a potential next target.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Lukashenko is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the region. Belarus was instrumental in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ‘Mistake’ on the map?  Caras said the Belarusians told Moldovan officials that the placement of Moldova on the map was a "mistake."  A deputy-level foreign minister summoned the Belarusian ambassador to Moldova to the Foreign Ministry and was asked for clarity, according to Caras.  "From what I understand, the ambassador said that there was a mistake on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of Belarus," Caras told Fox News.  UKRAINE STANDS UP TO RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS; PUTIN COULD LAUNCH REVENGE ATTACKS AGAINST US, EXPERT WARNS  Caras said Moldova is not in a state of panic, though the country is worried about a potential threat.  "We are very concerned with this situation. We condemn this," Caras, who assumed his post in 2020, told Fox News. "One cannot be sure 100% of the next phase. Will we be targeted or not? As of today, it seems that we are not a target."  "But what happens in a week's time? I cannot predict," Caras continued. "We are very vigilant. We are very concerned."  Caras said the Moldovan defense forces were "prepared" and that there was not an "imminent threat" of invasion.  Belarus joined Russia, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria in opposing a United Nations resolution on Wednesday condemning the Russian invasion.  NATO membership?  Moldova, which has a neutrality provision written into its constitution, hasn’t sought NATO membership, but Caras told Fox News the war in Ukraine could change that.  "I wouldn't rule out that this could shape the perception in the people's mind of the security situation or the security needs and the requirements in the future," Caras said.

Ukrainians fending off Russian attacks will be at an advantage if and when enemy forces arrive in Kyiv, in what could be a bloody battle for the capital, according to an urban warfare expert.  In addition to the army, Ukrainian civilians have taken up arms in the midst of Russian military aggression that has so far proved difficult for Moscow to confront while still struggling to achieve air dominance. They don't need to win the battles as much as they need to defend themselves, said John Spencer, a retired Army major who saw close combat in Iraq and serves as a colonel with the California National Guard and the director of Urban Warfare Training for the 40th Infantry Division.  "It doesn't have to defeat Russia to win. It just has to not lose. The goal here is just to hold on to what you've got," he told Fox News. "You know Ukrainians are willing to pay the ultimate price. They've already shown that. Russia's not willing to pay the ultimate price to take Ukraine."

Part of Russia's doctrine, Spencer said, was to unleash large amounts of firepower in an effort to create a psychological impact and protect its forces.  As the slow convoy moves closer to the capital, more attacks should be expected as Russia attempts to "soften" enemy targets and further isolate the city.  "You can clearly see their plan is to isolate all the eastern Ukraine armies on the east and to further isolate the capital," Spencer said. "That 40-mile convoy's sole purpose is to isolate and penetrate the capital."  If Russia surrounds the city, it could cut off Ukrainian fighters inside, forcing them to hold out for extended periods without reinforcements and supplies from the West as they battle block-by-block, Spencer said. However, an assault on a city versus an open area requires several times more troops than in any other environment, Spencer said.  He noted it usually takes five attackers for every defender, citing U.S. Army doctrine. Because of the terrain, cities are also good for strengthening defense plans.  Despite being outgunned, the Ukrainians can be effective in dense, urban terrain if they use their firepower and surveillance in smart ways, he said.  "The amount of combat power and forces you need to do an operation like this, Russia doesn't have it in its army if the Ukrainians defend right," Spencer said.  Since the invasion began, videos and news reports have shown Russian forces attacked, their equipment destroyed and some soldiers taken prisoner. The convoy headed to Kyiv is most likely tasked with taking the capital in what could be a large-scale assault, Spencer said.  In a Twitter thread that went viral over the weekend, he gave a crash course to civilian resistors on a number of tactics to defend themselves, including building obstacles and barriers in the streets and fighting in places where they can take cover instead of exposing themselves in open areas, something urban terrain offer in abundance.  Part of Ukraine's success is their determination but also because of Russia's failures, he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "The Russians made so many bad decisions," he said. "It was straight hubris to believe they could take Ukraine in a couple of days."

President Biden on Tuesday evening gave his first State of the Union address, which was greeted with a lukewarm reception by critics across the political spectrum and marred by gaffes and errors -- a sharp contrast the rhetoric of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has won international praise and brought translators to tears.  "The 2022 State of the Union was a mediocre speech poorly delivered," The Week’s Damon Linker said.  KAMALA HARRIS SEEN MOUTHING WORDS AS BIDEN MIXES UP UKRAINIANS AND IRANIANS  "It’s dispiriting that a White House facing so many daunting challenges could come up with so little," the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board said. "The President really does need to fire some people and get better advice."  "It’s dispiriting that a White House facing so many daunting challenges could come up with so little. The President really does need to fire some people and get better advice." — Wall Street Journal Editorial Board  Rob Noel, a speechwriter for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told Fox News Digital: "The intro on Ukraine worked well enough, but boy did he move on quickly, and not to anything particularly compelling or new.  "As a technical matter, the speech felt strung together and disjointed, with cram-ins and jumpy transitions," he said. "The substance amounted to a dry list of policy points, like it was geared toward lawmakers in the room rather than people at home."  There were some who liked the speech. David Litt, a senior speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, told Fox News that he gave it an "A."  "This is a moment when he is trying to remind a lot of Americans who voted for him and who approved of his job performance as recently as June or even September, why they supported him. And I think he did that really effectively."  Biden's bad gaffe  Online, viewers of Biden's speech noted a number of high-profile gaffes. At one point in the speech he mixed up Ukrainians and Iranians.  "Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he'll never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people," Biden said in the gaffe.  The error was noticed even by Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be seen apparently mouthing "Ukrainian" right behind the president.  He later raised eyebrows at the end of the speech by declaring "Go get him!" after praising the troops. It was not clear to whom he was referring.  The president also took heat from fact-checkers for a number of claims made during the speech, on his statement from COVID to gun control. For instance, The Associated Press called out Biden for claiming "gun manufacturers [are] the only industry in America that can’t be sued, the only one."  "That’s false," the AP said, saying that while they have legal protections from being held liable for injuries caused by criminal misuse of weapons, they are not exempt from being sued. The Washington Post, meanwhile, said that claims Biden made about job creation and deficit reduction were "misleading."  Zelenskyy's passionate appeals  The lukewarm response to the speech stands in contrast to the reception besieged Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been receiving for the way he has been rallying both his people and international support for aid to Ukraine as they attempt to fend off a Russian invasion.  ZELENSKYY'S POWERFUL SPEECH MOVES TRANSLATOR TO TEARS  Zelenskyy, who has been seen in the streets alongside Ukrainian troops and citizens, has been making passionate appeals to the world, and garnering international attention.  On Saturday, working for the German news service Welt, a translator could be heard getting choked up toward the end of Zelenskyy’s speech, before she apologized.  "Ukrainians, we know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win," Zelenskyy declared, as the interpreter began to break down. "Glory to each of our soldiers. Glory to Ukraine."  "If children are born in shelters, even when the shelling continues, then the enemy has no chance in this -- undoubtedly -- people’s war," Zelenskyy added. "To victory! Glory to Ukraine!"  Former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman said Zelenskyy "jolted the West out of its post-Cold War slumber."  "The Jewish comedian-turned-populist president that's a silver lining in these dark clouds," he added of Zelenskyy.  "It's a stark warning to China and all the other dictatorships around the world," Hoffman added.  Standing ovation  On Tuesday, hours before Biden was due to make his State of the Union, Zelenskyy received a standing ovation from world leaders after he delivered an impassioned speech for help -- calling for European Union membership.  "We have proven that at a minimum, we are exactly the same as you are," he said during an emergency session of the EU Parliament. "Prove that you are with us. Prove that you will not let us go.  "Prove that you indeed are Europeans," he continued. "Life will win over death, and light will win over darkness."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  One reporter commented on the ovation by saying he had "never [seen] it speak with one, very loud voice like this before."  There too, the official translator became choked up as Zelenskyy said: "We’re fighting just for our land and for our freedom. Despite the fact that all the cities of our country are now blocked. And nobody is going to intervene in our freedom and country and believe you me, every square of today, no matter what it is called, is going to be called Freedom Square."  At his address, hours later, Biden praised Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people.  "From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world," he said.

EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, is leading the charge of five Republicans calling on the Biden administration to enact sanctions against and investigate the Wagner Group amid reports that hundreds of Russian mercenaries are in Kyiv on a mission to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  In a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Ernst and her colleagues asked for "immediate action" be taken to investigate reports suggesting that "Russian President Vladimir Putin has hired hundreds of mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy."  They also asked for economic sanctions imposed through the Department of Treasury’s Office for Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) "pursuant to Executive Order 14024 on the Wagner Group, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, Dmitry Utkin, and Konstantin Pikalov, as well as any other known affiliates."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: MOSCOW CLAIMS CONTROL OF KHERSON AS ODESA BRACES FOR CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES  "According to the reports, the Wagner Group entered Ukraine at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin with the goal to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to undermine the peace, security, political stability, and territorial integrity of Ukraine as part of the Russian invasion," the letter asserted. "We owe it to our allies to punish private actors to the greatest extent possible that directly participate in Russia’s warmongering in Ukraine and we urge you to take all necessary measures to hold them accountable."  The Wagner Group, technically a private Russian military company, has been considered a proxy group of the Russian state abroad since its inception in 2014 and participated in the annexation of Crimea.  In December, the European Union, with support from the State Department, enacted sanctions against the Wagner Group and its associates for serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings in countries including Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Ukraine’s Donbas region.  The paramilitary organization was founded by Utkiny, a veteran of both Chechen wars and a former member of the Main Intelligence Directorate, or the Russian intelligence agency abbreviated as GRU.  KREMLIN SENDS 400 RUSSIAN MERCENARIES INTO KYIV ON MISSION TO ASSASSINATE ZELENSKYY: REPORT  An alleged close ally to Putin, Russian oligarch Prigozhin has been accused of financially backing the Wagner Group. He is wanted by the FBI for allegedly attempting to interfere with U.S. elections from early 2014 to 2018 through St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, dubbed the "troll factory."  Pikalov is a colonel who’s been accused of heading the Wagner Group’s operations in Africa.  Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, signed the letter dated March 2 and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital on Thursday. It was signed by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Mike Braun, R-Indiana, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.  Last April, Biden issued an executive order targeting the Russian Federation for broad sweeping offenses, which included undermining the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the U.S., issuing malicious cyber activity against the U.S. and its allies, and threatening "well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states."  The letter notes that Biden said in his order that "persons responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage" in the "assassination, murder or other unlawful killing of, or infliction of other bodily harm against, a United States person or a citizen or national of a United States ally or partner; activities that undermine the peace, security, political stability, or territorial integrity of the United States, its allies, or its partners" are eligible for expansive economic sanctions.  next Image 1 of 3  prev next Image 2 of 3  prev Image 3 of 3  This comes as a convoy of tens of thousands of Russian troops has been stalled outside Kyiv. Zelenskyy reportedly turned down an evacuation offer from the U.S. and vowed to fight beside his countrymen. Russian forces have gained control of the Black Sea port of Kherson, making it the first city to fall since the invasion of Ukraine began over a week ago. There’s been a mass evacuation of Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, which has been battered heavy shelling over the past several days.  The Wagner Group is not the only organization allegedly plotting Zelenskyy’s assassination.  Fox News Digital previously reported that Putin sent the battle-hardened and much-feared Chechen fighters into Ukraine to support the Russian invasion, possibly on a mission to kill or capture senior Ukrainian politicians. Ukrainian security forces "eliminated" a hit squad of elite Chechen commandos sent to murder Zelenskyy, a top Kyiv defense officials told national media earlier this week.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Times of London first reported on the alleged mission of the Wagner Group, saying more than 400 mercenaries were flown in from Africa over the past five weeks with orders to decapitate Zelenskyy’s government and make way for Russian forces to establish control of the Ukrainian capital.  A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday that there are reconnaissance forces in Kyiv but could not confirm those forces were ordered to assassinate Zelenskyy.  Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko had issued a nightly curfew, warning that any residents who go outside could be mistaken for enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups.

"Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city," the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press.  Another port city, Mariupol, has come under constant attacks, according to the city’s mayor.

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has recorded 752 civilian casualties from the start of the invasion to midnight on March 1.  The fighting comes as a Western intelligence report on Wednesday shows that Chinese officials had at least some knowledge of Russia’s plan to invade Ukraine. The report detailed that Chinese officials called on Russia to put off the invasion of Ukraine until after the Olympics in Beijing.  The Olympics concluded on Feb. 20 and Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. China has denied the report.

"And three, they are getting resistance from the Ukrainians. We have some indications - nothing that we can 100 percent independently verify - but we have some indications that the Ukrainians have in fact tried to slow down that convoy. And we have no reason to doubt those reports, but again we can't speak to it in great specificity," Kirby said.  Ukrainian forces have allegedly struck the convoy using Ukraine Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets, as well as with missile barrages, Ukrainian Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times on Wednesday morning.  "We are striking the enemy’s columns," Budanov said. "We burn many columns of the enemy."  "My intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes," he said.  RUSSIA NEWS: CONVOY 'STALLED' OUTSIDE KYIV FOR DAYS AS RUSSIAN MILITARY PLANS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER  The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence determined Thursday that the convoy has stalled in part by mechanical breakdowns.  "The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the center of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion," the ministry said in a tweet.  Reports have also surfaced that the Russian troops are facing food and fuel shortages, which may be contributing factors as to why the convoy has not moved closer to Kyiv.  UN SAYS AT LEAST 227 CIVILIANS DEAD IN UKRAINE  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Facebook post Wednesday night that morale among Russian fighters has plummeted, and he claimed some are fleeing Ukraine.  "More and more occupiers are fleeing back to Russia, from us, from you ... we are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week — plans those have been built for years," he said.  Despite the convoy not moving, Kyiv and Kharkiv have come under constant attacks from Russian forces.  Kyiv and Kharkiv are "continually under assault," but with no "appreciable movement by the Russians to take" control of those areas, a U.S. defense official said Wednesday.  Explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital early Thursday morning. Zelenskyy’s office attributed one explosion to a missile strike near the capital city’s southern railway station.  next Image 1 of 4  prev next Image 2 of 4  prev next Image 3 of 4  prev Image 4 of 4  Russian troops have continued battering Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, including with aerial attacks.

Georgian battalion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili has a long history of fighting Russia, telling "Fox & Friends" Thursday he's preparing for another battle as Russian forces close in on Ukrainian cities.  At age 14, he took on Russian forces in his home country of Georgia, and has remained a fighter for Ukraine since 2014. Now he is on the front lines in the Ukrainian war, commanding a foreign legion of over 200 soldiers and fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty as Vladimir Putin's army slams the country's major cities day after day.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: UNITED NATIONS APPROVES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING PUTIN, RUSSIA: LIVE UPDATES  "There are very tough fights all around Ukraine," he told Brian Kilmeade in front of a fortified building window.  "Unfortunately, we're having this because of Putin."  He added that "all families are fortifying their apartments and getting ready to fight."  Kilmeade asked Mamulashvili what motivates him to fight against Russia in Ukraine, and Mamulashvili responded with a story from his past.  "I faced Russian aggression when I was 14, in the nineties, when they first invaded Georgia after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, so I remember what they were doing in cities, how they were raping women and killing children in the street," he said.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: MOSCOW CLAIMS CONTROL OF KHERSON AS ODESA BRACES FOR CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES  "Today, we are seeing the same but in the 21st century. It is unacceptable for everybody. We've been fighting Russians for eight years already, and we just got the full-scale war."  RUSSIAN FORCES CONTINUE HAMMERING MAJOR UKRAINIAN CITIES ON SEVENTH DAY OF BATTLING  Mamulashvili says Russian forces are relentlessly targeting Ukrainian civilians and bombing their homes in an effort to "clean up" cities, so the invading ground forces can move in.  "They are trying to kill women and children. They are bombing apartments and their tactics are to just clean up and then Russians are entering the city."  Kilmeade mentioned a bipartisan committee of U.S. senators who, alongside British allies, will soon "start putting in the case of war crimes against Russians," including specific units.  "We've seen war crimes everywhere," Mamulashvili said. "What is happening here is already a war crime. We are seeing a lot of civilians and, unfortunately, we have lost more civilians than armed forces of Ukraine."

"We'll hold on until the end, of course."

Even as the battle between Russia and Ukraine continues, it’s not too soon for the U.S. and its allies to ask a basic question: Where do we go from here?  The transatlantic community has learned some hard lessons in the last few days. We need to build on them.  Start with NATO. Let’s not forget that it’s a political-military alliance. It exists to defend NATO territory — and collective defense means nothing if the alliance can’t commit to defending every one of its members.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES  Regardless of the outcome of this conflict, as long as Putin’s in power, Russia is a threat. Further, NATO must also be prepared to protect against any spillover of problems coming out of the Middle East, including troubles cooked up by an aggressive Iran.  The CCP fears nothing more than a secure transatlantic community. Putin has the power to do China’s dirty work for Beijing. We have to take that power out of his hands.  Then there’s China. As bad as Putin is, the Chinese Communist Party remains the most destabilizing danger on the planet. Beijing and Moscow are two sides of the same problem. Putin, in fact, is a stalking horse for the CCP. They both benefit from a divided, weakened, and distracted Europe and an isolated America.  The CCP fears nothing more than a secure transatlantic community. Putin has the power to do China’s dirty work for Beijing. We have to take that power out of his hands.  Putin can threaten us for two reasons: 1) He can threaten us with his military. 2) He can blackmail Europe over energy. Take those two weapons out Putin’s hands, and Russia becomes a nuisance power.  Putting responsible energy policies in place can’t be done in a New York minute. It’s going to take some real work. The U.S. addiction to "climate action" is still a big barrier to responsible action. But on the defense front, there is more cause for optimism.  PENTAGON POSTPONES ICBM TEST AMID TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA  Look at how Germany has responded, albeit not as soon as they should have. It immediately signaled a commitment to reach the agreed-upon NATO goal of spending at least 2% of its GDP on defense, promptly decided to field the F-35 fighter aircraft. That demonstrates that Europeans are willing to step up and do their part. Trump may have primed the pump, but it took Putin’s aggression to get it flowing.  NATO as a whole has slipped in its capacity to ensure an adequate defense of alliance territory. So there is a clear to-do list for the U.S. as well.  Europe doing more, however, doesn’t mean there is less for the U.S. to do. NATO as a whole has slipped in its capacity to ensure an adequate defense of alliance territory. So there is a clear to-do list for the U.S. as well.  Three members of NATO have nuclear weapons: the United Kingdom, France, and the U.S. Their arsenals need to be modernized and proven ready to the task of extending nuclear deterrence to every inch of NATO soil — against all comers. NATO also needs missile defense to match. The best and most stable strategic defense is a robust mix of offensive and defensive missile and bomber capabilities.  Yet NATO cannot be defended without boots on the ground, which offer conventional deterrence to complement strategic deterrence. We need to think way past having U.S. troops forward deployed to serve as a "tripwire." We need U.S. troops that can show we are ready to fight and kill an invading enemy.  In addition to having a forward-deployed American corps headquarters, there should be a U.S. heavy division stationed in Poland and a U.S. heavy brigade stationed in Romania. This would be about 10,000 troops, mostly not new troops, but keeping them in Europe instead of rotating them in and out, which is both more responsive and more cost-effective.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  We also need a lot more air-defense capability forward-deployed. Troops on the ground are of no use if they can be pummeled from the air by planes, missiles, and drones. We also need to get our air arm right. The Trump administration started to consolidate the inefficiently scattered U.S. air footprint in Europe. It is time to do more. The U.S. should place an Air Force wing in Europe.  We have work to do at sea, too. Naval forces can move fast. They are powerful and flexible. They can be a force deployed now to deter Putin. Assets should be positioned as soon as possible at two strategic pressure points: the Baltic Sea and Barents Sea.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  To coerce Ukraine, Russia has weakened its naval presence in both places. Sending in naval forces would definitely get their attention. In the long term, U.S. and NATO need a better plan for sustained deterrence in the Baltic, as well as the Black Sea.  If these steps are taken, we will show that our leaders have learned the lesson of the tragedy in Ukraine. If they are not, then, regardless of the outcome of the Ukraine conflict, we will be more at risk than ever.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAMES JAY CARAFANO

As Russia continues its attack against Ukraine, Colleen Thompson of Fort Thomas, Kentucky, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday about her family's desperate efforts to help orphans in Ukraine get out of the country safely.  One orphan in particular, "M," is a future member of their family — a teenage girl whom the family had begun the process of adopting about three years ago. They consider her their daughter and they're frantic with worry for her.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Thompson and her husband, David, have eight children, six of whom were adopted from Ukraine. Once this adoption is complete, "M" will become the Thompsons’ ninth child.  "She’s brilliant, she’s beautiful, she’s artistic," said Thompson about the young woman.  "These are children who are alone and who have been through enough trauma — more than most of us can imagine."  The Thompsons had been scheduled to travel to Donetsk earlier this week for court proceedings to finalize the girl's adoption — but the war horribly scrambled those plans. Colleen Thompson is now headed to Ukraine on Thursday, she said.  "Our daughter was in the war zone the night Russia invaded," said Thompson, who usually travels to Ukraine 5 or 6 times a year.  "M" is right now trapped in western Ukraine, where she's been moved along with other children from her original orphanage in the Donetsk region.  ‘Children who are alone’  The Thompsons want legislators to lift the bureaucratic hurdles that are preventing them and other adoptive families from bringing the children home with them to the U.S.  "These are children who are alone and who have been through enough trauma, more than most of us can imagine," Thompson said about Ukraine's orphans. "I hope that our elected officials can reach out to the State Department to expedite visas for these families."  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY  "We need assistance from our [local] congressman and our senators to help get visas processed for [orphaned] children displaced," said Thompson. "With quick visa issuance, these children can get settled here and not have to live their lives in shelters for months" on end in Ukraine or elsewhere.  She stressed, "We need our representatives to help get visas issued quickly."  Thompson understands that her new daughter is in grave danger.  "I received a frantic message from one of [her] caretakers at the orphanage saying that there were bombs going off and they were fearful for their lives," Thompson said, referencing the past few days.  "It was beyond scary and you feel helpless. Trying to aid children from a continent away is challenging."  She went on, "We were able to get my daughter and 43 children from her orphanage in the Donetsk region moved the day after the war started," said Thompson, who's been coordinating matters from her home in Kentucky, including arranging for chaperones and transportation.  The original plan was for Thompson’s daughter and other children in the orphanage to evacuate to Poland. But those plans hit a roadblock when the orphans’ chaperone dropped them off "temporarily" at a different orphanage near Lviv, Ukraine, said Thompson.  Thompson had arranged for the children to be bused to Poland, yet the director is apparently continuing to hold the orphan group in a sanatorium near Lviv. Thompson is very concerned.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES  "The way this is escalating, we’ve got kids sitting here and we’re risking a border closing," said Thompson, her voice cracking.  Americans are not permitted to serve as chaperones to get children across the border, she said — but she's heading to Ukraine anyway to see what she can do.  "We are literally begging Ukrainians to chaperone these children [safely] so we do this legally," said Thompson.  "It’s hard when you’re dealing with life or death. You’re trying to move [vulnerable orphans] and you can’t get the system to allow you to help," said Thompson.  EVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE SHARE GRATITUDE FOR HELP, PRAYERS  "We have nonprofits lined up, churches lined up, and we’re all standing here begging. We’re saying, ‘Please, let us move the children.’"  ‘Mom and Dad’  The Thompsons first set in motion their plans to adopt "M" when she was 15 years old. "M" first arrived at the Donetsk orphanage at age 4 — but a complex, bureaucratic oversight led to an 11-year delay in her being available for adoption.  The Thompsons have visited her multiple times in Ukraine and have brought her here to the U.S. as well. It's no wonder "M" has long referred to Colleen and David Thompson as "Mom and Dad."  "My hope for ‘M’ is that we can get her released with her group to travel across the border into Poland," said Thompson. "Then, to get her settled at one of the churches we have lined up [in Poland] and apply for a visa to get her here temporarily until she’s able to return to Ukraine when it’s safe."  FAITH LEADER SAYS ‘HUMAN LIFE MORE SACRED THAN LAND OR RESOURCES’  Thompson worries about both the girl's physical safety as well as her state of mind. Despite challenges in her life, "M" has always exuded optimism, Thompson said.  But as the Russians have moved in, Thompson said she's seen "M" go from a "spunky, bubbly, inherently happy, girl" to a teenager who now looks "sad and withdrawn."  "It makes me want to fight to help her and help these other kids," said Thompson.  ‘On my knees’  Thompson is hoping to enlist help from such Kentucky legislators as Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., to expedite the visa process at the State Department.  "It's beyond scary and you feel helpless. Trying to aid children from a continent away is challenging."  "I’m on my knees," Thompson said, in tears as she spoke.  "We [the adoptive families] have all previously hosted these children. We've had home studies. We have hosted these children in our homes for Christmas or summer hosting, and we’ve returned the children when it was time for them to return to Ukraine."  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HUMANITARIAN AID FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S GROUP  Thompson spoke of the "mom army" that's been working tirelessly for the welfare of the children. It's a collaboration among adoptive moms and two Ukraine-focused nonprofit organizations, Legacy Refuge and World Child Hosting.  "It quickly evolved from a few phone calls to working around the clock due to the urgency and the time difference in Ukraine," she said.  The group of moms aims to get the Ukrainian orphans to safety and then to loving families who await them with open arms.  "We are working to secure buses, get permission, get food, check to see which routes are still open, which kids we can get out from which region" and more, she said.  "I don’t think any of us, including the Ukrainians, thought [Vladimir] Putin was going to do what he did," said Thompson. She did not think an invasion would happen, or at least not to the extent the world is witnessing right now.  Thompson emphasized that there are many adoptive families in similar circumstances as the war rages. "We're not unique," she said. "I have a whole spreadsheet," she said, of adoptive families whose Ukrainian children need help.  "It would make your eyes pop out."  "M" and her peers, she suggested, might be safe at the moment — "but we don’t think that’s going to last long," she said.  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN FREEDOM AND RELIGION  Thompson says she welcomes prayer as they face great challenges ahead.  She's been posting messages on Facebook asking people to "keep praying" for Ukraine in its time of hardship.

As Russia continues to attack Ukraine, many Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans have been reflecting on the country’s independence, which notably reached a 30th-anniversary milestone in August.  Roman Sheremeta, a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, is one of many Ukraine-born citizens who remember what life was like when the country was under Soviet Union rule and how it changed after Ukraine signed its Declaration of Independence.  "I was born in 1982, so I was 9 years old when Ukraine got its independence," Sheremeta told Fox News Digital, during a phone interview.  "I remember standing with my mom in lines to get butter," he continued. "We had coupons. I remember holding these coupons and counting how many pieces of water we're going to get for our family."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  If families needed an item that was scarce – which many Ukrainians called a "deficit" good at the time – bribes or connections were usually necessary to obtain the deficit item, Sheremeta recalled.  Sheremeta continued, "Everything was the same pretty much. Everybody wore the same pants, the same clothes. We all lived in the same apartments. It had been a copy-paste system at all."  While Sheremeta was still a child when Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union on Aug. 24, 1991, he recalls his grandfather Ivan Savchuk (alternate spelling: Ivan Sawchuk) was involved with the signing of Ukraine’s Declaration of Independence, but he had to flee to Canada to escape Soviet persecution along with many of Sheremeta’s other family members.  Sheremeta told Fox News Digital that his family "suffered" under Soviet rule and persecution, but it didn’t stop them from being "freedom fighters for Ukrainian freedom."  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  On the actual Independence Day of Ukraine, Sheremeta remembers his mother, his grandfather and a number of his Ukrainian Canadian relatives traveled to Kyiv – Ukraine’s capital city – and proudly carried a "huge Ukrainian flag."  The celebration was "big" and seemed to be "everywhere" in Kyiv as citizens took to the streets to show their support for independence, Sheremeta recalled.  "Right away we were thinking and talking about what kind of money we're going to have, because obviously, we had to switch the currency," Sheremeta said. "I remember a lot of joy."  "I remember us throwing away those stars because it was so symbolic that we finally don't have to be told what to do" — Roman Sheremeta  Other standout memories Sheremeta has from that day include Ukrainians throwing out their red Soviet Pioneer neckties and star-shaped pins that featured the face of Soviet Union Premier Vladimir Lenin, which were required uniform accessories for schoolchildren at the time.  "I remember us throwing away those stars because it was so symbolic that we finally don't have to be told what to do," Sheremeta said.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  As a child, Sheremeta noticed the shift independence had on Ukraine when American chocolate bars became more accessible instead of being reserved for special holidays and when American cartoons like "DuckTales" and "Chip 'n' Dale" began airing on Ukrainian TV.  "It was unbelievable," Sheremeta recalled. "We never had anything like this."  When asked if Ukrainian independence has lived up to expectations, Sheremeta told Fox News Digital that there have been economic, social and political struggles Ukraine has faced in the last three decades as a young country, but he noted that there has been significant growth as well.  Early on, wealth got concentrated in the hands of a few "well-connected" families who bought company shares from Ukrainians who didn’t know what to do with the assets that were given to them after the country achieved its independence, according to Sheremeta.  This economic shift led to the privatization of corporations with minimal market competition, he said, which has made some citizens question capitalism on occasion.  "In most democracies and with people around the world, they fight for their democracy, and there’s a lot of bloodshed," Sheremeta said. "Ukraine in 1991, didn't have that. We were handed that for free… I think to a certain extent, we did not know what to do with democracy because it was handed to us. And so because of that, we made a lot of mistakes as a country."  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  In recent years, Sheremeta said Ukrainians have mostly moved away from having a "Soviet mentality" as the country has seen more success with democracy and its market economy.  Ukraine has built itself up with new profitable companies, especially in the sphere of information technology.  "In most democracies and with people around the world, they fight for their democracy, and there’s a lot of bloodshed" — Roman Sheremeta  "Ukraine has really propelled the further we got away from Russia," Sheremeta told Fox News Digital. "A lot of people got much wealthier. There was a development of a middle-class people."  "This is past 2014. That's where things started to pick up," he continued. "And we have established a lot of great companies that went public in the states and have done tremendously." Some of the founders of the biggest companies in the U.S., like even Google, and others, will have a significant trace of Ukrainian talent in them. That has been, again, a new legacy of Ukraine."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  Sheremeta noted that Ukraine’s growth has been achieved "despite the constant pressure" of Russian aggression led by President Vladimir Putin, who has actively tried to discourage the "Western ideology of democracy and free markets" in Ukraine and neighboring countries.  He went on, "Ukraine has done really well. And, obviously, for Putin, that has been a stumbling block, and he needed to create a narrative that, ‘If you want to go with the west, look what's what is going to happen to you, you are not going to have a successful country, and the west is not going to help you either."  "A successful Ukraine is a nail in the coffin of Putin’s regime" — Roman Sheremeta  Sheremeta said Ukraine’s desire to join North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also plays a part in Russia’s attack because Putin doesn’t want the alliance expanded, but he questions whether the Russian leader would attempt to attack Finland and Sweden – which are two countries that haven’t disavowed NATO.  "A successful Ukraine is a nail in the coffin of Putin’s regime," Sheremeta said. "If Ukraine can establish a precedent of being a successful country because it went with democracy, it went with free markets, then that will be the final nail in the fall of the Soviet Union, which obviously Putin has been trying to restore. So, it's a fight between two different civilizations and Ukraine, unfortunately, is at the crossroad of that."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Sheremeta, who is the founding director of American University Kyiv, told Fox News Digital that he believes the Russia-Ukraine war is "the most crucial battle of our century" because it’s the battle of world view and democracy.  He went on to say that Ukrainian resistance has shown the world that "Putin and his regime is not as scary as everybody thought" and "he can be beaten" even with Russian forces shelling Ukrainian cities.  "I see Americans, I see people from around the world, gathering in hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across the globe in support of Ukraine" — Roman Sheremeta  Sheremeta noted that countries that seemed to have doubted Ukraine after Russia’s initial attack on Thursday, Feb. 24, have already switched their stances and are providing Ukraine military aid following the country’s strong defense.  "Ukrainian people will not give up," Sheremeta said while pointing out people of all ages and industries have taken up arms to defend their country.

I see Americans, I see people from around the world, gathering in hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across the globe in support of Ukraine."  Sheremeta said, "This is a fight that Putin cannot win. Ukraine will win. The question is, ‘At what price and how much the West is going to be involved?’"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine represents the beginning of World War III, an attack on the free world, a Ukrainian member of parliament told Fox News early Thursday.  Alexey Goncharenko claimed he implored the U.S. to provide his country with weapons. He also said Ukrainians would give Russian President Vladimir Putin "hell" if he invades Kyiv.  On Fox & Friends First, Fox News' Trace Gallagher noted that the U.S. is hesitant to put American troops in Ukraine because it might lead to World War III, to which Goncharenko replied that World War III had already started.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The World War III already started. If somebody doesn't see it, it's their problem," the lawmaker said. "It's war, not against Ukraine, but against the whole free world."  Goncharenko said he does not ask the U.S. to send troops, but weapons.  "We are not asking for boots on the ground, but give us possibilities," the lawmaker said. He specifically asked for Patriot missiles and a no-fly-zone on the border with Poland, a "humanitarian air corridor" to help evacuate children from fighting areas. He also asked the U.S. to impose a "ban on Russian oil and gas."  Goncharenko said that "morale is very high" in Ukraine. He is a member of the civilian militia of Kyiv, the capital city, and he promised that if Putin invades the city, "We will meet him there and there will be a hell for them, I assure you."  The lawmaker predicted ultimate victory for Ukraine, but he warned of "a massacre" if Russia takes major cities.  "Certainly, there will be guerilla fighting and we will never accept" Russian rule. "We want peace, we want peace as soon as possible, but we are not going to surrender."

"It looks like all these peace talks from Putin for the moment are just tricks."

Joe Biden delivered this country's first-ever State of Ukraine address last night. Biden spoke for a little more than an hour before a joint session of Congress. He talked far more about Ukraine and with much greater passion than about any other topic. If that sounds strange for an American president in a speech that's supposed to be about America, it didn't seem weird at all within the context of last night. Biden delivered exactly the speech his audience wanted to hear. Virtually every lawmaker in the room last night from both parties arrived wearing some version of the Ukrainian flag. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy came with both a Ukrainian-themed pocket square and a Ukrainian flag lapel pin. That's about as Ukrainian as you can get. Even the president of Ukraine doesn't do that very often.  What McCarthy conspicuously didn't do was don an American flag pin. No, not at all. And many others went without that, too, because within the context of last night, the American flag was literally irrelevant.  Lots of our leaders feel that way, all of a sudden. At this stage, the full force of America's federal government, the White House, the Congress, the intelligence and defense and law enforcement agencies, all of it has been redirected to avenge the invasion of Ukraine.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION REPORT CARD: EXPERTS GIVE THEIR GRADES  Notice the verb - avenge, not defend. Now, ideally, you'd like to think there would be some way to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression that might be worth doing. But at this point, there isn't. It's too late. Joe Biden's deterrence strategy failed. Putin already invaded the country. Short of destroying Ukraine, there is no way to liberate Ukraine by force. All we can do is punish the Russians for what they've already done, and that, Joe Biden told us last night, is exactly what he plans to do.  JOE BIDEN: The ruble has already lost 30% of its value. Russia's stock market has lost 40% of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling and Putin alone is the one to blame.  So, the Russian economy is being destroyed, is destroyed, imagine living in a country where the currency drops 30 points in a single day, what would that feel like? Well, 143 million Russians now know. They're much poorer than they were two days ago. Only a relative handful of those Russians had any role in the invasion of Ukraine. Many of them opposed it. But all of them are being hurt as their economy comes apart.  And that's fine because they all deserve it. Michael McFaul, Barack Obama's former ambassador to Moscow, who now teaches at Stanford University, announced today that every single person in Russia, every single one, bears the guilt of the Ukraine invasion. "There are no more innocent, neutral Russians anymore. Everyone has to make a choice, support or oppose this war."  So to restate and be clear, there's no such thing as an innocent Russian, one of our foremost Russia scholars has told us so. Putin may have given the orders to invade Ukraine, but six-year-old girls in St. Petersburg should pay the price for it because they deserve it. Their 80-year-old grandmothers deserve it, too.  In order to fight tyranny, the United States must embrace collective punishment, hurt the children to bring justice. These are our values because Vladimir Putin is a moral monster. Now, these are not traditional Western concepts of justice, but Joe Biden wholeheartedly endorses them, and so does a dominant bipartisan coalition in the United States Congress.  BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS  The question is: Is this a wise course? Now we can't say. Far be it from us to suggest thinking through world-changing policies in any way before enacting them. Pausing to reflect, we have learned, is disloyal. Adult moral calculations are treason. Thinking about your own country is a crime. Act now or be denounced. So we're going to withhold judgment on all of this.  But we did notice one question that Joe Biden failed to answer last night or even address. And that is: What's the point of all of this? Putin is bad. No one in America is going to argue with that, but will destroying the entire Russian economy make Putin less bad? Will it force Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine? And if it will, how exactly will that work? And how long will it take? Or is the plan bigger than that? Is the idea that we can force Vladimir Putin from office entirely? OK. Will that work? And if it does work, what happens to Russia after Vladimir Putin leaves? Would the next Russian president be an improvement over Putin? Or would Russia descend into barbarous chaos like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan did once we overthrew their governments?  Now, you may not care what happens to Russia, but you have to wonder what would become of Russia's enormous nuclear stockpile under those circumstances. Take a moment and think. Are there potentially ways that thousands of unsecured Russian nukes might pose a long-term threat to the United States? Something to think about, not that anyone is.  The immediate goal, again, the bipartisan goal is to turn Russia into a pariah state. Now again, the question isn't whether Vladimir Putin deserves that. It's more than a moral question. The question is how will that work out for us and for the world? American citizens have a right to ask that question.  Start with history. How has that worked with Iran and North Korea? Now that those countries are cut off from the fraternity of civilized nations, are they more or less predictable? Are they more or less dangerous to the United States? Could it be possible that some of these steps in the end turned out to be counterproductive to our interests? That's something to consider.  Keep in mind the very people proposing all of this are the very same people who defunded our police departments and destroyed our schools and tore down the Teddy Roosevelt statue in New York City. They're the ones who armed the Taliban. They're the ones who devalued the US dollar. They're the ones who brought human slavery back to Libya. They're very good at wrecking things. It's what they do. They planned the Iraq War, and they never apologized for it.  So we might to make sure they don't wreck anything else ever again, especially this country. But once again, Joe Biden didn't address any of that last night, he was too deep in his World War II fantasies with himself playing FDR. For all of his moral outrage against Russia, well deserved, though it may be, Biden made no mention of China's role in the invasion of Ukraine, and that's weird.  NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION REMARKS ‘REALLY FRIGHTENING’  More than any other country on Earth, China made this invasion possible. China is Russia's most important ally in this war against Ukraine. So you have to ask yourself, as long as everyone's culpable who was involved, why aren't we tanking China's currency? Why aren't we banning Chinese planes from American airspace? Why aren't we confiscating the yachts of Chinese oligarchs? Biden never told us. Maybe some more ask him.  Biden was off to other topics, but not the topics you would expect. Biden never mentioned the word equity a single time last night, we checked the transcript. That's very strange. Equity was supposed to be the central focus of his entire administration. I was just 13 months ago. He told us that, and we still have the tape.  JOE BIDEN, JAN. 2021: We need to open the promise of America to every American, and that means we need to make the issue of racial equity, not just an issue for any one department of government. It has to be the business of the whole of government.  Well, that is a very abrupt change, and again, it's worth marking these changes because no one seems to notice them. In the space of one year, equity went from quote the business of the whole government to something the president doesn't even mention in a State of the Union address. What's that about? Was equity not quite as popular as they expected?  And there were a number of moments like that in last night's speech moments that left you scratching your head. At one point, Joe Biden said, we needed to fund police departments - the ones that his party defunded. And then, in case you hadn't had enough beers by that point, Joe Biden said, we must secure the border.  Now, why is Joe Biden saying this? Far be it for us to suggest they were terrifying internal polls suggesting he has to say those things. But we're starting to conclude that. Because just a few minutes after Joe Biden said we need to secure the border, he announced amnesty for millions of foreign nationals who snuck into our country.  JOE BIDEN: Provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers, those with temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. Revise our laws. So businesses have workers they need who families don't wait decades to reunite. It's not only the right thing to do, it's economically smart thing to do.  That's the economically smart thing to do. Give your job to a foreigner, and if you don't, you're immoral. So that category just three status dreamers, those with temporary status, farmworkers and something called essential workers. Who do you think, who's come across the border illegally, the millions in the last 13 months would be denied the classification, essential workers? Well, of course they're all essential. Every single one of them.  MSNBC'S JOY REID COMPLAINS BIDEN WAS TOO NICE TO REPUBLICANS IN SOTU  So moments after telling us he's going to secure the border, Joe Biden just announced that everyone who's already snuck across the border gets to become a U.S. citizen and, needless to say, a Democratic voter immediately because it's the right thing to do.  That was the portion of the speech where he talked about our country. So the first part was about how borders are sacrosanct and we should go to war to protect other people's borders. And the second part was, everyone who's already snuck in gets to become an American citizen. Does that apply to Russian soldiers in Ukraine? One of the principles here, exactly.  Then Biden went on to mention someone called Kentaji Brown Jackson, and that's not a name most Americans know because Kentaji Brown Jackson has been an appellate judge for less than a year. But Joe Biden is sure that she is one of our "top legal minds."  JOE BIDEN: We all know one of the most serious constitutional responsibility a president has is nominate someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court, as I did four days ago. I've nominated a Circuit Court of Appeals Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation's top legal minds.  So is Ketanji Brown Jackson, a name that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing, one of the top legal minds in the entire country? We certainly hope so. Biden is right. Appointing her is one of his gravest constitutional duties. So it might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Kentaji Brown Jackson's LSAT score was? What how'd you do in the LSAT? Why wouldn't he tell us that? That would settle the question conclusively as to whether she's a once in a generation legal talent, the next learned hand?  It would seem like Americans in a democracy have a right to know that and much more before giving her a lifetime appointment, but we didn't hear that. And that was just one of many things that Joe Biden left unsaid last night. He alluded, for example, to rising crime, but not his role in it. He claimed instead that its gun companies, not prosecutors, funded by George Soros, not the celebrity funds which bails out murderers that have made this country more dangerous.  JOE BIDEN: Ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines 100 rounds. You think the deer wearing Kevlar vests? Look, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can't be sued. The only one.  Now, far be it for us to fact-check Joe Biden. Like questioning his foreign policy. That's Russian disinformation is disloyal. It may be punishable under our treason laws, but we should point out that what he said was, what's the word? A lie. Gun manufacturers, of course, can be sued. It happens all the time.  But now that Joe Biden mentioned it, there is in fact an industry in America that has total legal immunity from lawsuits. That immunity was granted that industry by Congress. In fact, here you have a president who single-handedly turned that industry's corporate executives into billionaire oligarchs by forcing Americans to use their products. They had to.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  But here's the best part. If the Americans who were forced to use those products were killed or injured by those products, as many thousands have been over the last year, they have no legal recourse. They can't sue the industry. They can't even complain about it on television or mention it on social media. And neither can actual experts, physicians and nurses, for example, they've been silenced. You know this perfectly well, Biden knew this. He was flagging for these companies the minute he got to the podium, just looking flak for the credit card companies in Delaware, many people he was speaking to last night in the room are invested in that industry. But he never said a word about it.  This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the March 2, 2022 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

Abramovich released a lengthy statement giving his reasoning. While he hasn’t called on Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, he said the proceeds from the sale would go to benefit war victims.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "I would like to address the speculation in media over the past few days in relation to my ownership of Chelsea FC," he said in a statement. "As I have stated before, I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners.  "The sale of the Club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club. Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery."  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXBUSINESS.COM  Abramovich, who is worth more than $13 billion, bought the club for more than $187 million in 2003.  Here's a few more details about Abramovich.  Chelsea’s success  Abramovich's cash injection into Chelsea led to many successes on the field since 2003.  The Blues have won five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, two Champions League titles, two Europa League titles and a Club World Cup win in 2021.  Some of the star players to play for the club during Abramovich’s tenure have included Eden Hazard, Petr Cech, Frank Lampard, Christian Pulisic, Eiður Guðjohnsen and John Terry.  Abramovich’s wealth  According to Forbes, Abramovich owns stakes in Britain’s Evraz – a steel manufacturing and mining company – and Russia’s Norilsk Nickel – a mining and smelting company. He also sold his 73% in Russia’s Sibneft to Gazprom in 2005 for $13 billion. He is also the founder of Millhouse Capital LLC, an investment firm.  Abramovich also owns one of the world’s largest superyachts. The Eclipse is 533 feet long, has two helicopter pads, 1 mini submarine and three landing boats. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, it also has a missile detection system. The yacht can reportedly fit up to 70 crew members and has 11 cabins.  Pressure mounts  British lawmakers had come on strong against Abramovich.  While U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be "inappropriate" to comment on individual cases, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took aim at Abramovich.  "We must stand up to Putin and those who prop up his regime," Starmer said. "Roman Abramovich is the owner of Chelsea Football Club and various other high-value assets in the United Kingdom. He’s a person of interest to the Home Office because of his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices."  Labour Party legislator Chris Bryant used parliamentary privilege to say Abramovich was already looking to offload other London properties in fear of being sanctioned.  "The danger is that Mr. Abramovich will have sold everything by the time we get round to sanctioning him," Bryant said.  British commentator Piers Morgan added: "Abramovich sells Chelsea - but still doesn’t say a single word of condemnation for what his mate Putin’s done."  Potential buyer  Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss told Swiss media he received an offer to buy Chelsea along with three people. Chelsea and Abramovich’s representatives reportedly didn’t dispute the claim.  "Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly," Wyss told Switzerland’s Blick. "Abramovich is currently asking far too much."  However, Wyss said he would want a group to help facilitate the purchase. Chelsea is said to be worth about $3.34 billion.  Wysss is an 86-year-old billionaire. He is reportedly worth about $5.1 billion, according to Forbes. He sold Synthes USA to Johnson & Johnson for nearly $20 billion.  Alleged Putin ties  Abramovich’s relationship with Putin has been thrust into the spotlight several times over the last decade or so.  According to the book "The Crisis of Russian Democracy: The Dual State, Factionalism and the Medvedev Succession," Abramovich suggested to Boris Yeltsin that Putin become the successor as Russian president. He had interviewed potential cabinet members before Putin signed off on them during his reign as prime minister.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  In 2012, a London High Court judge suggested that Abramovich had "very good relations" and "privileged access" to Putin though he couldn’t "pull the presidential strings." Abramovich denied the claim.  In 2020, a book published by HarperCollins suggested that Abramovich purchased Chelsea at the behest of Putin. Abramovich won a lawsuit against the publisher and author and received an apology with the references removed, The Jerusalem Post reported.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Chinese officials in early February asked Russian officials to wait until the Winter Olympics in Beijing had concluded before sending troops into Ukraine, U.S. officials said, according to a report.  A Western intelligence service collected the information before the invasion and the U.S. considers it credible, according to the New York Times. The intelligence reportedly shows that China had some knowledge of Russia's plans.  The U.S. and its allies reportedly used the information to help determine when Russia might invade.

The Dilbar, a 512-foot vessel belonging to billionaire Alisher Usmanov, was taken over by authorities while it was being refitted in a German shipyard, Forbes reported.  The business magazine learned about the move Wednesday, just two days after Usmanov was sanctioned by the European Union as part of its response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the report said.  The EU has accused Usmanov of being a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a supporter of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, the Washington Examiner reported.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Usmanov on Tuesday confirmed that financial actions had been taken against him.  "On 28 February 2022 I became the target of restrictive measures imposed by the European Union I believe that such decision is unfair, and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honor, dignity, and business reputation," he wrote Tuesday.  The statement was posted on the website of the International Fencing Federation, where the former professional fencer served as president since 2008 until stepping down Monday, the Examiner reported.  The Dilbar had been undergoing work at a shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, since October, according to Forbes. Employees of Blohm+Voss, the shipbuilding firm overseeing the project, were not at work Wednesday, the report said.  German shipbuilder Lurssen, which built the Dilbar, claims it’s the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, weighing nearly 16,000 tons, according to Forbes.  When operating, the ship has a crew of 96 people. It features an 82-foot swimming pool, two helicopter pads, sauna, gym and beauty salon and has 12 suites for accommodating 24 guests.  Usmanov is a former stakeholder in the English soccer club Arsenal FC, having sold his 30% share of the club for nearly $700 million in 2018, the report said.  Usmanov retained a connection to the English Premier League through sponsorship deals involving his companies but those deals were discontinued, the Examiner reported.  Separately, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich said Wednesday that he will sell English club Chelsea FC and donate proceeds to Ukraine war victims.  Usmanov's fortune comes largely from investments in the production of iron ore, steel and consumer electronics, as well as smaller stakes in telecom, mining and media companies, Forbes reported.

President Biden and other Western leaders have made Russian oligarchs a target of their efforts to put economic pressure on Putin as he continues the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

A prominent Russian journalist quit her state-TV job after condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, raising questions about whether she could be targeted by the Kremlin over the decision.  The Russian version of Russia Today, a state-run media operation also known as RT, lost its editor-in-chief on Tuesday when Maria Baronova resigned after publicly condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Znak.com.  "If I chose to be with Russia, this does not mean that I should walk in a totalitarian system, be silent or, for example, rejoice that the regime, which I do not want for my country, is being exported somewhere else," Baronova wrote last week on her Telegram channel, Znak.com reported. "And this regime will finally turn our life into one endless hell. What's there. Already turned."  A few days after that post, Baronova left the state-run network and told Znak.com that she had "nothing else to talk about."  PENTAGON POSTPONES ICBM TEST AMID TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA  Intelligence expert and national security commentator Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital she doesn’t believe the Russian president will target Baronova personally because she’s a relatively "small fish" compared to someone like opposition leader Alexei Navalny.  "Putin actually dispatched assassins to target Navalny and to eliminate him," Koffler said, adding that pro-Russian groups that are loyal to Putin could attack his enemies without an official order from the Kremlin.  "That sort of thing I don’t rule out, like random attacks," Koffler said. "The people on whom [Putin] orders such things, the threshold is pretty high."  Koffler, the author of "Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America," said the Kremlin typically looks to assassinate people like Navalny or Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer who betrayed Putin by working with British intelligence.  "The Russians tried to poison him with a military-grade nerve agent," Koffler said. "These are the levels of opposition in Putin's mind that would call for such things."  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  Fox News Digital could not find any examples of Putin being directly linked to the murder of a journalist. However, 38 journalists have been murdered in Russia since 1992; 81 percent of those cases have not been solved, and seven journalists have gone missing in Russia and have not been found, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.  At least five journalists have been arrested for their coverage of the invasion of Ukraine, recent reports show.  In 2018, the Associated Press published a report outlining a list of reporters who had been critical of the Russian government and wound up killed or beaten.  "In most cases, their attackers walked free," the AP reported at the time.  Putin put an international spotlight on Russia last week by invading Ukraine with an assault that has targeted everyone from civilians to women, children and students.  Baronova’s resignation signals "that at least some people in the Russian media understand that Putin has gone too far and are actually willing to protest," Koffler said, but she doesn’t expect it to force any change.  "Is it going to change Putin's behavior? Absolutely not," Koffler said. "Is it going to lead to a mass exodus from Russia today? No."  US NONPROFIT DRIVING ESSENTIALS TO UKRAINE REFUGEES AT ROMANIA BORDER  "It's good to see, you know, individual people doing that. But Russian media in general is controlled either directly or implicitly by the Russian government. There's virtually no independent media in the way that we in the U.S. understand independent media rights," Koffler added. "Some of the media outlets are directly like straightforward mouthpieces of the Russian government and the Kremlin."  Znak.com is not a propaganda outlet and the report about Baronova’s resignation can be taken seriously, but it’s not as critical of Putin as Dozhd’ TV, which was designated as a "foreign agent" because it was hard on the Kremlin, Koffler noted.  "This woman is brave, and believe me, it’s not easy to be this brave because she may not find another job … the Russian government is very oppressive in terms of the media and they can come after her," she said.  Roskomnadzor, Russia’s federal body responsible for overseeing media, has urged all news outlets to only use "trustworthy sources" when it comes to reporting on the invasion of Ukraine, Koffler said.  "What they mean by that is Russian government sources," Koffler said. "I’m certain that if somebody does not obey this order, they will be blocked."  Dozhd’ TV and Ekho Moskvy are two outlets that were banned on some platforms for not cooperating, she said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Perhaps Barona's resignation was inevitable.

The Russia-Ukraine war moved into its eighth day on Thursday, as Ukrainians across the world have continued to show their unrelenting support for their homeland.  "America is with you," said Andrij Dobriansky, a New York City-based community leader, when asked if he had a message for those in Ukraine. "I hope that Ukrainians understand that they're not alone."  Dobriansky, who co-chairs the United Ukrainian-American Organizations of New York, told FOX Business he has seen Ukrainian flags flown prominently throughout the city and said local communities are eager to help.  "Almost everybody is donating in some way or putting up posters about where to donate," he said. He urged anyone interested in contributing money toward Ukrainian refugees to do so by visiting the Ukrainian Congress Committee’s website.  ‘Outpouring of love’  Jason Birchard, owner of famed Ukrainian restaurant Veselka in New York City’s East Village neighborhood, said he and his staff have received "an outpouring of love and support." He estimated 40% of his staff was Ukrainian.  "I want the world to know how much Ukrainians love our country. It is in our blood." - Oksana Bats to FOX Business  "Customers are coming to check on them and support Ukrainian businesses. It has been overwhelming. I'm doing double the business I'd normally do," Birchard told FOX Business. "I can't keep up with my takeout orders. There's a line out the door at 9 a.m."  AUSTIN BUSINESS 'THE RUSSIAN HOUSE' SHORTENS NAME IN SOLIDARITY WITH UKRAINE  On Tuesday, Veselka announced a campaign to donate the proceeds from all orders for borscht, a traditional Ukrainian food.  "All our Ukrainian borscht sales will be donated to the Ukrainian relief efforts," Birchard said.  The restaurant is also sharing other, previously vetted nonprofits, and additional ways for people to support the community on its website.  Birchard’s grandfather immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1940s to escape Russian oppression. He opened a newsstand and candy store at the corner of Second Avenue and East Ninth Street, and converted the shop into a restaurant in the 1950s.  The proud Ukrainian-American said members of his staff are from all over Ukraine, including some who have parents in Kyiv and siblings who are fighting in Ukrainian forces. They’re "distraught, emotional," he said, but have chosen to work despite his offers to continue paying them while they take time for themselves.  "This is not just a war on Ukraine, it's a war on the free world. We all need to stand up collectively: the U.S. the E.U.," he went on. "We are desperately trying to get a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The soldiers are fighting back as best as they can, but we're fighting one of the mightiest armies in the world. Putin is a tyrant and needs to be stopped at any and all costs."  US TECH COMPANY IN UKRAINE: EMPLOYEES VOLUNTEER TO FIGHT RUSSIA  Many more customers  Dmytro Kovalenko runs Streecha, which is also in the East Village and is owned by St. George Ukrainian Catholic Church. The restaurant, which opened more than 50 years ago, has had three times more than its usual customer load since the invasion began, Kovalenko told FOX Business.  He has since posted a QR code at the front of the store for customers to scan if they’re interested in donating money for the Ukrainian military forces.  "My customers can come to Streecha, scan the QR code and send money directly," he said.  Kovalenko moved to the U.S. in 2014, but still has family – including his mother, his sister, and her 2-year-old child – in Dnipro, in the eastern part of Ukraine.  "It’s hell, it's really hell," he said. "They live in the underground garage to try to hide, trying to find some safety against the airstrikes and shelling."  He added: "We all hope that our forces are strong enough to resist and of course we need support from other countries."  ‘They know what to do’  And Stepan Rogulskyi, owner of Varenyk House in Queens, moved to the U.S. in 2008 and now lives in the borough's Maspeth neighborhood with his wife and toddler. His parents, grandparents and cousins are still in Ukraine.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  He told FOX Business customers were supporting his restaurant and the community. When asked if he had a message for the people of Ukraine, he said he didn’t think anything he said would help.  He added: "They are united. They know what to do."  Across the Hudson River, Oksana Bats, president of the Jersey City, New Jersey, branch of the Ukrainian National Women’s League of America, said Ukrainian-Americans there are also feeling the support from their community.  "We want to spread the word about what’s going on," she said. Bats’ parents and brother remain in Ukraine, as well as her husband’s family. "[I’m] just so appreciative on how American people support us. We feel important."

Bats came to the U.S. from Lviv in 2015 and is now helping to raise money and awareness for the Ukrainian relief effort.  "I want the world to know how much Ukrainians love our country," she added. "It is in our blood."

Congress can play a major role in the war raging in Ukraine due to the unprovoked aggression by Russia. Whether or not the Biden administration manages to get its act together, there are important steps Congress can take to mitigate this foreign policy disaster.  1. Demand Europe beef up security budgets: All NATO nations in Europe must live up to their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on national defense. President Trump successfully gained great compliance overall. But after telling President Trump they couldn't possibly meet the target before 2031, Germany has now suddenly committed to do so as war rages in Ukraine. Congress must call upon all NATO nations to follow suit if they want the support of the U.S.A.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES  2. Become a net energy exporter: Congress can and must reverse the disastrous energy policies of the last 13 months and return to energy independence. That means approving oil and gas leases, pipelines, and LNG export infrastructure. Europe must have an alternative to Russia to supply baseload power. Europe desperately needs energy. We can give them a viable clean alternative that doesn’t subject them to the whims of a radical Putin regime. Europe is learning the hard way that conventional and even nuclear war is the real existential threat – far exceeding climate change. Encourage more windmills and solar panels, but other reliable sources of energy should be readily supplied when needed.  3. Fast-track nuclear energy on our shores: Clean, efficient nuclear energy can supply domestic baseload power even when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Cutting edge nuclear microreactors may soon offer a promising alternative to nuclear storage that can operate using spent fuel from conventional reactors. Congress should return to an all-of-the-above energy policy that diversifies our energy consumption and keeps us from relying on political adversaries for basic needs.  4. Support the Expansion of NATO: With Finland and Sweden now seeking protection from their neighboring aggressor by joining NATO, Congress should act quickly to support the expansion of NATO. Shoring up our defense in the north is good for Europe and good for America. Russia may not like it, but at this point, Putin is an international pariah.  5. Expedite the Aegis Ashore program in Poland: Modeled after a similar installation in Romania, the Aegis Ashore missile defense project in Poland is projected for completion in late 2022. Russia has long objected to the project, but as the Ukrainian attack suggests, the need for missile defense is real. Congress should consider expanding to additional locations in Europe.  Congress should avoid sharing American intelligence with China.  6. Reassess European Military Bases: Congress should reconsider the location of so many bases in Germany, as suggested in a Wall Street Journal piece by Trump National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien and NSC Chief of Staff Alexander B. Gray. "With NATO having moved east, Germany is no longer a frontline state. U.S. forces there, other than those manning hospital facilities and airbases, should be repositioned to outposts in Poland and the Baltics and bases in the Indo-Pacific," they write.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  7. Prosecute Americans who exploited Ukraine: To root out corruption and send a strong message to those who exploited Ukraine, Congress must conduct a serious investigation into American corruption in that nation and other parts of Europe, including Romania. This includes the Biden family dealings.  Regardless of party, political pull, or prominence, those who took advantage of Ukraine should be exposed. Regardless of what happens, the corruption is not going away. To understand where we need to go, we have to recognize where we've been.  8. Put Pressure on the United Nations: As an aggressor guilty of serious war crimes, Russia should not even have a seat on the U.N. Security Council, much less chair it. Congress appropriates more money than any other country to the United Nations. They must bring enormous pressure to bear on that body to expel Russia from the U.N. Security Council.  9. Finally, it goes without saying that Congress should avoid sharing American intelligence with China. It shouldn't have to be said, but the Biden administration apparently believed leaking intel to our enemies was a credible solution to a nuclear problem.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reverberated across the sports world and is affecting the status of Russian and Belarusian athletes who take part in international competitions.  International sporting bodies have cracked down on the countries by either eliminating any mention of them within the competitions or barring athletes from those nations outright as Russia’s unprovoked incursion into Eastern Europe continues.  Here are some of the steps they have taken.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  International Olympic Committee  The IOC disciplined Russia and Belarus for what it called the "breach of the Olympic Truce" over the invasion of Ukraine. The IOC recommended that international sports federations and organizers bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from international competition and prohibit athletes from participating in events under the name of Russia or Belarus.  The new resolutions came after the IOC recommended that sporting events be pulled from Russia and Belarus.  FIFA/UEFA  All Russian international soccer teams and clubs were indefinitely suspended by FIFA and UEFA – the governing bodies for global soccer and European soccer, respectively.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  "Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people," their joint statement read.  FIBA  FIBA, which governs international basketball, announced Russian teams and officials will be barred from FIBA Basketball and 3x3 Basketball competitions indefinitely.  "FIBA strongly condemns violence and hopes peace will urgently prevail," FIBA said in a statement.  International Skating Union  The International Skating Union said it would bar Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in upcoming events until further notice. It means Olympic champion Anna Shcherbakova and embattled 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva won’t see competition.  "The ISU Council reiterates its solidarity with all those affected by the conflict in Ukraine and our thoughts are with the entire Ukrainian people and country. The ISU Council reaffirms its full solidarity with the ISU Members in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Speed Skating Federation and the Ukrainian Figure Skating Federation. The ISU Council will evaluate possibilities for swift humanitarian assistance to its Ukrainian ISU Members," the ISU said.  International Skiing Federation  The International Skiing Federation (FIS) barred Russian athletes from competition. Russian athletes won 11 Olympic medals in Beijing just last month. The organization said it unanimously voted to stay in line with the IOC’s recommendations on Russian and Belarusian athletes.  "To ensure the safety and security of all athletes at FIS competitions, the FIS Council decided unanimously, in line with the IOC recommendation, that with immediate effect, no Russian or Belarusian athlete shall participate in any FIS competition at any level through the end of the 2021-2022 season," the FIS said.  World Athletics  World Athletics, which oversees track and field, cross country running, road running, racewalking, mountain running, and ultra-running competitions, sanctioned Russian and Belarusian athletes as well.  "All athletes, support personnel and officials from Russia and Belarus will be excluded from all World Athletics Series events for the foreseeable future, with immediate effect," World Athletics said.  World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, who won four Olympic medals, condemned Russia’s actions.  "The world is horrified by what Russia has done, aided and abetted by Belarus. World leaders sought to avoid this invasion through diplomatic means but to no avail given Russia’s unswerving intention to invade Ukraine. The unprecedented sanctions that are being imposed on Russia and Belarus by countries and industries all over the world appear to be the only peaceful way to disrupt and disable Russia’s current intentions and restore peace.," Coe said.  "Anyone who knows me will understand that imposing sanctions on athletes because of the actions of their government goes against the grain. I have railed against the practice of politicians targeting athletes and sport to make political points when other sectors continue about their business. This is different as governments, business and other international organizations have imposed sanctions and measures against Russia across all sectors. Sport has to step up and join these efforts to end this war and restore peace. We cannot and should not sit this one out."  International Volleyball Federation  The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) were declared ineligible for international and continental competitions.  "Following the initial decisions adopted by the FIVB to remove official events from Russia, the FIVB Board of Administration has confirmed that all Russian and Belarusian national teams, clubs, officials and beach volleyball and snow volleyball athletes are not eligible to participate in all international and continental events until further notice," the FIVB said.  "The FIVB remains gravely concerned by the ongoing war in Ukraine and its horrific impact on the lives of so many and stand in full solidarity with the volleyball community and people of Ukraine, and sincerely hopes a peaceful resolution can be found urgently."  FINA  Swimming’s international governing body (FINA) said athletes from Russia and Belarus will be able to compete as neutral athletes from neutral teams.  "Until further notice, no athlete or Aquatics official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus. Russian or Belarusian nationals, be it as individuals or teams, should be accepted only as neutral athletes or neutral teams," FINA said. "No national symbols, colours, flags should be displayed or anthems should be played, in international Aquatics events which are not already part of the respective World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) sanctions for Russia.  "FINA remains deeply concerned about the impact of the war on the aquatics community and the wider population of Ukraine. FINA will continue to carefully monitor the grave situation and make further decisions as appropriate."  World Taekwondo  Russian President Vladimir Putin was stripped of his World Taekwondo black belt. World Taekwondo announced that Putin’s attacks on the eastern European nation go against the organization’s motto – "Peace is More Precious than Triumph."  Putin’s status as honorary president and ambassador for the International Judo Federation was also suspended.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  International Tennis Federation  The International Tennis Federation (ITF) cracked down on the Russian and Belarusian tennis federations, barring the countries from ITF membership and team competition. But players are still allowed to compete.  "The International Tennis Federation (ITF) condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its facilitation by Belarus. In addition to the cancellation of all ITF events in those countries, the ITF Board has today announced the immediate suspension of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) and Belarus Tennis Federation (BTF) from ITF membership and from participation in ITF international team competition until further notice," the ITF said.  "The ITF remains in close contact with the Ukraine Tennis Federation and stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine."  The ATP and WTA followed suit. The organizations barred competitors from playing under the Russiand and Belarusian flags. The ATP/WTA combined event set for Moscow in October was also suspended.

The Biden administration's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is one that President Biden considers a unifying force here on the home front, even as inflation soars and Americans remain divided along party lines.  Speaking Wednesday in Superior, Wisconsin, Biden claimed America is "united" even though Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to "split up the United States." Biden said he is "more optimistic about America today" than he has ever been.  Reflecting on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Biden declared, "we are not that country" anymore.  INFLATION NATION: THESE STATES ARE PAYING THE HIGHEST PRICES  "Look, how'd you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament, kill five cops, injure 145… or the German Bundestag, or the Italian parliament," Biden said. "I think you'd wonder. Well, that's what the rest of the world saw. It's not who we are. And now we're proving under pressure that we are not that country. We're united."  Amid several ongoing crises in the United States and abroad, Biden said America "will demonstrate to the whole world no one can split this country" amid Russia's invasion.  Biden's remarks on unity and the American spirit follow a rocky first year in the White House as he still attempts to get a handle on the COVID-19 pandemic. An up-to-date RealClearPolitics average of all the most recent national surveys measuring Biden’s standing put the president’s approval at 40% and his disapproval at 54%.  Biden continues to take heat from Americans over economic burdens, including the high costs of groceries and rising gas prices , which led his own party to introduce a proposal last month to temporarily suspend the federal gas tax in order to help blunt the financial pain of surging prices at the pump. Other costs, including energy bills, are also having an impact on Americans. New York residents say their bills have doubled in the latest wrinkle to red-hot inflation .  SEN. TIM SCOTT: BIDEN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND NATIONAL SECURITY IS SYNONYMOUS WITH ENERGY INDEPENDENCE  Divisive social issues continue to dominate news coverage.  Republicans across the country, including governors and members of Congress, have attempted to push back against what they consider to be federal overreach from the administration when it comes to coronavirus mandates and lockdowns. Conservatives are battling liberals over teaching Critical Race Theory in public schools and banning biological males from competing in female sports, both of which the Biden administration has signaled support for.  Republicans have also lambasted the Biden administration for its failure to secure the nation's southern border, with an estimated 220,000 illegal immigrants evading Border Patrol since October.  "We're going to lower the deficit by a trillion dollars," Biden said in Wisconsin. "These guys talk about how they always are worried about us spending. We're lowering the deficit. No one's ever done that."  Biden's unsubstantiated claims about being a unifier Wednesday echoed those he made in the State of the Union address Tuesday night.  A recent Fox News poll showed that only 31% of voters are satisfied with the direction the country is heading. Additionally, 58% of the poll’s respondents said that the country is worse off today than it was at the same time a year ago.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Biden vowed to unite Americans after being elected, but so far, his efforts have been stifled.

The world is showing its support for Ukraine with the country’s national anthem as the Russia-Ukraine war reaches its first week.  Countless videos of people singing or playing the anthem’s tune with live instruments have been shared on social media as citizens of the world display defiance toward Russian aggression.  Peaceful protestors have sung the anthem at rallies and demonstrations in cities across the globe as have Ukrainians who’ve taken to the streets to fight or have found shelter while Russian Armed Forces continue their attacks.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The anthem has also been played at sporting events, concerts and other gatherings around the world, including a hockey game between the Glasgow Clan and Fife Flyers in Scotland, a Dmitri Shostakovich concert at Bozar Brussels – Centre for Fine Arts in Belgium and Ukrainian opera singer Yuriy Yurchuk in London.  Ukraine’s national anthem — "Shche ne Vmerla Ukrainyina," which reportedly translates to "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet," according to National Anthems Info — is based on a poem written by ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi in 1862.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  The song’s lyrics were taken directly from Chubynskyi’s poem, and it was later composed into an anthem by Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a Catholic priest, according to the national anthem resource.  National Anthems Info reports that "Ukraine is Not Dead Yet" was performed for the first time in 1864 at the Ukraine Theatre in Lviv. The song was a popular tune among high society, but it was discouraged when the Soviet Union took over Ukraine in 1920 following the Russian Empire’s fall.  UKRAINIAN YOUTH GROUPS AND SCHOOLS HOLD PRAYER VIGILS, PEACE RALLIES IN RESPONSE TO WAR  The song regained popularity during World War II and became an unofficial anthem in Western Ukraine. It eventually became Ukraine’s national anthem a little over four decades later when the country achieved its independence.  Ukraine became an independent nation on Aug. 24, 1991. The anthem was formally adopted in January 1992 by legislative officials in Ukraine’s parliament.  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  National Anthems Info reports that slight modifications to the anthem’s lyrics were made in 2003.  Translated lyrics for "Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet" published by Lyrics on Demand — an online song lyric database — describe Ukrainian resilience in face of adversity, which is expressed in seven rhythmic lines.  "Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,  Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.  Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,  And we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.

Export restrictions on technology and software that are currently in place for Russia will be extended to Belarus, in a move that will "significantly degrade both countries’ ability to sustain their military aggression and project power," the White House said.  Russian forces started invading Ukraine from the north through Belarus last week. A referendum was also approved in Belarus on Sunday that revoked the country's non-nuclear status, potentially opening the door for Russian nukes to be deployed in the country.  "Belarus’s choice to enable Russia’s horrific assault on the people of Ukraine has rightly drawn international condemnation," Assistant Secretary of Commerce Thea Rozman Kendler said Wednesday.  The White House also took steps to further economically isolate Russia by hitting the country with export controls on oil refining equipment, which could deprive the country of a key source of revenue over the long term.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The U.S. has declined to ban imports of Russian oil so far, despite calls to do so from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.  "The United States and our Allies and partners do not have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy – which is why we have carved out energy payments from our financial sanctions," the White House said Wednesday.

"Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to menacing ways—But he badly miscalculated," Biden added. "He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall, a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined—he met the Ukrainian people."

The country of usually around 44 million residents is located on the European Plain, meaning that temperatures only moderate slightly during the month of March.  Data provided by the World Bank shows lows are usually in the upper 20s, and highs make it into the 40s on the Fahrenheit scale.  Because of the chilly temperatures, the Red Cross is providing home heating fuels to impacted populations.  The continued cold temperatures have an impact on whether precipitation falls in the form of rain or snow.  Meteorologists say it is not uncommon to see both during March and the frequency of the storm systems can be dependent on whether an El Niño or La Niña weather pattern is in control.  According to the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, an El Niño event typically provides drier than average weather in Ukraine and Europe.  The Climate Centre said droughts during the El Niño years of 2003 and 2007 cost the country around $5.3 billion in damages, mostly centered around the country’s significant agriculture industry.  The Central Intelligence Agency reports Ukraine’s fertile black soil helps produce substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain and other vegetables.  Trade experts say agricultural lands cover around 70 percent of the country.  WEATHER, RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT LEADING TO SKYROCKETING WHEAT PRICES  The world is currently experiencing a La Niña event, which typically increases moisture over the European continent.  As the region progresses towards its annual thaw season, any increase in precipitation could prove to be problematic to transportation.  Ret. Gen. Jack Keane, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and the senior strategic analyst for FOX News, warned in February that unpaved roads could turn muddy and bog down military equipment, especially during the thaw season in mid-to-late March.  Precipitation usually peaks during the late spring and early summer months, but monthly average rainfall amounts are usually below three inches.

Countries are snapping up the rights to "Servant of the People" — a comedy show starring the Ukrainian President, as the Ukrainian President.  Back in 2015, former actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy played Vasiliy Petrovich Goloborodko, a high school teacher propelled to the presidency after a student’s video of him denouncing official corruption in Ukraine goes viral.  Goloborodko sets about running the country while eschewing the perks of being leader by keeping hold of his normal life.  A hit in Ukraine, where it ran for three seasons and a spin-off movie, interest in the show has peaked since Zelenskyy became the face of the nation as it endures attacks from Russia.  A LOOK AT UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY’S ACTING CAREER BEFORE HE ENTERED POLITICS  Eccho Rights has distributed the program, made by Zelenskyy’s Studio Kvartel 95, since it launched. The company’s managing partner, Nicola Söderlund, said sales have increased dramatically in the last few days, calling interest in the program "remarkable."  "It’s quite an old show already," he explains. "But, of course, given the circumstances, it’s become very, very, very interesting for everybody."  Channel 4 has announced it has the rights to "Servant of the People" in the U.K. and plans to broadcast an episode on Sunday, alongside a current affairs show about Zelenskyy. Eccho Rights also reported deals with MBC in the Middle East, Greece’s ANT 1 and PRO TV in Romania, as well as broadcasters in Bulgaria, Moldova, Estonia, France, Finland and Georgia. It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, had U.S. rights.  "People get surprised that a comedian can be a politician, but he was," says Söderlund. "His skills in getting compelling messages to the people, which is what to do if you’re a TV host, has helped him a lot becoming a politician."  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER  Zelenskyy's profile has skyrocketed during the invasion as he is a tireless advocate for Ukraine, appearing with countrymen and on near-constant video addresses. Turning down an offer to escape the country and instead pleading for help made him a hero to many watching.  Eccho Rights has donated 50,000 Euros to the Ukrainian Red Cross, which Söderlund says should offset the money they’ve made from selling the show. The company has also removed any Russian or Russian produced TV shows from its catalog.  Söderlund met Zelenskyy in 2012 when they distributed one of his comedy shows called "Crack Them Up," where ordinary people have to make comedians laugh. The premise of "Servant of the People" appealed to him right away.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Zelenskyy mined the humor of an ordinary man in a corrupt society riding his bike to the presidential palace, forgoing a pay raise and living at home with his mom. "That was kind of the idea," Söderlund said, "and I loved it."  "Servant of the People" won the best feature series award at the Teletriumph Awards in Ukraine and also the Gold Remi Award for Television Comedy at the 2016 WorldFest in Houston.

Richard Childress is stepping up to help the people of Ukraine defend their country against Russia.  The legendary NASCAR driver and team owner has committed to donating one million rounds of ammo to the armed forces of Ukraine.  "I was listening the other day and heard President Zelenskyy say he didn't want out, he wanted ammunition," Childress told Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday.  "I called my good friend Fred Wagenhals, who is the Chairman of AMMO, Inc., which is a publicly traded company, POWW, and I said, 'Fred, we gotta help these people. They need ammunition.' And he stepped right up, he said, ‘We’ll do it,’ and now we’re turning our production to this as our number one priority."  Childress is a member of AMMO’s board of directors and has a persona net worth estimated at $250 million.  "This is a wake-up call for America, and why we have to have our Second Amendment. We have 82 thousand, 82 million gun owners in America, and to see the people in Ukraine fighting — it's terrible to see the lives that are being lost over there," he explained when asked why the cause meant so much to him. "We have to do all we can, and I felt with Ammo Inc. and myself, we were doing the right thing.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  As far as the logistics of getting the ammo to the front lines, it’s not as easy as boxing it up and putting in on a plane.  "We're working with some government agencies, but to get it there quickly, we're going to work through a private company that will be working to get it in there," Childress said. "The number one ammo they're needing right now over there is the 7.62s, and that's what we're going to be producing."  Childress’ NASCAR Cup Series team, Richard Childress Racing, and currently fields cars for Tyler Reddick, who won the first two stages at last weekend’s Auto Club 400 before a flat tire took him out of contention for the win, and his own grandson, Austin Dillon, who finished the race in second place behind Kyle Larson. RCR has won six Cup Series championships since it was founded in 1969.

Cyberwarfare between Russia and Ukraine began well before the first bullets were fired, a cybersecurity expert and former senior CIA official told Fox News.  He also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could launch cyberattacks against America’s supply chain in response to economic sanctions.  "Amidst all the attention on the massive conventional war that's taking place in Ukraine, a cyberwar started before the conventional attack," said Paul Kolbe, the Intelligence Project director at Harvard’s Belfer Center. "It would be still taking place now."  Tuesday marked the sixth day since Russia invaded Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The Russians view the sanctions "as a form of what they term ‘economic warfare,'" Kolbe told Fox News. "They certainly are in a position to launch cyberattacks on targets you might expect and targets you might not expect."  "I'd be particularly wary of attacks on targets that might affect supply chain vulnerabilities," he continued.  "I'd be particularly wary of attacks on targets that might affect supply chain vulnerabilities." — Paul Kolbe, Intelligence Project director, Harvard’s Belfer Center.  Russian attacks on Ukrainian cyber infrastructure and systems so far have fallen short of what Putin expected, Kolbe told Fox News.  JEN PSAKI TELLS FOX NEWS RUSSIAN ENERGY SANCTIONS NOT 'OFF THE TABLE' AS PUTIN'S ASSAULT ON UKRAINE CONTINUES  "Case in point, Ukraine's air defense systems remained online and were countering Russian aviation attacks, helicopter gunship attacks," he said. "The fact that they weren't able to bring down Ukraine's air defense system with just a cyberattack I think tells you that … it's not a perfect weapon."  Kolbe said Ukraine's strong pool of cyber experts has helped the country defend against Russia.  "Many Western companies, supply chains and their back office systems were run out of Ukraine," he told Fox News. "So there's a great deal of talent there."  Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has faced heavy shelling and rocket fire. Earlier this week, satellite images showed a nearly 40-mile long Russian military convoy on the outskirts of Kyiv.  Kolbe said Putin's cyber and traditional warfare missteps were the result of a "massive Russian intelligence failure."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Putin's "services did not warn him of what he was going to face in Ukraine," Kolbe told Fox News. "They provided him with misinformation and disinformation about what the actual state of play is."  Though it may be unclear if Russia is winning the cyberwar, Kolbe said it’s obvious the Ukrainians have won the messaging battle.  "They've been brilliant in their use of social media, in their use of messaging and their use of using the truth to counter disinformation," he said.

The Russian Air Force could soon engage Ukraine at a higher level, a former F-22 fighter pilot told Fox News on Tuesday.  "I think over the next 72 hours, we're going to see a fundamentally different picture for the Ukrainian Air Force, and I'd expect to see more high-level engagement by the Russian Air Force," Dan Robinson, a Royal Air Force veteran and former F-22 fighter pilot, said Tuesday evening.  Overnight, Russia launched the largest air assault of the invasion so far, according to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Wednesday marked the seventh day of the invasion.  Russian forces have increased their attacks on Ukraine's crowded urban areas, including bombing a TV tower in the capital of Kyiv and continued shelling in Kharkiv.  RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST AIR ASSAULT OF UKRAINE INVASION: LIVE UPDATES  However, the airspace over Ukraine is still contested and Ukrainian air and missile systems remain "viable and intact," a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Tuesday.  "The big thing is, though, what is to come? You have to wonder whether the Russian Air Force will emerge over time," Robinson told Fox News. "That's the real question."  ZELENSKYY CONDEMNS RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL: 'BEYOND HUMANITY ... DAMN THEM'  "As to why they haven't emerged so far, there's speculation around the actual capability of the Russian Air Force versus the perceived capability of what they have," Robinson said.  "There's speculation around a lack of sophisticated precision-guided munitions and targeting pods, which allows a certain degree of standoff and to preserve range," he continued. "Without those, they have to get up close and personal, which drags them to within range of things like Stinger missiles that Ukrainian soldiers can operate on the ground."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Robinson said implementing a no-fly zone above Ukraine would lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russian pilots.  "That is extremely problematic in terms of the escalatory nature of what is what this potentially could be," he told Fox News.  President Biden has said U.S. forces will not be used inside Ukraine, and there is no consideration for a no-fly zone.

A human rights expert has warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine would prove a "catastrophe" for religious freedom, considering Russian President Vladimir Putin's record and the record of the pro-Putin breakaway regions in Ukraine.  "If Ukraine falls, it will be a complete religious freedom catastrophe for countless faith communities," Tina Ramirez, president and executive director of the Richmond, Virginia, based human rights nonprofit Hardwired Global, told Fox News Digital. "For evidence, we need look no further than what is already the case in Russia itself and in the Russia-controlled Ukraine regions Luhansk and Donetsk."  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "Media sources, religious freedom activists, the OCU, Muslims, Protestant churches, and Jehovah’s Witnesses stated that Russia-backed authorities in the Russia-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (regions) continued to exert pressure on minority religious groups," according to a 2020 State Department report on religious freedom in Ukraine.  Authorities in the "Luhansk People's Republic" (LPR) have perpetrated a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses as an "extremist" organization, while the "Supreme Court" in the "Donetsk People's Republic" (DPR) upheld a similar ban. LPR and DPR authorities, whom the U.S. does not recognize, implemented laws requiring all religious organizations except the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) to undergo "state religious expert evaluations" and reregister.  According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, most religious groups recognized under Ukrainian law continued to be unable to reregister due to stringent legal requirements under Russian law. All but one mosque remained closed in Donetsk and Russia-led forces have used the religious buildings of minority religious groups as military facilities.  UKRAINIAN BISHOP: PUTIN IS THE ‘ANTI-CHRIST’ OF OUR CURRENT TIME'  "Through Hardwired, the non-profit I founded, I’ve worked in some of the worst religious freedom situations in the world, including Sudan, Nigeria, and Iraq," Ramirez told Fox News Digital. "The religious freedom situation in Russia, Luhansk, and Donetsk ranks right up there with these others. It’s truly abysmal."  Ramirez noted that "many religious communities, such as Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Baptists, Pentecostals, and Muslims, have been subjected to violence, arrested, and had their congregations raided. If Russia takes Ukraine, we can fully expect this evil to continue and spread."  "Freedom of conscience is the most fundamental of our rights and liberties, and it is the foundation upon which our other rights are built," Ramirez declared. "What you think, believe, and hold sacred - these are the things that distinguish us as human individuals."  "It is imperative that we stand tall against the vicious, malevolent forces that work to deny our most basic human dignity and rights," she added.

Another 7.7% of the population identifies as broadly Christian, while Ukrainian Byzantine Rite Catholics make up 9.4%, Protestants make up 2.2%, Latin Rite Catholics make up 0.8%, Muslims make up 2.5%, and Judaism makes up 0.4%. Another 11% declared themselves non-religious or unaffiliated.  According to the U.S. State Department, Russia has used a "disinformation campaign to fuel further conflict" between the Moscow-leaning UOC-MP and the Kyiv-based OCU, which split off from the Russian Orthodox Church in 2019.

Like it or not America is at war with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. It doesn’t matter if the Kremlin tyrant is irrational, ill or crazy – the West faces a credible threat beyond the carnage in Ukraine. To stop Putin, we may be forced to return to the bad old Cold War days of mutually assured nuclear destruction. That policy served us well then and it remains valid today.  President Biden must find the gumption to be crystal clear with Putin and his generals. Tell them to stop escalating the Ukraine crisis to a global stand-off. Then announce to the world that America’s nuclear forces will return to an indefinite high alert status, a necessary move.  This didn’t need to happen but we have no real choice. Yes, we must respond to Putin escalating his Ukraine war to one threatening all the West, almost as if he scripted it for prime time television.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES  Recall, on Sunday he staged a video of himself sternly stating and then commanding Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the Russian General Staff General Valery Gerasimov that "… western countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area … [but] leading NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] countries are making aggressive statements against our country as well. For this reason, I order the defense minister and chief of the general staff to put Russian nuclear deterrent forces on the highest alert."  Some western leaders wonder out loud: Is Putin crazy? Would the Russian really launch a nuke over sanctions and unspecified threats? The answer to the first question is "Perhaps" and the second is a firm "Yes."  Recently we’ve heard reports from people who know Putin. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, "I have met with him many times, and this is a different Putin. He seems erratic… he has descended into something I have not seen before." Even H.R. McMaster, President Trump’s national security adviser, said "I don’t think he’s a rational actor because he is fearful."  These leaders echo what my analysis found by viewing recent videos of the tyrant. The Russian president is void of emotion, always separated from others to include his family, perhaps he’s paranoid or disconnected from reality. His eyes seem devoid of reaction.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ‘HUMANITARIAN SITUATION DETERIORATING RAPIDLY’  The bottom line is no one knows whether Putin is rational, ill or crazy enough to order a nuclear attack, and we have no reason to believe his generals, given their mistakes in the Ukraine war have the courage to refuse the tyrant’s nuclear launch order.  What is not in doubt is the Russians have plenty of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. In fact, there are leaders in both the West and Russia that believe Putin would use his atomic arsenal to get his way.  A few years ago, the former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves asked a panel of security experts addressing the topic "Thinking the Unthinkable" whether Russia would use a nuke. Alexander Vershbow, then NATO’s deputy secretary general, responded: "Yes: a short answer is yes."  Why did Vershbow say "Yes?" It’s not just because Russia has a giant strategic nuclear arsenal – thousands of weapons – and a fleet of bombers, ballistic missiles and submarines to deliver them, all updated in recent years. Besides, Russian nuclear submarines are now drilling in the Barents Sea and mobile nuclear forces roam forests in Siberia, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  It really comes down to Putin’s will to use such weapons to satisfy his ambition to restore the Russian-Ukraine empire, starting with Ukraine. After all, in every recent Russian large-scale exercise such as the 2021 Zapad in Belarus, there was a scenario that included tactical nuclear strikes against NATO targets, what Moscow dubbed an "escalation to de-escalate" concept, a credible threat when one considers Russia has acquired an edge over NATO in tactical nuclear weaponry and platforms like the Iskandar ballistic missile now deployed in western Russia.  Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov, a member of Russia’s parliament, told a 2017 security forum in Slovakia that Russia would use nuclear warfare to deter NATO should the alliance decide to enter eastern Ukraine. So, by that logic, would NATO’s assistance to Ukraine in the ongoing war become a pretext for Putin to launch nuclear weapons?  Putin has already demonstrated poor judgment by invading Ukraine believing that his army would have the upper hand. However, reality slapped him in the face; the Ukrainians are resisting and his army isn’t quickly wrapping up that mission. Is becoming bogged down in an irregular conflict in Ukraine sufficient to go nuclear?  Understand that a "limited" use of nuclear weapons can’t be ignored. Even a small tactical nuclear weapon like a 10-kiloton blast would produce severe damage out to one mile and won’t be ignored by the victims. The problem, according to former US Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, is that "Anyone who thinks they can control escalation through the use of nuclear weapons [of any size] is literally playing with fire. Escalation is escalation, and nuclear use would be the ultimate escalation."  Even Jon Wolfsthal, a former Biden national security adviser warned "… it’s not clear that he [Putin] knows using them [nuclear weapons] against Ukraine would be suicide. So, we need to be pretty clear." However, the White House sees "no reason to change" our nuclear alert level, and Biden assured Americans not to fear nuclear war.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we don’t get a second chance when nuclear weapons start to rain down. War is hard to contain and the Kremlin’s "escalation to de-escalate" concept is pure fantasy. Once the nuclear Genie is out the bottle it’s Katy-bar-the-door – no restraint from the victims of such an attack whether in Ukraine, Latvia or Washington.  At this point Mr. Biden must accept the hand Putin has dealt. Take him seriously and put our nuclear forces on alert. President Biden, with the backing of NATO, you must make it very clear to Putin that ANY use of nuclear weapons will trigger a horrific US response, especially a strike on a NATO country, regardless of the size of the strike.

We are both employees of or advisors to the Global Special Operations Force Foundation, the professional association for special operations, and we understand that we can’t wait until the middle of March for the United States to send aid.  Congress has an opportunity to quickly craft a proposal to send to the president this week. Time is of the essence. The battle for freedom and democracy in Ukraine is happening now and at a critical stage. This is the most consequential war since World War II because the outcome will shape international security structures for the next century, especially in Europe and Central Asia.  UKRAINE WAR: 'FRUSTRATED' RUSSIA COULD SWITCH TO 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' TACTICS, US DEFENSE OFFICIAL WARNS  The conflict in Ukraine is a campaign that can’t be funded piecemeal. The required military material for Ukraine will exceed the $2.9 billion that is proposed in the $6.5 billion request from President Biden. Congress must approve $16.2 billion ($2.7 billion monthly for six months) to cover the required military and humanitarian aid.  Combat operations are coming to a critical inflection point whereby both sides need to replenish supplies to the fighting forces and sustain the civilian populace. The question for both sides is who will run out of supplies logistically first, thus providing either the attacker or defender a substantial, if not decisive, advantage.  The most urgent needs are to resupply the Ukrainians to defend themselves against unrestricted Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Armed Forces and populace are fighting effectively in many places but are outnumbered and often outgunned. The Russians have superior mobility and firepower but lack the essential local knowledge and the will to fight this fight.  Once major cities are surrounded, and the eastern half of the Dnipro is secured, it will become attrition warfare after that. It is a matter of time before Kyiv runs out of ammunition, water, food, power, and civil necessities to keep society functioning.  The United States has the capabilities to provide decisive aid to Ukrainian resistance forces. Ukrainian armed forces and defenders need to have the power, material, and capabilities to deny Russian resupply ground and air routes. They need the capabilities to break Russian encirclement perimeters. They need the resources to sustain the population’s basic needs during the length of the conflict while preparing for Russian occupation. Finally, they need to have the aid to expel Russian invasion forces from Ukraine’s territory.  Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed.  There is a long list of general combat, armed forces, and supporting territorial needs, including ammunition for small arms, crew-serviced, and vehicle-mounted weapons of which the Ukrainian resistance has a need. The resistance needs tank and artillery ammunition of various calibers. They also need anti-tank munitions such as the Javelin missile and launchers with spare batteries, the AT-4, NLAW, and Karl Gustav weapon system.  An aid package should help them secure night vision devices to include individual night vision goggles and aiming devices, and night vision and thermal/infrared sights for crew-served weapons. Finally, they need Stinger anti-aircraft systems, hand-held (secure) communications, small tactical drones, individual protective equipment, field rations, and field medical kits. All of these are immediate military needs that should be sent as quickly as possible to the resistance in Ukraine through reliable supply routes.  There is another bucket of aid in the form of support for the command and leadership in Ukraine. They need secure, long-range communications base stations and associated antennas. There needs to be aid to reconstitute the Ukrainian psychological operations facilities destroyed by Russian missile strikes. Remote portable TVs, radios, and an alternative secure internet communications system that do not have to rely on land-based communications that transit through Russia are needed. Finally, there needs to be an information and broadcast center that can reach into Russia to counter the Kremlin’s disinformation.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  An aid package should designate funds for humanitarian support for Ukraine, Poland and Romania to deal with the humanitarian crisis. Emergency communications, pioneer equipment, hand tools, sensors, urban rescue supplies, temporary shelter materials, use of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance warehouse supplies, and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp sets and kits will help the victims of this aggression.  Resistance forces need aid to be armed and trained with lethal munitions, weapons, secure communications, supporting equipment, secure basing, infrastructure, basic life support for developing, training to support Ukrainian resistance forces. Clothing, equipment, weapons, and ammunition for training and employment should also be a part of the lethal aid provided that should also provide secure communications and transportation capabilities.

The problem with this plan is that it will not be signed until March 11, 2022, at the earliest. That is too late. Without immediate support, the Ukrainian resistance will be doomed.  Congress and our federal government need to move at the speed of war if we wish to see democracy protected in Ukraine. Excessive bureaucratic burdens and processes will potentially cause the provision of this support to arrive late or well after Russia has defeated Ukrainian forces.  Col. (Ret.) Stuart W.

In his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Biden was forceful in denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked, brutal assault on Ukraine. But he should have used the high-profile occasion, and should still do so, to speak directly to one of the few parties that can stop the horrendous slaughter of Ukrainians – the Russian people.  He should say that he does not believe that Russians, who suffered so much in past wars, want their soldiers to invade a neighbor who poses no threat to their country. He should ask them to demand that their president explain why he has launched an all-out assault on a country filled with their relatives and friends, many of whom share a common language, culture and history with theirs. Even Putin has argued, disingenuously, that Ukrainians and Russians are one people.  In fact, Ukrainians have struggled mightily to preserve their own language and culture. But even those whose mother tongue is Russian, among them Ukraine’s Jewish president, oppose the invasion, and have joined the struggle to preserve Ukraine’s independence from Russia.  IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO LEARN THE RIGHT LESSON FROM UKRAINE  Independent polls show that Russians would be sympathetic to such a plea. Recent polls indicate that while 50% of Russians believe that it would be right to use force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO – which was not imminent – more Russians oppose the use of force to unite Ukraine and Russia than support it.  According to Levada Center polling, a well-regarded independent pollster, 83% of Russians have "positive" views of Ukrainians. And 51% said Russia and Ukraine should be independent yet friendly countries.  Although Putin’s popularity soared after he seized Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014, Russians were decidedly less enthusiastic about Russia’s invasion of neighboring Georgia in 2008 and its intervention in the brutal Syrian civil war in 2015. Putin’s popularity dropped following both of those military interventions.

The pain is already being felt. .  The Russian ruble has plunged against the dollar, raising living costs for many Russians. The Russian Central Bank has raised interest rates to 20%, which means that Russians will have to pay much higher borrowing costs. Russians are already queuing at banks, fearing that their credit cards will no longer work because of the sanctions imposed on Russian banks. Biden might remind Russians that their financial pain is the result of their own president’s reckless actions, not the West.

Jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny has urged fellow Russians to stage daily protests, saying Russia should not be a "nation of frightened cowards," and has denounced Putin as "an insane little tsar." More than 6,800 people have already been arrested in anti-war demonstrations. "Putin is not Russia," Navalny said from his jail cell.  Biden should now join him in urging the Russian people to say no to war.

Parks and Wildlife officers in Colorado have removed a mountain lion from a neighborhood in Boulder. A family's pet dog discovered the large cat underneath their back deck and alerted them Sunday morning.  Officers arrived on the scene and successfully tranquilized the mountain lion, according to a statement from the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department. Once it was safe to do so, the officers removed the cat and transported it to a remote area in Larimer County, where it was released.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  CPW Officer Tyler Asnicar, who tranquilized the cat, said, "One factor we look at is location when we get cats that come into town. This one was pretty far east in Boulder in a populated area and it is not a good situation to have a big predator like that close to so many people. It is better for the people and the cat to try to move it. Relocation was our best approach in this case."  MICHIGAN GIVES LIFETIME HUNTING BAN TO MAN OVER POACHING INCIDENT  He continued, "Leading up to this over the past couple weeks, we’ve had several pets taken in town by a sub-adult lion, probably siblings in town. They’ve been spotted a lot in north Boulder. This may or may not have been one of those cats, but increased winter activity is fairly typical as they follow their prey base down, and particularly the mule deer that move into lower elevations this time of year. The cats concentration around the western edge of town and that leads to an increase in sightings and probably led to this cat being in town looking for something to eat."  Asnicar also explained how a cat like this being spotted in a residential neighborhood isn't cause for concern.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "Especially in Boulder, always be aware, but don’t be worried," Asnicar said. "Cats are going to come and go, it is not a new thing and it isn’t going to go away, so know that if you are out and about in town you have a chance of coming upon a mountain lion or other predators as well like bears, coyotes and foxes. So keep an eye on your pets, keep an eye on your kids and teach them what to do if they were to encounter a mountain lion or bear."

Paulina Porizkova is sending a thinly-veiled critique at Instagram after she says the social media app allegedly "censored" her by removing a photo post she shared on Tuesday comparing the spread of misinformation regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The cover model, 56, who is from Czechoslovakia, posted two side-by-side selfie images one of her natural look and another heavily edited to make her appear much younger — which she said juxtaposed the "truth" versus the "filter" represented by dissemination of information centered on the crisis abroad.  "My last post in which I posted these two photos labeled ‘reality’ and ‘propaganda’ just got taken down by Instagram," the widow of Ric Ocasek claimed in the post’s caption. "I went on to talk about what it was like to live under Soviet rule as a child, and being indoctrinated to believe the Soviets were our best friends, and had ‘saved us’ from oppression. In 1968. When the former Czechoslovakia just started to stand on their own."  The supermodel questioned: "What was so offensive about my post that it got taken down? I was speaking about CENSORSHIP with no offensive language used, and I got censored!"  PAULINA PORIZKOVA ALLEGES LATE CARS FRONTMAN RIC OCASEK WAS CONTROLLING: ‘HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO DO ANYTHING'  Porizkova tagged the social platform and added three crying laughing emojis followed by the hashtags "#instagram #censorship #istandwithukraine #standwithukraine."

"In school we were taught that ‘Russians were our best friends, come to liberate us from oppression’. The oppression from whom was never specified," she continued. "Still, as a child, I had been indoctrinated to believe this, and my most fervent wish was to see Lenin in his casket. I recited a Russian poem in first grade in a poetry completion and won first prize - a Russian pen that never worked."  Added the actress and author: "My Babi had to paste a little a Russian flag to all of our windows on the 1st of May every year, to celebrate our "best friends" so she wouldn’t lose her job. Since the press was heavily censored, we only got the news our ‘best friends’ wanted us to get."

"I’m in awe of the Russian citizens protesting this war, putting their lives, their jobs and reputations on the line. I know what the cost is in a country that doesn’t allow for dissent."

Here's another reason why getting up and going for a walk is good for your health.  A new study suggests that staying fit and active into old age can help reduce the risk of dementia or Alzheimer's. The study's results say that being more active could reduce the chances of developing these conditions by a third.  PUTIN'S 40 MILES OF KILLING MACHINES TAUNT UKRAINE'S CAPITAL: LIVE UPDATES  A group of 649,605 military veterans with an average age of 61 were followed for nine years in the study conducted by researchers at the Washington VA Medical Center in Washington DC, the Sun US reports.  At the beginning of the study, none of the participants had Alzheimer's.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  By the end of the study, it was discovered that 9.5 cases of the condition developed for every 1,000 person-years for non-active participants, while active participants saw that number reduced to 6.4 cases for every 1,000 person-years.  The study suggests that walking for two-and-a-half hours a week (a half-hour a day, five days a week) can have a significant impact.  "One exciting finding of this study is that as people’s fitness improved, their risk of Alzheimer’s disease decreased - it was not an all-or-nothing proposition," said study author Dr. Edward Zamrini. "So people can work toward making incremental changes and improvements in their physical fitness and hopefully that will be associated with a related decrease in their risk of Alzheimer’s years later."  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  He continued, "The idea that you can reduce your risk for Alzheimer’s disease by simply increasing your activity is very promising, especially since there are no adequate treatments to prevent or stop the progression of the disease. We hope to develop a simple scale that can be individualized so people can see the benefits that even incremental improvements in fitness can deliver."

President Volodymyr Zelensky released a video of himself and his senior aides outside the presidential office in Kyiv to reassure Ukrainians that he and other top officials would stay in the capital.  The invasion, anticipated for weeks, amounts to Europe’s largest ground conflict since World War II. It could also portend the emergence of a new "Iron Curtain" between the West and Russia, with global repercussions.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Rep. Byron Donalds said Joe Biden's "bizarre" State of the Union address was a result of a "drowning" president trying to save his poll numbers.  "I thought the speech was bizarre," the Florida Republican told Fox News on Wednesday. "What you had is a president who's been drowning, everything he's done is wrong."  "He was grasping at straws and throwing out populist talking points, but there still was no facts or real information behind it," Donalds said.  "In the chamber, his delivery was frankly awful, and the imagery was not good," he continued. "And at the end of the day, he tried to hold onto the actual specifics of liberal policy while throwing out populist points just to save his presidency and to probably save his poll numbers."  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION REPORT CARD: EXPERTS GIVE THEIR GRADES  Biden's speech was the most consequential of his life as U.S. inflation soars and as Eastern Europe devolves into war between Russia and Ukraine. Many members of Congress attending the speech wore small lapel ribbons of blue and yellow to show solidarity with Ukraine.  "It's important for the American people to understand: we would not be in this place right now if Joe Biden had actually led six months ago," Donalds told Fox News.  He said the best part of Biden's speech was the "solidarity with Ukraine." Still, he questioned how "closing off Russian flights to the United States is going to help the Ukrainian people stop the onslaught from [Russian President] Vladimir Putin."  WATCH:  Aside from the international turmoil, Biden's speech also focused on domestic issues, with inflation reaching a 40-year high and gasoline prices hitting their highest level in eight years. In addition, a recent Fox News Poll put Biden's approval rating at 43% – the lowest of his presidency – with 37% approving of his handling of the economy.  STATE OF THE UNION: DEMOCRAT VOTERS GIVE 'A' GRADE TO BIDEN CALLING TO 'FUND THE POLICE'  "The president went through some of the old class warfare talking points about paying your fair share," Donalds told Fox News. "He had the unmitigated gall to tell businesses they have to cut costs, but don't cut wages, just cut costs – and they're not allowed to raise prices either."  "This is someone who is an economic illiterate," Donalds continued. "He doesn't know how businesses actually work and operate and stay open and what allows for a business to hire people and help people earn more money over the life of their careers."  NIKKI HALEY RIPS BIDEN'S 'BIZARRE SOTU REMARKS ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: 'HE FOLLOWED THE EUROPEANS'  Donalds said the state of the union is in "shambles" and pointed to the country's "wide open" borders, rampant inflation and small business owners that are still struggling.  "The state of the union is in crises, a crisis made by Joe Biden," he told Fox News.  The Florida Republican said the U.S. needs to become energy independent to hit Russia's economy.  "Why are we letting the oil and natural gas part of Russia continue to sell oil across the world?" Donalds said.  He pointed to Russia providing nearly 40% of the European Union's natural gas and 7% of the U.S.'s crude oil imports.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "That's why," Donalds said. "If we're going to get serious, we cut off Russia's economy."  "America needs to be energy independent," Donalds added. "If we do that and fully embrace it, we can help our European allies with their energy needs."  Donalds said the U.S. has "more than enough energy resources" in the country for America and its European allies.  Kelly Laco and Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.

As a result, the carrier said its "temporarily suspending" its partnership with the S7. Alaska Airlines customers are no longer able to earn miles on S7. Alaska also said its "ongoing work to enable redemptions on S7 will also stop."  However, the carrier is also suspending its "limited interline relationships" with S7 and Aeroflot. Interline ticketing means passengers can get tickets for competing airlines, in this case, S7 and Aeroflot, if their flight is disrupted by things such as bad weather.  Aeroflot, which is based at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, is the country's largest airline, carrying 4.6 million passengers in the first four months of 2021 alone, according to its website. Meanwhile, S7 is the largest private airline in Russia with an "extensive network of routes" to 181 cities in 26 countries across the world, according to its website.  Both carriers are also part of the Oneworld global aviation alliance, which unites airlines from all continents.

Although the airlines don't fly directly to Russia, some flights pass through Russian airspace in order to get to places such as India or Seoul.  For instance, American re-rerouted its flight between Delhi, India, and New York.

Victoria Spartz, who still has family in the country, warned on Thursday that a "huge humanitarian crisis" will evolve if the international community does not "step up" amid the "destruction of the people."  Spartz, who left Ukraine at the age of 21, talked of friends and family still in Ukraine, including her 95-year-old grandma, who she said are experiencing the attack on civilians in Ukraine. She also noted that it is currently hard to communicate with her friends and family in Ukraine and she is hoping they are safe.  "All of the cities that are under siege get bombarded day and night," she told on "Mornings with Maria" on Thursday as Russia's military claimed to have seized Kherson. U.S. officials tell Fox News that the Black Sea port city of Odesa – Ukraine's third-largest – could come under attack by President Vladimir Putin's army as early as Thursday.  Spartz argued that is important for the international community to provide humanitarian corridors as safety passages to help civilians because a lot of the people who try to evacuate Ukraine are now being "targeted to be killed."  She also argued that going after Russia’s energy and lumber sectors as well as the assets of the oligarchs who were excluded from prior sanctions could stop the "insanity" and the "genocide of the Ukrainian people."  Spartz made the argument as oil prices continued to climb on Thursday morning as shipping and supply concerns continue due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russia's full-blown attack on Ukraine, which started last Thursday, could push energy prices even higher with many NATO countries such as Germany dependent on Russian oil to fuel their countries.  That dependence has limited the international response to Russia's invasion, with sanctions being specifically designed not to target Russian fuel exports amid fears such a move could send energy prices soaring in Europe.  The Indiana GOP representative delivered a passionate appeal to President Biden during a House Republican news conference on Tuesday, stressing that the world needs Biden to stop the "genocide" of the Ukrainian people and if he doesn't step up, the "blood of many millions of Ukrainians will be on his hands, too."  "This is a genocide of the Ukrainian people by a crazy man who cannot get over that Ukrainian people do not want socialism, the Soviet Union [or] communism. They want to be with the United States of America. They want to be free people," a tearful Spartz said at the news conference.  Ukrainians want to fight back, but they need guns, not sticks, she said in urging Biden to provide more aid. She said Biden's sanctions against Russia are too little and too late. Without greater action, Putin won't stop his invasion in Ukraine, and the United States will ultimately have to join in the fight with military troops, she said.  She said Putin struck Ukraine when the United States is weak and urged Biden to step up and show strength.  "He knew that we got embarrassed in Afghanistan. He wants to embarrass us again," Spartz said of Biden during the news conference, referring to the botched withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region.  The final month of America's longest war was mired in controversy, eventually leading to a frantic evacuation effort from Kabul as the Taliban took over much of Afghanistan and closed in on its capital.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  That chaos led to 13 American service members losing their lives during the evacuation effort after a bomb exploded near an airport checkpoint they were manning in Kabul.  A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.  "I think our president needs to grow a backbone during this time," Spartz told host Maria Bartiromo on Thursday, stressing that she hasn’t seen the president act as strong as he should during the "tough times."  "I hope that is going to change because effect a lot of people and a lot of people are going to die if we don’t take some decisive steps and really push President Putin to stop this insanity and, really, [the] genocide of the Ukrainian people," she said.

ORLANDO, Fla. – In his speech to the 2022 CPAC in Orange County, Fla., over the weekend, former CIA analyst and radio host Buck Sexton called for a "housecleaning of the bureaucracy" within the federal government, including health care establishment that imposed Draconian rules and restrictions on Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.  Sexton sat down with Fox News Digital at CPAC for a wide-ranging interview and expounded upon the points he made in his speech.  "The rapid fading of the COVID apparatus and the withdrawal from the constant appearances in the news cycle by the labcoat tyrant Fauci is a direct function of politics," said Sexton, explaining that NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci was used as a "weapon' within the federal bureaucracy – first against President Trump and later against any civilian dissidents of the Biden administration and its policies on that front.  Sexton called the left's mitigation measures "unscientific" and said state governors who refused to impose such mandates ended up experiencing similar or better medical statistics than those who did.  Northeastern governors like Pennsylvania's Tom Wolf, New Jersey's Phil Murphy, Delaware's John Carney, North Carolina's Roy Cooper and West Coast governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Oregon's Kate Brown led the way in imposing forceful and often complex mandates – such as limiting hours of alcohol consumption at taverns in one case -- under threat of fines or other punishments.  South Dakota's Kristi Noem, Florida's Ron DeSantis and Texas' Greg Abbott were seen as governors whose states ultimately fared similarly against COVID in the long term, but unlike many Democrats, did not impose restrictions on their citizens.  "I'm very proud to be one of the earliest outspoken conservatives against all of these measures, recognizing that they had never worked before and there was no scientific basis other than argument and then the suppression of arguments from the other side to believe that they would work now," Sexton said.  TUCKER CONFRONTS NJ GOV OVER COVID MANDATES: ‘I WASN’T THINKING OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS WHEN WE DID THIS'  "This is driven by the political cycle. But then again, I argue, or I would argue that so were vaccine mandates. So were all of the different mask mandates. We've seen so much of what was pushed for COVID started out in the minds of the bureaucrats as something that might be worth trying. … And then it became an issue of political and tribal allegiance."  Many times, once authorities decided on a new mandate, the data on its effectiveness was often ignored, he added, pointing to states where there were no mask mandates.  With the interview taking place prior to President Biden's State of the Union Tuesday, Sexton correctly predicted the White House would claim "some kind of win" after his fellow Democrats in control of Congress lifted the mask mandate in time for the nationally-televised address.  "I would argue that the numbers speak for themselves – more dead under Biden from COVID in the same period of time than in the initial stages of the pandemic without a vaccine from Trump. They cannot change those numbers," he said.  "They cannot change the perception here. Biden on COVID could not be a bigger failure."  Sexton called or Fauci – one of the highest-paid bureaucrats who has worked at the NIH in Bethesda, Md., since 1968 – to be both "repudiated professionally" and investigated by Congress if Republicans are successful in taking back power later this year.  Prior to the State of the Union, many Democratic governors like Murphy, Carney and Connecticut's Ned Lamont walked back their COVID-era restrictions. As Sexton previously noted on "The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show," Lamont drew criticism for claiming Connecticut residents have "earned this freedom".  At CPAC, Sexton said he will work hard to make sure the American people do not forget over the next eight months what Fauci and the Democrats did to them, their families, and their occupations:  "I view it as my mission in life between now and Election Day to remind as many Americans as possible," Sexton told Fox News Digital.  SEXTON: ‘LABCOAT TYRANT’ FAUCI FEELING PRESSURE AS BEAGLE FLIES SCANDAL INTENSIFIES  "And I'm fortunate enough to be on a radio show with millions and millions of listeners, so I think we can have an impact," he said. "My esteemed co-host Clay [Travis], and I, can have a real impact – I view it as my mission in life to remind the American people that the Democrat Party on its own and against all common sense, data, and just basic human dignity, decided to mask, and I would argue, abuse children in schools for months and months beyond any reasonable interpretation of the data."  "I view it as my mission in life to remind everyone who will listen that the Democrats drew circles in parks and told people, 'If you sit in this circle, you're more safe outside from the virus.'"  "It's my mission to remind everybody that there were little footpads in elevators and on escalators telling people to stand six feet apart. And then it was three feet, and then it was 20 feet. And then, 'Oh gosh, we don't even know if this distancing thing did anything' -- And of course it didn't."  Later in the interview, Sexton discussed the Canadian trucker convoy protesting vaccine mandates and government overreach, the response by liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and the way American truckers have been recently inspired to make their own voices heard in Washington.  Last week, a trucker from Biden's hometown of Scranton organized a convoy that traveled down Interstates 81 and 83 toward Baltimore and Washington to encircle the Capitol Beltway "like a boa constrictor."  Since then, a transcontinental convoy set out from California to potentially enter the District of Columbia itself.  Sexton said that it remains to be seen how the California convoy will comport itself in terms of protest. However, as the left-wing protests that often turned violent in 2020 showed, there have been many times Democrats in power have used protests "as a weapon against those who disagree on entirely political lines."  "So, a protest, or even a riot, that has a left-wing agenda attached to it is to be treated as a free-speech exercise even when it's dangerous and burning down buildings and attacking law enforcement officers," he said. "And conservative protest is either shut down on phony COVID, ‘no mass gatherings’ grounds or, in this case, the claims that we saw in Canada about it being some neo-Nazi white nationalist, domestic terrorist threat – that was just the worst kind of lies."  CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Comparing Canadian and American trucker protests, Sexton said that because government overreach and mandates north of the border were present in a much more nationwide context than the U.S. – where many red states in Middle America weren't under the same Draconian orders as on the coasts – it could affect the populist "momentum" of the protests here.  "I think it's very different here because a lot of people live in states that have not been subjected to the same degree of madness," he said.  "It might be harder to get the same kind of momentum as they saw in Canada, where it was really nationwide Fauciism," he added.  "But if they are peaceful, and they are about freedom and individual liberty… then I would stand with them and hope that everyone watches closely to see when the Biden administration is willing to call out men with truncheons and tell them to bludgeon people and when they're not. I think the politics drive that."

Texas congressman and member of the House Armed Services Committee Ronny Jackson on the problem with America continuing to purchase Russian oil and the need to sanction their oil and gas as attacks in Ukraine intensify. Jackson told "Fox & Friends First" on Thursday that the Biden administration should have hit Russia with serious sanctions when troops began amassing at the Ukraine border.  RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR UPDATES: MOSCOW CLAIMS CONTROL OF KHERSON  REP. RONNY JACKSON: Well, they've done a lot of things wrong. They should have put the sanctions in place right off the bat before this happened. Whenever the Russian troops were amassed on the Ukrainian border, we should have had all of these tough sanctions. We should have started by sanctioning their oil and gas. Number one, we should have sanctioned Putin, sanctioned their central bank. All of the big heavy sanctions, some of them which haven't even been done like oil and gas right now. Those should have been done immediately, and the agreement should have been you pull your troops off of the Ukrainian border and stop threatening the Ukrainian people, and we will release the sanctions. But that hasn't been done. We are currently still buying. We, the United States, are buying 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil at over $100 a barrel now and globally, they're getting over a billion dollars a day in oil revenue, selling their oil. It's unbelievable that we're allowing this to happen. We are actually financing their efforts to kill Ukrainians. It's shameful.  WATCH CARLEY SHIMKUS AND TODD PIRO'S FULL INTERVIEW

Attorneys for convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide how to handle disagreements over mental illness-related evidence between capital defendants and their attorneys, an issue that has played a role throughout his case over the 2015 racist slayings of nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation.  When a capital defendant who has been ruled competent to stand trial and his attorneys "disagree on whether to present mitigating evidence depicting him as mentally ill, who gets the final say?" Roof's appellate team wrote in their petition, filed late last month with the high court.  Justices' consideration is "needed to resolve a deep divide among the lower courts over who — client or lawyer — gets to decide whether mitigation evidence will be introduced at a capital penalty hearing."  COURT UPHOLDS DEATH SENTENCE FOR CHURCH SHOOTER DYLANN ROOF  Roof's self-representation and desire to block any evidence potentially portraying him as mentally ill — even if it could have helped him avoid the death penalty — has been a constant part of his case.  During the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial, Roof fired his legal team and opted to represent himself. This move, his appellate attorneys have written, successfully prevented jurors from hearing evidence about his mental health, "under the delusion" that "he would be rescued from prison by white-nationalists — but only, bizarrely, if he kept his mental-impairments out of the public record."  Roof made his decision, his team argued in the petition, "after the district court told him that counsel could introduce evidence depicting him as mentally ill over his objection."  DYLANN ROOF DEATH SENTENCE APPEAL FOCUSES ON CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER'S CAPACITY TO STAND TRIAL  But there is a disconnect, his attorneys argued, between how such cases have been handled in the 4th Circuit versus other jurisdictions, where "the vast majority of state and federal courts hold otherwise, leaving this deeply personal choice to a defendant."  In other words, they argued, "Had Roof been tried in any one of those majority jurisdictions, he would not have been forced to self-represent at his capital trial to block his own attorneys from presenting evidence he abhorred."  Authorities have said Roof opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, raining down dozens of bullets on those assembled. He was 21 at the time.  DYLANN ROOF'S REQUEST TO RECONSIDER RECUSAL IS DENIED  Last year, a panel of appellate judges unanimously upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence and issued a scathing rebuke of Roof’s crimes, which the judges wrote "qualify him for the harshest penalty that a just society can impose."  All of the judges from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers South Carolina, recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case. One of the judges, Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney in 2017, when Roof became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime.  Roof subsequently asked the court to reconsider its recusal. The court denied that request, as well as one for a new hearing.  According to court documents filed in another federal case, the FBI heard two neo-Nazi group members talk about trying to free Roof from the maximum-security prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he is an inmate, including details on the number of guards present and how a shootout would happen.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  If unsuccessful in his direct appeal, Roof could file what’s known as a 2255 appeal, a request that the trial court review the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence. He could also seek a presidential pardon.  The government's response to Roof's request is due by the end of the month.

To understand the Russia-Ukraine war, one must understand the history of communism – and more specifically, Russian communism.  That’s according to Andrew Bremberg, president of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) and former U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.  "Young Americans know very little, and frequently nothing, about Josef Stalin – the brutal leader of the USSR that took over after Lenin and took his crimes under communism and really ratcheted them up," Bremberg said. "I think people know nothing of the Holodomor, which was Stalin's planned famine in Ukraine that killed over 10 million people during the time."  At the time of the Holodomor, known as the Great Famine, when Westerners were suffering from the Great Depression in the early 1930s, socialism and communism were "very much in vogue," Bremberg explained.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "It is a terrible chapter in human history of the 20th century, and the vast majority of young Americans truly know nothing about [it]. Just knowing that one fact, I believe, can really materially change how a person understands communism," he said. "And, frankly, I think it has an effect on how people understand the attacks and crisis today" in Ukraine.  VOC’s mission is to commemorate "the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world" and pursue "the freedom of those still living under totalitarian regimes."  The foundation published a report last year that found an increasing number of young Americans are unaware that some 100 million people have been killed by communist parties in power over the last century, and many are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany.  UKRAINE CRISIS: COMMUNISM VICTIMS ORGANIZATION CALLS RUSSIA'S INVASION ‘ILLEGAL’ AND ‘A WAKE-UP CALL’  While Russia is a socialist country today, Bremberg argued that it is being led by a "dictator" and former KGB leader, President Vladimir Putin, who is "trying to legitimize and rehabilitate the image of Josef Stalin – specifically him as a person – and of the Soviet empire."  "Putin knows the history of communism in 20th century, and if we do not, we are at a significant disadvantage in not understanding what is going on, why it is happening, and … the important historical context for what is happening," the former U.N. ambassador said.  BLINKEN SAYS PUTIN'S RHETORIC ON NUCLEAR THREAT IS ‘HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY’  Bremberg traveled to Europe before Putin invaded Ukraine to meet with heads of state in Romania, Poland and Hungary to discuss the countries’ respective histories battling communism in an effort to "build a relationship" with those countries and better tell their stories here in the U.S.  VOC is building a museum dedicated to victims of communism from more than 40 nations since 1917 in Washington, D.C., and it is set to open in May.  Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, however, the tone of Bremberg's conversations with foreign leaders has shifted. Officials have been reflecting on their own country’s battles against Russia and communism as Ukraine comes under Putin’s fire.  A century ago, the Red Army invaded Poland with the intent of taking over Central Europe, and Polish citizens stepped up during the invasion to help defend the country’s capital of Warsaw, which is reminiscent of Ukrainians defending Kyiv today.  In 1956, Hungarian people helped defend Budapest when Russia tried to invade during the Hungarian Revolution.  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  "We can look at and see lots of parallels to what we're seeing in Ukraine today" when looking at Central Europe’s previous battles against the Soviets, Bremberg said.  RUSSIA HOLDS DRILLS WITH NUCLEAR SUBS, LAND-BASED MISSILES  Much of the dialogue in Europe surrounding the Ukraine crisis paints Ukraine and its citizens in a positive light, and the same is happening in the United States.  Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted on staying in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv as Russian missiles strike the city and a military convoy edges slowly toward the center of the capital, despite an offer from the U.S. to help him evacuate.  In Russia, citizens have risked arrest to protest Putin’s war against Ukraine – something that would not have happened during the Cold War, according to Bremberg.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "It is hopeful, inspiring to see many thousands of Russians protest this war, and that most likely never would have happened under the previous communist regimes," he explained. "[B]ut one difference, frankly, is that I think the regime probably cared or feared a popular uprising, whereas I fear that today that Putin actually just doesn't."  He said he fears "Putin is so isolated and separate" from the Russian people "that regardless of how they may protest," the impact of sanctions – with "Russia being basically cut off from much of the rest of the world" – will be more significant on them than Putin and Russian oligarchs unless further sanctions, such as travel options, are directed toward the higher-ups personally.

Youth groups and schools throughout the country are doing their part to send well wishes to the people directly impacted by the war and protest the clashes that were started by the Russian Armed Forces on Thursday, Feb. 24.  Anna Cirilli, the principal of the St. Nicholas Cathedral School in Chicago told Fox News Digital that students have been organizing prayer vigils to show support for family members and friends who are still in Ukraine.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The students and staff continue to pray for peace for Ukraine," Cirilli said.  In a written vigil excerpt from Monday, Feb. 28, which was provided to Fox News Digital, the St. Nicholas Cathedral School prayed for the safety and protection of all those affected by the war.  "There are people that are protecting their land by fighting in the armed services, volunteer battalions, and militias. These people are heroes, they are the pride of the country for putting their lives on the line for the safety of Ukraine and for all of Europe," St. Nicholas Cathedral School vigil participants said during their prayer. "There are innocent civilians that are paying the price of a war that they did not want. Too many people have become refugees, while others remain in hiding."  UKRAINIAN BISHOP SAYS UKRAINE IS KEEPING FAITH IN RELIGION AND FREEDOM  The prayer vigil participants continued their invocation by noting that families are being separated and are unsure of when they’ll be able to see each other again.  "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not new, but Ukraine is its own independent country with its own history, beliefs, culture, language, and traditions," vigil participants said.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  The Ukrainian American Youth Association – an American branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM), a patriotic and faith-based nonprofit scouting organization – has been spreading awareness about prayer vigils and peaceful protests throughout the country.  Two days before Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv, the Ukrainian American Youth Association had urged its members to contact the White House to honor the Budapest Memorandum and put sanctions on Russia on Facebook. The organization’s call to "help Ukraine" came about after weeks of tension grew between the two countries as Russia built up its military near Ukraine’s borders.  The organization’s Ohio youth chapter CYM Cleveland was one of the first to hold a "Cleveland Pray for Ukraine" event before Russia’s attack, according to a news post from the Ukrainian Youth Association website.

Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern will be in attendance at Taste of the NFL – a pre-Super Bowl LVI culinary experience that aims to combat childhood hunger and food insecurity by raising funds and awareness for vulnerable groups.  Zimmern told FOX News Edge that he got involved with the annual benefit through his work with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization GENYOUth, which has partnered with Taste of the NFL for Super Bowl 2022. The two anti-hunger charities are organizing a ticketed live event at the world-renowned Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb. 12, where food and football will collide.  "Folks can come and participate, come down to interact with incredible chefs and the performance that we're doing with the demos live on stage as well as, you know, have a fantastic party with a purpose to raise money [and] provide hunger solutions for students in schools, which is what GENYOUth now specializes in," Zimmern said in a video interview with FOX. "They're one of the leaders in the country at this, and we're trying to raise as much money as possible."  FRIED HONEY BUTTER CHICKEN BISCUITS FOR YOUR NFL FOOTBALL PARTY: TRY THE RECIPE  He noted that childhood hunger has been exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation continue. These two challenges are especially concerning for Zimmern, who has been a hunger relief advocate for 30 years and has worked with various equity boards, including the New York-based Services for the UnderServed, the International Rescue Committee and more recently the United Nations World Food Programme as a goodwill ambassador.  "I haven't come across a problem that is as deadly and as crisis-filled as the global and national hunger crisis that we are currently enduring," Zimmern said. "I'm staggered by this… To me, it is the biggest head-scratcher of head-scratchers."  Zimmern went on to say that while he’s grateful nongovernmental organizations have stepped up to combat hunger, he wants the world to realize that a society that’s eliminated hunger with nutritious foods is likely to face economic and public health benefits, including less money spent on preventable food-related diseases, an improvement to national security, decreased pressure on the criminal justice system and overall productivity.  FOOTBALL BUTTERCREAM SUGAR COOKIES FOR GAME DAY DESSERT: TRY THE RECIPE  In his own words, "Food is both a tool for understanding other people, and it's also a solution to improving lives both here in America and around the world."  For citizens who would like to show their support for Taste of the NFL and GENYOUth, but won’t be able to attend the live event on Saturday, Zimmern said spreading the word about these two organizations or joining The Virtual Home Gate would be helpful.

SUPER BOWL LVI SNACKING: 5 WINNING DIPS TO SERVE FOR THE BIG GAME  next Image 1 of 2  prev Image 2 of 2  "It's a wonderful way to warm up for the big game on the Saturday beforehand," Zimmern said. "Thanksgiving used to be the biggest food day in America. Number two was Christmas. Number three was Fourth of July. Now, number one is [the] Super Bowl. People watch football at home with their loved ones and they cook.  He continued, "As someone who loves educating, who loves providing adventure and joy in the kitchen and believes in putting food on people's plates, what a wonderful time of year, both to be celebrating food, but also raising money for a fantastic cause and making sure that those that don't have food are provided for."

Zimmern explained that remoulade – a French sauce – had been influenced by Spanish, Caribbean and West African flavors by the time it made its way to Louisiana.  Zimmern makes his recipe with a shrimp boil mixed with mustard seeds, chile fennel, lemon slices, chopped celery and onions, a can of beer and other seasonings, and he lets the ingredients simmer and steep at 200 degrees for 20 minutes or so.  In a food processor, Zimmern makes the remoulade from scratch with chile and Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, eggs, chopped scallions and celery, minced garlic, a spice mix with whole mustard seeds, horseradish, white vinegar and Old Bay seasoning.  Zimmern recommends pulsing the processor a few times before pouring in vegetable oil and letting it emulsify. After the ingredients blend together, the remoulade can be refrigerated while the shrimp cooks.

He then covers the shrimp with ice to trap the flavor. Zimmern serves the shrimp with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, lemon wedges, Cajun seasonings, celery leaves and the remoulade sauce.  "Shrimp remoulade is one of the fastest, tastiest, most delicious treats that you could possibly imagine," Zimmern told FOX.  "I don't think there's a better dish. You [can] do it all ahead of time and simply pour the sauce on right before your guests get there. They can dip if they want. They can plate if they want. You can make a big batch, a small batch. You can do this with other meats or seafood or everything if you don't like shrimp, but I think it's fantastic."

Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619 when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.  Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW  From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.  Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.  Sojourner Truth  Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.  Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.  By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2022: MARYLAND TEACHER KEISHIA THORPE, WINNER OF GLOBAL TEACHER PRIZE, INSPIRES MANY  Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.  Baumfree famously delivered her "Ain’t I a Woman?" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Abraham Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book "The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave" (1850).  Frederick Douglass  Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.  He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.  Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" speech (1852) and "Life and Times of Frederick Douglass" autobiography (1881).  ALVEDA KING REVEALS HOW TO BE MORE LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN 2022  Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education, and the end of capital punishment.  Harriet Tubman  Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.  She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.  Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made "about 13 trips into Maryland" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to "about 70 more," according to the NPS.  By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.  George Washington Carver  Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.  While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.  Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.  YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE  Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.  Ida B. Wells  American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.  Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.  Some of her famous written works include "Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases" (1893) and "Mob Rule in New Orleans" (1900).  Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.  W. E. B. Du Bois  American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.  He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.  Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including "Black Reconstruction in America," "The Souls of Black Folk" and "The Talented Tenth."  Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.  The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that "builds Black political power to end structural racism."  Thurgood Marshall  Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.  He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.  From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.  THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE  Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were "separate but equal."  Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.  His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon B. Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.  Rosa Parks  Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.  At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.  The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.  The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.  She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.  Shirley Chisholm  Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.  In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.  Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director, and educational consultant before entering politics.  Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, where she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.  Martin Luther King Jr.  Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.  He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.  King delivered his most famous speech, "I Have a Dream," on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER  King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954 to 1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.  But it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photographs and video.

A water engineering nonprofit has sent a team to Ukraine's borders and neighboring countries in order to assess the safe water, sanitation and hygiene needs of tens of thousands of displaced refugees.  Water Mission's rapid responders, who are working alongside other humanitarian organizations in the region, are in the midst of determining where the biggest populations of refugees are. Once that's determined, they look into what safe water resources they can tap into, or if any safe water resources exist, in order to determine how to bring emergency safe water systems where they are needed most.  HELPING UKRAINIAN REFUGEES: NONPROFIT DELIVERING THOUSANDS OF HOT MEALS TO PEOPLE IN NEED  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  "As it becomes clear what role we're going to play, then we'll send over all the staff we need to run our response," Water Mission Senior Director Global Partnerships John Peays told Fox News.  Since 2001, the nonprofit has been implementing safe water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions for developing countries and disaster areas. To date, they have helped over seven million people in 57 countries.  One of the biggest areas of need during the current crisis, Peays projected, will be right on Ukraine's borders, where there is a build-up of cars, buses, and refugees on foot trying to escape into neighboring countries.  In fact, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted Monday that some wait times at Ukraine's borders are nearing 50 hours.  During any crisis, Water Missions CEO George Greene said "the need for emergency safe water access is critical for survival."  For instance, Greene told Fox News that "you can very quickly get into a situation where improvised water sources like shallow wells and trying to get water out of the ground, or even people drinking water directly out of rivers and nearby areas… get contaminated with human waste in an excessive way."  It can lead to water-borne illnesses and the worst case is when "cholera outbreaks happen," he said.  Cholera, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a "diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria."  People can get sick once they swallow food or water that has been contaminated with the bacteria, the CDC explains.

A nonprofit has been serving tens of thousands of hot meals to Ukrainians who are stuck in Ukraine or who have fled to neighboring countries.  CHURCHES IN UKRAINE, RUSSIA DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO EMBATTLED CITIZENS  For over a decade, the World Central Kitchen has provided meals to communities in need in the wake of humanitarian, climate and community crises.  When the conflict began to unfold in Ukraine, World Central Kitchen CEO Nate Mook told Fox News that the organization hit the ground running.  "We were watching as families were fleeing across the border into Poland and other countries," he said. "And so immediately we activated our team."  On Friday, the nonprofit, which teamed up with local chefs and restaurants, began serving hot meals at the 24-hour pedestrian border crossing in southern Poland. Since then, they have sent teams to a number of refugee shelters and other border crossings in Romania, Hungary and Moldova.  Mook said the first step was getting his team on the ground, including himself, as quickly as possible.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "We've got meals that are being served throughout the day and all through the night," he said.  They have already distributed tens of thousands of meals with another 25,000 expected to be delivered on Tuesday, according to Mook.  "We're just moving as quickly as possible to get as much food to those that need it," he said.  Mook admitted that it's already been a pretty daunting journey.  "We're talking to a lot of Ukrainians and others who are fleeing Ukraine, and they're traveling for days," he said.  HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE: 3 IDEAS FOR GIVING  Mook said his team met a Ukrainian woman who walked 40 miles just to get to the border of Poland and then waited another 12 hours to cross the border.  In another instance, a young woman from Kyiv had walked two days in order to reach the border into Ukraine without a single hot meal.  "I think pretty much everyone we've been meeting has been in a state of shock," Mook said. "I don't think anybody really expected it to intensify this quickly or have to just literally run away from their homes, sometimes their families and friends."  The nonprofit is also working with restaurants in two Ukrainian cities, Odesa and Lviv, to help feed families that haven't fled.  "We're just here to cover as many gaps as possible," he added. "The most important thing is to appeal to folks who really need them right now."

A Ukrainian American woman who lives near Boston, Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital on Monday that she can no longer speak on the phone with her own mother, who lives in southern Ukraine, because of the Russian attacks on Ukraine and the fear these attacks have engendered.  Many people in southern Ukraine — as well as throughout the country — are right now living in fear for their lives as Russian soldiers overtake the area, the Boston-area woman said.  Babies are being born in the midst of war — "and some of the newborns are dying."  Some people have had their cellphones taken away by incoming soldiers as Russian forces take control of a town and several surrounding villages there, the woman reported.  UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES  Also, the Boston-area woman said she’s become aware of the "humanitarian catastrophe" taking place in Nova Khohovka in Kherson Oblast, in southern Ukraine, right now.  UKRAINIAN FAMILY'S HEARTBREAK AS FATHER MUST SAY GOODBYE TO HIS SON  The Boston-area woman, whose first name is Katya, is sharing what she knows about the events in southern Ukraine with others in the U.S. because she wants more people to be aware of what is happening, she said.  She fears for her mother's life and for the lives of the other people she knows there.  "The town of Nova Kokhovka is surrounded [by Russian soldiers], and several other villages in that area are also occupied," the Boston-area woman told Fox News Digital on Monday morning.  "There has been no water, food or medical aid [for the Ukrainian people there] for two or three days," the same woman told Fox News Digital.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  Also, she said, babies are being born in the midst of war — "and some of the newborns are dying."  The Boston-area woman of Ukrainian descent also told Fox News Digital that in southern Ukraine, "doctors and paramedics are being held captive in hospitals to treat wounded Russian soldiers. They are not permitted to treat local [Ukrainian] citizens."  PRAY FOR ‘THE SAFETY OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE,’ SAYS PASTOR  A Russia expert whom Fox News Digital consulted about the personal narrative as laid out here said that it "rings true" to her.  "When the Russians fight a war, they fight as a ‘whole of nation’ and they attack the adversary as a ‘whole of nation,’ as well," said Rebekah Koffler, author of "Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America" and a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer.  "Unlike Americans," said Koffler, "the Russians do not take serious precautions to keep the civilian casualties low." Instead, she said, "they aim to achieve the mission, i.e. defeat the adversary."  RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE: ‘BABIES AND CHILDREN PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE’  Koffler added, "It’s a different mentality. Having sacrificed 20 million people to fight [against] Nazi Germany [in WWII] and annihilated roughly the same amount during Stalin’s ‘red terror’ period, the Russians have a high tolerance for casualties. In fact, it is part of their strategy and war-fighting style ‘to out-suffer the adversary,’ and to inflict the level of suffering on the adversary that will compel him to abandon the fight."  The slaughtered family members — five people in all — are shown lying on a road outside their car.  She added, "Atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in the Chechen conflict are well documented, plus in Syria (the bombing of hospitals), etc."  ‘Tried to leave’  The Boston-area woman, Katya, said a family "who tried to leave" one of the local villages in southern Ukraine "was killed," she told Fox News Digital on Monday.  Fox News Digital was shown graphic video of the bodies of the slaughtered family members — five people in all — lying on a road outside their destroyed car.  Fox News Digital was also shown video of a dramatic car escape as a Ukrainian family desperately drove away from Russian soldiers who shot at their passing car along a highway.  The Boston-area woman told Fox News Digital that one of the people she knows in Ukraine "managed to hold onto her phone," though many other people there have had their phones taken away or no longer have internet service.  DRAMATIC VIDEO TAKEN FROM SPEEDING CAR SHOWS UKRAINE DEVASTATION  The woman is "traumatized" by the violence her relatives are suffering, another Ukrainian American in the U.S. who knows her told Fox News Digital. This other woman is also fearful for the safety of Ukrainians right now as they endure the Russian attacks.  John Wayne Troxell, former Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (retired), told Fox News Digital on Monday in a phone interview that the members of the Ukrainian armed forces that he knows are continuing to "stand and fight" against the Russian invaders.  In so doing, he said, "they are following the lead of their military leadership — they're going to stand and fight to the death for their country."  UKRAINE'S CHILDREN: HOW TO HELP VULNERABLE KIDS AMONG RUSSIA'S ATTACK  It is "so admirable," he added, that these Ukrainians are standing strong for their country — "and not just those in the military, but the citizens."  He also said, however, that those he knows in Ukraine are aware they will have very tough nights ahead of them — including this week.

Dramatic photos shared with Fox News Digital on Monday show one family's almost unbearable heartache as a Ukrainian father is forced to bid his tearful young son goodbye, telling the child, "Be brave for your mother."  The man was sending his family off to Hungary from a local train station in Ukraine, The Mirror reported.  The man's goal was to get his beloved family — his wife and two children — away from the danger and chaos of war as Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces continue to push their way into Ukraine in an all-out assault on that country.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  The father and son are shown hugging and saying a painfully emotional goodbye to each other at the Lviv Train Station.  The dad, Ruslan Gladkiy, gave his nine-year-old son, Hordeiy, a big bear hug as he put him, his daughter and wife on a train in Lviv, the report noted.  Young Hordeiy was so overtaken with emotion in the moment of having to part with his father that he had to take off his glasses.  The father expressed how "very difficult" the moment was for him as well.  "I did not want to say goodbye to my family. They are going to Hungary," he told the outlet.  "We live 250 kilometers [about 155 miles] from Lviv and I drove them here this morning to get the train," the father also said, the report noted.  He added about himself, "I am staying."  IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR, ‘BABIES AND CHILDREN PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE'  Numerous families throughout Ukraine have been torn apart by the war begun by Russia, according to many other reports.  In addition, scores of Ukrainian Americans all over the U.S. are expressing their outrage, upset and concern for family, friends and colleagues who are still in Ukraine and who are facing grave danger.

Until recently, BNPL wasn't included in credit reporting, which meant that these borrowers didn't benefit from making on-time payments.  That changed earlier this year when Equifax became the first credit bureau to include BNPL payment information when calculating credit scores. And on Feb. 24, TransUnion followed suit by introducing a new feature that allows users to add their BNPL plans to their credit history.  "The inclusion of point-of-sale loans including BNPL into credit reports and other risk management tools can help tens of millions of consumers gain access to more credit opportunities and potentially secure better loan terms," TransUnion Senior Vice President Liz Pagel said.  TransUnion users must opt in to add BNPL tradelines to their credit profile. As a default, credit report delivery to existing scoring models will remain unaffected.  Keep reading to learn more about how BNPL will impact credit reporting, as well as what you can do to improve your credit score.

BEST SHORT-TERM LOANS: COMPARE YOUR OPTIONS  BNPL in credit reporting will ‘maximize financial inclusion’  Up to 100 million Americans have used a BNPL service at least once in the past year, TransUnion reported. And millennials and Gen Z consumers are utilizing this financing option at high rates — a third of BNPL applicants are between the ages of 18 and 30.  Including BNPL payment history in credit reporting could benefit these young consumers with thin credit files by giving them a way to start building and improving their credit.  "Maximizing the financial inclusion impact requires broad usage of this valuable data in more credit decisions." - TransUnion Senior Vice President Liz Pagel  However, consumers may not begin reaping the benefits until BNPL loan data is widely used by financial institutions and lenders. Credit reporting companies need time to build BNPL payment data in their future underwriting, TransUnion reported.  For example, VantageScore is "working rapidly" to incorporate BNPL installment loans into its scoring models, according to the company's president and CEO, Silvio Tavares. Additionally, FICO is still determining "the best approach for inclusion of BNPL data," Sally Taylor, vice president at FICO Score, said.  Long term, TransUnion said it expects that adding BNPL consumer data will help some borrowers improve their credit score. In the short term, though, consumers may need to look for alternative ways to boost their creditworthiness. You can begin building your credit score by enrolling in credit monitoring on Credible.  HARD CREDIT CHECKS VS. SOFT CREDIT CHECKS: WHAT TO KNOW  Short-term ways to improve your credit score  There are several long-term ways to boost your credit score, such as improving your on-time payment history and building your average age of credit over time. If you're looking for short-term solutions to improve your credit score, consider these strategies:  Check your credit report for errors.

Between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing cyberattacks, experts are warning about malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S., and some U.S. security pros spoke to Fox News about how to defend against technological assaults.  Russia is not likely to take President Biden’s new sanctions sitting down and has proven to be highly adept at cyber warfare, which has become part and parcel of active "kinetic" wars in the 21st century.  "This is not something to take lightly — cyber attacks don’t have borders," Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a tweet.  "I remain particularly concerned about the reports of cyber attacks…There’s historical precedent to suggest these could be devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire countries," Warner said in another tweet.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  Russia has already launched what appears to be a series of cyberattacks on targets in the Ukraine. This past week, cyberattacks impacted the websites of several Ukrainian government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, according to Ukrainian officials. This follows cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites and banks that have been attributed to the Russian military spy agency GRU.  How to defend yourself from Russian cyber warfare ‘spillover’  As Sen. Warner suggested, cyberattacks don’t have borders. As a result, cyber spillover campaigns could reach the U.S.  "With the Ukraine conflict now front and center and poised to widen, we expect a surge of cybersecurity attacks from Russia state-sponsored organizations," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, told Fox News in a written statement.  Here’s what to watch out for and how to defend yourself, according to cybersecurity experts that Fox News spoke with.  --Ransomware: The bane of InfoSec professionals, ransomware attacks lock out companies and individuals from critical data. Attackers then demand hefty payments. "Businesses across the U.S. should be bracing for a variety of cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware," said John Dickson, vice president at Coalfire, a Westminster, Colorado-based provider of cybersecurity advisory services.  "Make sure that all critical and all internet-facing systems are fully patched to mitigate ransomware and data destruction," Lou Steinberg, cyber expert and founder of CTM Insights, told Fox News. "Use multi-factor authentication to log in to critical systems … and to prevent unauthorized changes (like turning off power or opening a valve on a dam)," Steinberg said.  --Denial of service attacks: Denial of Service, which renders critical computer services unavailable, and ransomware attacks are often "outsourced," according Steinberg. "Rather than the government directly performing them, they tend to be done by groups who believe they are being patriots by defending Russia's interests. It’s in [that] government's interest to enable this as it gives them deniability. You can’t trace an attack back to the Kremlin," Steinberg explained.  These outsourced actors "may be less capable" so companies can protect themselves if they take prudent cybersecurity measures, according to Steinberg.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: UKRAINE TO GET $350M MORE IN US DEFENSE AID: BLINKEN  --Social engineering campaigns: These attacks manipulate human behavior and "piggyback off of the news cycle," said Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions, at Lookout, a San Francisco, Calif.-based endpoint-to-cloud security company.  "Be especially vigilant about where you’re sharing data, who has access to it and the identity of anyone with whom you have interactions online," Schless said.  --Passwords: Consumers should always use multi-factor authentication and avoid reusing the same password across accounts/services, Alex Ondrick, director of security operations at BreachQuest, an Augusta, Georgia-based incident response company, told Fox News.  Ondrick said consumers can use sites like haveibeenpwned to see if they’ve been impacted by a security breach. "Regularly rotate passwords, especially on email/social media accounts, and for Wi-Fi and home router(s)," Ondrick said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  --Banking apps: "Consumers should be on the lookout for phishing and malware attacks, especially when accessing banking apps," Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said. Consumers should use antivirus products as well as software that protects their identities, Ives added.  --Software updates: For individuals, it is important to follow cybersecurity best practices. That includes "installing recommended software and app updates, backing up their data and exercising caution when clicking links in emails, social media posts and online articles," Jonathan K. Osborne, a business litigation attorney at the Florida-based Gunster law firm, told Fox News.  --FBI: The FBI has a Cyber Threat website with tips and preventative measures on everything from email compromise to phishing and ransomware.

As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.  The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.  "Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred," FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.  Shah tells FOX News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal. Several parodies of Tom Cruise and other actors exist online.  TOM CRUISE DEEPFAKES ON TIKTOK POINT TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REALISTIC PHONY VIDEOS  The FBI gets involved if the video violates any federal laws, like extortion or fraud. Shah gave FOX News example of the voice of a company executive being manipulated.  "The same inflection. The same accent, and they make a phone call and you can ask the employee as the CEO, to wire that money."  A similar situation happened in Hong Kong as part of an international heist that is still under investigation.  While the FBI won't specifically comment on deepfakes as part of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, other intelligence sources say they are on the lookout for altered videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key players.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  "I think we are just starting to see the tip of the iceberg on these," cyber expert Matthew Canham told Fox News of deepfakes.  Canham has a stern warning for the public.  "I think it's probably wise to check everything that you see," he said. "Probably the more emotionally provocative it is, the more important it is to confirm the sources."

Archbishop Borys Gudziak says Ukrainians are keeping their faith in religion and democracy alive as the country continues to battle the Russian invasion.  Gudziak, who is a spiritual leader at the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy in Philadelphia, joined "Fox & Friends" on Tuesday to discuss the strength and unity Ukrainians are displaying as the war goes on.  UKRAINE REFUGEES TO RECEIVE HELP FROM FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S HUMANITARIAN AID NONPROFIT  "We’re beginning Lent, and Lent leads us to the resurrection," Gudziak said during his televised interview. "There’s the way of the cross in between and Ukraine is being crucified right now."  He continued, "But, people are strong. People believe that God is the lord of history, and they’re putting up a fight."  Gudziak noted that Ukrainian armed forces have not allowed Russia to advance and have shown great resilience even with its smaller budget and fleet of tanks and planes.  UKRAINE ASKS TWITTER USERS TO SPAM RUSSIA WITH THOUGHTS ON THE WAR: 'TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK'  "Two hundred thousand volunteers have signed up in the last five days for the [Ukraine] Territorial Defense Unit," Gudziak said. "They’re of strong faith. There’s unity. Ukrainians are united. They’ve united the world."  "You know, [Russia’s President Vladimir Putin] thought the war would be over by Saturday," Gudziak told "Fox & Friends," while citing alleged reports of a Russian news outlet that seems to have accidently published a premature victory article.  ASH WEDNESDAY, START OF LENT: WHEN ‘WORLD IS A MESS,’ WE MUST ‘TURN TO GOD’  "It’s not happening, and it won’t happen," Gudziak continued. "Every hour-to-hour, the resolve of the country is getting stronger. It’s really freedom or death."  PRAYERS FOR UKRAINE: AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS SHARE THEIR FERVENT CONCERNS  Gudziak went on to say that Ukrainians of faith know they have a life on earth and strongly believe in an eternal life after death.  From his point of view, this knowledge and belief have led Ukrainians to fight for freedom because many feel it’s important to "stick to principles" and "make big sacrifices" when times call for it.  "Ukrainians really are being punished because it’s a democracy," Gudziak said. "It’s a place for the freedom of the press, it’s a place where people have freedom of religion, and this is what the autocrats fear. And Putin does not want this virus to spread to Russia."

The bald eagle population is being poisoned by lead at an alarming rate.  Across the U.S., bald and golden eagles are repeatedly exposed to lead, according to new research. The study sampled more than 1,200 birds in 38 states and found that 46% of bald eagles and 47% of golden eagles have chronic lead poisoning.  Scientists believe eagles consume trace amounts of lead when they scavenge the animal remains left behind by hunters that used lead bullets.  The effects of lead poisoning can be deadly for birds and even slow the rate of population growth.  "What we saw in association with this lead exposure is population growth rates in bald eagles are being suppressed by 4% and 1% in golden eagles," said Vince Slabe, a wildlife biologist and co-author of the new study. "In a stable population, any suppression of this growth is of concern."  The study’s findings could signify a potential setback for the bald eagle, which was endangered from 1978 to 2007. Bald eagles were near extinction by the 1960s because of a now-banned pesticide called dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Since then, the bald eagle population has soared to more than 300,000 birds in the wild today.  Todd Katzner, a conservation ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and co-author of the new study, told Fox News the bald eagle population is still thriving despite the threat of lead poisoning. Katzner said golden eagles may not fare as well.  RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES  "The bald eagle population is growing rapidly in North America," Katzner said. "But golden eagle populations are stable or declining at best, their populations are at about 30,000 … any amount of suppression is something that is going to raise eyebrows.  The findings of the study have renewed calls among conservationists, pleading with hunters to use non-lead ammunition. The federal government banned lead ammunition in hunting waterfowl in 1991. A number of states enforce their own regulations on top of that. California banned the use of lead bullets by hunters 2019.  2021 WAS SAFEST HUNTING SEASON EVER FOR THIS US STATE  Chris Parish, president of the Peregrine Fund, believes most hunters don’t know about the toxic effects of lead. He co-founded the North American Non-Lead Partnership to educate hunters and encourage them to voluntarily switch to alternative ammunitions that don’t use lead – like copper bullets.  "Hunters are the only way to solve this problem, and the best way to appeal to a hunter is to work with them not work against them," Parish said.

PETA MURGATROYD PLEADS FOR MAKSIM CHMERKOVSKIY’S RETURN AFTER RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE: ‘PLEASE PRAY’  Asked how she feels about the Biden administration's response to the horrific loss of lives taking place in Ukraine, she said she believes it's "incredibly early on" and not the time to pass judgment.  "One can only hope that they have learned their lesson after what we saw in Afghanistan and take proper action this time.  "The United States was challenged in a similar way during the Cuban missile crisis. What we should hope for and expect as Americans is that our country and this administration can live up to the courage, creativity and determination of the Kennedy administration and respond correctly to what we are seeing," the model continued.  CELEBRITIES REACT TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT: 'MY HEART HURTS'  Silence is not the answer  The crisis has prompted several celebrities, especially those with Ukrainian and Russian heritage, to speak out and call for an end. Many have shared the disbelief that war is occurring in 2022. Pipko declared this is another moment in history where silence is not the answer.  "I am always of the mindset of speaking up for what you believe in. At the least, that is what the Ukrainian people should expect from all of us today," she said.

As Martin Luther King said, ‘In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.’ Silence is not only incredibly dangerous, but unacceptable when so much is at stake," Pipko concluded.  Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, including Kyiv, overnight Wednesday that Russia called a "special military operation."  President Biden announced new sanctions on Russia and the deployment of 7,000 more U.S. service members to Germany while maintaining that U.S. military will not fight in Ukraine.

The Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant winner this year is a St. George local, and she was not the only Utahn to shine at this year’s competition in Las Vegas.  Marianne Hamilton has been involved in the Southern Utah community for more than 10 years, leaving her mark on several organizations, the Spectrum newspaper reported. Since moving here from Northern California in 2014, Marianne and her husband Doug have become heavily involved in the Huntsman World Senior Games. Marianne discovered her love of athletics through participating and being a race director over the years.  It was her involvement with the Huntsman World Senior Games that led to her competing in the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant in 2019.  MISS AMERICA PAGEANT TURNS 100 YEARS OLD  "We were at nationals and this woman was greeting the athletes, and she was wearing a gown and her sash said Ms. Senior Utah, and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting.’ So I talked to her just real briefly," Hamilton said. "And then I ran into her again ... at another Senior Games event here. And we talked more, and she explained to me about senior pageantry and how it empowers women over 60 to still be out there and still give back to their community."  After looking into the website and speaking with the pageant director, Hamilton decided to compete in 2019.  Hamilton was diagnosed with breast cancer during her time between the 2019 and 2020 pageants.  It was an experience unlike anything she had previously had, but Hamilton said there were similarities between the senior athletic competitions and the senior pageantry. Both competitions focus on accomplishments in older people.  WOMAN DROPS 112 POUNDS, WINS BEAUTY PAGEANT AFTER FIANCÉ DUMPED HER FOR BEING TOO FAT  "I see very, very similar parallels between the Senior Games and being in the Senior Universe Pageant. And I think both are about a refusal to accept that age dictates boundaries," Hamilton said.  The Ms. Senior Universe Pageant focuses on competitors’ ability to show their accomplishments and how they portray themselves. There is no bathing suit competition. Instead, there are several days of questions and other ways for competitors to distinguish themselves.  One thing Hamilton excelled at was the writing portion of the competition. She is a journalist for St. George Health & Wellness Magazine and the St. George City Lifestyle Magazine.  "There was a lot of writing involved, which was kind of to my strengths, which was nice," Hamilton said. "You have to write several times; I had to write introductions for the judges to read. And you need to write out your philosophy of life and be able to recite that from memory within 30 seconds. There are a lot of photographs to gather and a lot of reflections about your life."  CHIHUAHUA BEAUTY PAGEANT GETS MORE THAN 800 COSTUMED PARTICIPANTS: SEE THE PHOTOS  With Hamilton turning 70 this year, the Ms. Senior Universe/USA Pageant was a way to start the year with a big bang. She said she planned to perform her duties as Ms. Senior Universe USA while continuing to write and race.  "It’s really thinking about the fact that whatever age you are, you deserve to be celebrated," Hamilton said. "And the more years you have on Earth, the more cumulative experience as you bring to the party."  Hamilton said that when she started she wasn’t expecting to get breast cancer in between competitions, but she learned from the experience.  "I’m here to tell you that it’s not a death sentence," she said. "And those kinds of things all go into making you a stronger person, and maybe able to help other people who are going through it."

Jeanene Burton, a teacher in St. George for over 30 years, also was in the competition and won the "best gown" award.

The White House announced the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan on Wednesday, which the administration says aims to move the nation forward safely and build on progress two years after the pandemic first hit.  At the White House COVID-19 response team briefing, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients touted the plan – the result of weeks of work with experts both inside and outside of government – as "robust and comprehensive."  "Today we have the tools we need to protect each other and treat COVID-19," he said. "They're widely available for the American people. And, with Congress' help, the president's plan will make sure that's always the case."  BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS  Echoing comments made by President Biden, he said that the administration would be prepared for the rollout of vaccines for children under the age of 5 years old.  He also referenced the "Test to Treat" initiative the president announced at his State of the Union address Tuesday night, and the effort to make more free at-home COVID-19 tests and N95 masks available.  "Test to Treat" allows for Americans to get tested for coronavirus at a pharmacy and receive antiviral pills "on the spot at no cost" if they are positive.  "Vaccines, treatments, tests, masks – these tools are how we continue to protect people. They enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines," he noted. Zients added that the government will launch a website to ensure Americans can find tools at convenient locations later in March.  Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra later highlighted that the government has, thus far, distributed 690 million doses of vaccines, 4 million treatments, more than 270 million free N95s and free COVID-19 tests to 70 million households.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), he said, would further expand research and ramp up data sharing, with the possibility for launch new centers should Congress provide funding.  Becerra said the administration would coordinate a "whole of government effort" to support children and families who have experienced the loss of loved one due to COVID-19, as well as focus on strengthening mental and behavioral health services.  The secretary said HHS would continue to address the specific needs of seniors, people with disabilities and those who are immunocompromised.  NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED  The 96-page National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan focuses on four key goals, including protecting against and treating the disease, preparing for new variants, preventing economic and educational shutdowns and continuing to lead the effort to vaccinate the world.  Zients said that the U.S. variant monitoring system is ready to respond and can now detect variants at a "very low level."  He said the plan would create stockpiles of personal protective equipment, tests and treatments and said that the plan would continue to ensure that schools, workers and workplaces have the resources they need.  That includes a new clean air in building checklist from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a request for Congress to reinstate tax credits to help small and mid-sized businesses with paid sick and family leave.  Lastly, Zients said that the president's plan includes continuing to donate more vaccines worldwide and "doubling down on efforts to turn those vaccines into vaccinations."  To date, more than 215 million Americans are fully vaccinated and two-thirds of eligible U.S. adults have received a booster shot.  As Zients pointed out, the plan requires Congress to invest in tools and the plan pushed against the idea of just "living with COVID."  "Make no mistake, President Biden will not accept just ‘living with COVID’ any more than we accept ‘living with’ cancer, Alzheimer’s, or AIDS. We will continue our work to stop the spread of the virus, blunt its impact on those who get infected, and deploy new treatments to dramatically reduce the occurrence of severe COVID-19 disease and deaths," it said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The president said Tuesday that his administration would never give up on vaccinating more Americans and would leave no one behind.  Vaccines could be deployed within 100 days in response to a new variant and Biden said he would soon send a request to Congress.  "We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life …" he said. "… We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward – on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together."

BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS  He also highlighted that vaccine-maker Pfizer Inc. is currently "working overtime" to get Americans a million pills in March and more than double that number in April.  A White House official said the plan will roll out at hundreds of pharmacies nationwide, including CVS, Walgreens and Kroger locations.  His administration is also making more free rapid COVID-19 tests available to order at covidtests.gov – even for those who already ordered some from the federal or U.S. Postal Service websites – beginning next week.  The government has sent more than 270 million free tests to nearly 70 million households since mid-January, with nearly half of the 500 million still unclaimed.  "Tonight, I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines," Biden said. "It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again."  The White House is planning to release a new "National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan" on Wednesday that officials said would be a "roadmap" that will enable the country to "move forward safety."  According to The New York Times, the plan is expected to address developing new vaccines and therapeutics, how to keep businesses and schools open, and a host of other issues.  NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED  In his speech, Biden also noted the U.S. must be prepared for new variants.  Echoing comments made by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, the president said new vaccines could be deployed within 100 days, if necessary.  "I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But, I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does," he stated, also calling on Congress to provide renewed funding for tests, masks and pills.  Additionally, White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients informed governors Tuesday that Biden is approving the extension of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support.  "FEMA’s priority throughout the response to COVID-19 has been to coordinate and provide the necessary resources and personnel states, tribes and territories need to adequately respond to the pandemic," FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said. "Today’s extension of the 100% cost-share through July 1, 2022, builds on our efforts to assist impacted communities across state and federal levels."  While COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have plummeted since January's omicron variant peak, deaths remain elevated.

President Biden on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle the nation's mental health crisis as part of the "Unity Agenda for the Nation."  In addition to boosting mental health, the initiative includes fighting the opioid epidemic, helping veterans and ending cancer.  BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TOP 5 MOMENTS  The president noted in his State of the Union address that schoolchildren have been especially impacted because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.  "The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning," he said. "I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part – sign up to be a tutor or a mentor."  He also called for the strengthening of privacy protections on social media, a ban on targeted advertising to children and demanded that tech companies stop collecting personal data on children.  Biden said the nation "must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit."  He pointed out that children were struggling due to social media harms, bullying, violence and trauma before the pandemic.  "Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care," he said.  Earlier Tuesday, the White House wrote in a release that two out of five adults report symptoms of anxiety or depression, with Black and Brown communities disproportionately undertreated.  NEARLY HALF OF BIDEN'S 500M FREE COVID-19 TESTS UNCLAIMED  Grief and trauma from the pandemic – fueled by losses and disruptions in routines and relationships – have "driven Americans to a "breaking point," with adolescents particularly affected.  The administration said the president's mental health strategy will aim to strengthen system capacity, connect more Americans to care and create a continuum of support.  To do so, the government plans to strengthen crisis response infrastructure and expand the supply, diversity and cultural competency of the mental health and substance use disorder workforce.  The White House said it would invest in proven programs that bring providers into behavioral health, pilot new approaches to train a diverse group of paraprofessionals, build a national certification program for peer specialists, promote the mental well-being of frontline health workers, launch a "988" mental health crisis service hotline, expand the availability of evidence-based community mental health services and invest in research on new practice models.  In order to connect Americans to treatment, it also intends to expand and strengthen parity, integrate mental health and substance use treatment into primary care settings, improve access to same-day mental health care for veterans, expand access to telehealth and virtual mental health options and support in schools, embed and co-locate mental health and substance use providers into community-based settings and increase behavioral health navigation resources.

The administration will increase mental health resources for justice-involved populations, work to set students up for success in school, expand early childhood and school-based intervention services and supports, train social and human services professionals in basic mental health skills, invest in social media's mental harms, put a stop to discriminatory algorithmic decision-making and institute stronger online protections for young people.

EARLIER REPORT  Russia is making demands to OneWeb, a partially UK government-funded satellite company, before it will launch the dozens of spacecraft manufactured at a facility near Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  This week Roscosmos was set to launch 36 OneWeb internet satellites from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan; however, after the Soyuz rocket was rolled to the launchpad Roscosmos issued the following statement in Russian:  "Roscosmos demands guarantees OneWeb satellites not to be used for military purposes.  Because of Britain's hostile stance against Russia, another condition for the March 5 launch is that the British government withdraws from OneWeb."  The standoff situation comes in response to sanctions imposed by the UK against Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have also used sanctions to devastate the Russian economy.  OneWeb has a satellite manufacturing facility in Merritt Island outside the gates of Kennedy Space Center, where it employs about 100 people. The 100,000-square-foot facility can manufacture up to two spacecraft a day that otherwise would take years.  RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE PUTS US-SPACE COLLABORATION IN QUESTION  Like SpaceX’s Starlink constellation, OneWeb plans to provide high-speed internet using satellites in low-Earth orbit.    Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, appeared in a video on Russian state media saying that OneWeb has until March 4 at 9:30 p.m. local time in Moscow to meet the demands of the Soyuz rocket will not launch.  Don Platt, Florida Institute of Technology associate professor of space systems and the director of the Spaceport Education Center, said these demands are "nonstarters."  "[OneWeb] can't just go out and ask one of their main investors to no longer be involved with them because of a launch provider's demands and contracts have already been signed and put in place for this launch that was supposed to happen this week," Platt told FOX 35 Orlando. "So those aren't things that you can just suddenly come up with on the last minute, several days before the launch."  The UK government bought into OneWeb in 2020 when the company was bankrupt.  UK Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote in a tweet that the UK government is not selling its share in OneWeb.  "There's no negotiation on OneWeb," Kwarteng said.  According to Platt, this strategy will likely be more damaging to the Russian space program than to anyone else.  "It would certainly damage the long-term credibility of using the Russians for commercial launches," Platt said.  The Russian demands could also benefit private space companies.  SEEN FROM SPACE: HOW THE GOES-T LAUNCH LOOKED FROM 22,300 MILES AWAY  "There’s going to be a tremendous amount of people all over, whether it's in Europe or the United States, [who] will no longer have an interest in doing business with Russia, certainly in the space industry as well," Platt said. "There's no reason to go over to Russia anymore; it used to be that those were great deals and bargains. But now you can get bargains in the U.S. launch industry."  The impacts of sanctions and flight bans to and from Russia put in place by the U.S. and its allies because Putin invaded Ukraine could have longer-term effects on the Florida satellite manufacturing facility and the space industry as a whole.  OneWeb has selected Russia to launch about 19 missions.    During his State of the Union Address, President Joe Biden said the U.S. would join Canada and the European Union in banning Russian aircraft from U.S. airspace. This could impact getting OneWeb satellites built in Florida to Russia for these planned launches.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Transportation and its Federal Aviation Administration issued orders blocking Russian aircraft and airlines from entering and using all domestic U.S. airspace. According to the FAA, the ban goes into effect by the end of Wednesday, effectively closing U.S. air space to all Russian commercial and civil aircraft.  Early Thursday morning OneWeb released a statement saying the board had voted to suspend all launches from the Baikonur.

It's been a busy launch week on Florida's Space Coast after NOAA's new weather satellite GOES-T blasted off on Tuesday, and two days later SpaceX sent up another round of Starlink satellites.  A Falcon 9 lifted off from Launchpad 39A at 9:25 a.m. Re-watch the launch at the top of this story.  It was a pleasant day for a launch on Florida's east coast. Launch officers with the Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron gave a 90% chance of favorable conditions for liftoff.  According to SpaceX, there were 47 Starlink satellites inside the rocket nose cone bound for low-Earth orbit. The rocket booster has previously launched seven other dedicated Starlink missions and three other missions for SpaceX customers.  About 8 minutes after launch, the booster once again returned to Earth, landing for the 11th time on the Just Read the Instructions droneship in the Atlantic Ocean.  SpaceX also plans to collect the rocket fairing halves that make up the nose cone using its recovery ship called "Bob."  This launch marks the second Starlink launch in under a week. SpaceX launched 50 internet satellites from California on Friday.  SpaceX has been busy in the first three months of the year. Thursday's launch is the ninth Falcon 9 mission this year.  Elon Musk's company will continue launching Starlink satellites at a rapid cadence as it builds the constellation of spacecraft to beam internet to anywhere in the world, even remote communities. Musk recently said that more than 250,000 Starlink user terminal orders had been fulfilled.  Earlier this week, Musk sent a shipment of Starlink user terminals to Ukraine to help with communication issues after Russia invaded.  SpaceX engineer Siva Bharadvaj said during the launch live stream that Starlink has been activated in Ukraine and government officials confirmed the kits are already in use.  "Thank you, and we hope it helps," Bharadvaj said.

New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote in a Wednesday op-ed that President Joe Biden's call for the funding of police during his State of the Union address felt like "a callous attempt to appease the law-and-order crowd."  "We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training. Resources and training they need to protect their communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe," Biden said in his speech on Tuesday.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION REPORT CARD: EXPERTS GIVE THEIR GRADES  Blow argued that providing police systems with more funding at a time when police reform is necessary would "serve to buttress the brokenness." The columnist also noted an April 28, 2021, speech by the president after his first 100 days in office, during which he called for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing act.  He called for America to come together to "rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve." Blow said Biden "performed a political pirouette and ended up facing the wrong direction."  The New York Times writer said talks on the police reform bill ended in September and that Biden had said he would sign an executive order with similar laws.  "Mr. President, it’s March. We are still waiting for you to issue that executive order," Blow wrote.  "Race, as a word, magically disappeared from your rhetorical repertoire. Why? I assume because the political winds have shifted. What polled well last spring isn’t polling well this spring," Blow said, noting Biden didn't bring up race in his State of the Union address.  For instance, Blow praised Biden's historic nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, but said that the president didn't note during his speech that she, if confirmed, will be the first Black woman sitting on the bench.  Blow also criticized Biden for not fighting hard enough to get the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act passed. He said after the legislation didn't pass the Senate in January, Biden promised he would keep fighting to get this legislation passed, but has not mentioned it since its failure in Congress. Blow suggested that some might "defend" Biden because he has "the most diverse cabinet in history."  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Voters in mostly Democratic cities largely rejected local reforms and candidates that called for defunding the police. In Minneapolis, voters rejected an amendment that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a Department of Public Safety. They also reelected their mayor, who opposed the measure. In the Seattle mayoral race, a candidate that supported cutting police funding in half lost.  Biden's State of the Union address focused on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, rising inflation and more. Some of what he said garnered bipartisan support and applause, such as his calls for securing the border and beating the opioid epidemic.

Hours before Russia’s deadly air assault began, host Jessica Rosenthal spoke to Fox News strategic analyst General Jack Keane and Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Amy Kellogg about what events led up to the attack and what politically and culturally pressures could have driven President Vladimir Putin to make this world-shattering decision.  Retired four-star general Keane discussed President Putin past attempts to use violence to win control over the country of Ukraine and what his motivations could be.  Kellogg, who is currently in Moscow, discussed how the Russian people feel about their President’s desire to reestablish Russia’s power over Ukraine and his rationalizations to use military force.  Due to time limitations, we could not include all of the interview in our original segment. On the FOX News Rundown Extra, you will hear our entire conversations with both General Kean and Amy Kellogg and get more perspective on the War in Ukraine.

However, there are signs diplomacy could still work. Fox News Senior Field Producer Yonat Friling joins the Rundown to discuss how Russian conflict with the U.S. may be less severe than many Americans fear. Friling also breaks down what’s happening in other parts of the globe, from the attempted ballistic missile attack in Abu Dhabi and more signs that the threat of ISIS is still very real.

Waltz also addressed reports that the KGB can track and target Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when he addressed his people through his mobile phone and the internet. Waltz says the KGB are some of the best in the world in their cyber tracking. Waltz fears every time Zelenskyy is broadcasting he is putting his life on the line and we will see the screen go black because of a Russian cruise missile coming through the window.

Brady believes President Biden’s decision earlier this year not to get Ukraine surface to air missiles is coming back to haunt Ukraine. Brady also discussed how President Biden at tonight’s State of the Union has to end all the emergency COVID programs that discourage Americans from coming back to work, drop the tax increases that drive up inflation and hurt workers. Brady also stressed the need to start prioritizing workers instead of spending half a trillion dollars on the Green New Deal subsidies.

Prince said the Russians expected a cake walk and they have been put in a bad sandwich instead. Prince believes this was all preventable and points to the national command authorities in America for lacking any kind of imagination and the ability to come up with a different plan or accept a different plan despite all their talk of diversity. Prince says they only think within their beltway bubble which is extremely dangerous. Prince is pleasantly surprised that the Germans have come around to help Ukraine. Even more surprising to Prince is the Swiss sanctioning Russia because they didn’t even sanction Hitler. Prince also broke down a plan he offered the Biden administration back in December that was rejected which would have helped Ukraine prevent the Russians from invading.

During his 62-minute speech, the President touched on a variety of issues, including the situation in Ukraine, inflation, the American tax system, securing the Southern border, crime and COVID-19. Rep. Brady thinks Biden’s plan to fix inflation by lowering costs as opposed to wages does not make any sense.  “I think he’s just divorced from reality when it comes to the economy. And you know, if you’re a family worried about high prices, you’ve just given back three years of your gains that you got under President Trump, you heard nothing that’s going to help you lower those prices. If you’re a small businessperson struggling to find workers to keep your doors open, you heard nothing last night to address this. In fact, if anything, I think his obsession with Build Back Better, there’s no question that spending will drive up inflation. The tax hikes will end up in higher prices and be an economic surrender to Russia, to China, Europe and others. And so yeah, he’s just stuck on that. And I’ll be honest, he doesn’t understand the economy, just as when he and in President Obama were in office. That’s why my conclusion, just watching the speech, it just struck me. You know, all Americans, especially people of color, prospered in the economy under President Trump. All Americans, especially people of color, are suffering in the economy under President Biden.”  Later, Georgia Republican Congressman Drew Ferguson checks in and tells Jimmy why Biden’s energy policies are hurting our country, especially in light of the current war between Russia and Ukraine.

His on his own Democrat base is withering away. I mean, one of the most extreme examples of that is that the Democratic Party is now so divided that there are going to be two responses to Biden’s State of the Union tonight, one from the far Left and one from a moderate. That tells you that really all the kind of turmoil that we have suffered in this country politically for the past several years really has its roots in the fact that the Democratic Party has been taken over by a tiny Left-Wing radical rump, and they are destroying the party. And you’ll see, I’m sure that Joe Biden tonight is going to gaslight us with, you know, Jen Psaki telegraphed it with this idea that he’s been a great President, that inflation is not a problem, that any inflation there is is the fault of Vladimir Putin and that he himself has done a magnificent job uniting not only in the nation but the world. And no one believes that because their lived experience tells them the opposite, particularly when it comes to hip pocket issues. But Joe Biden is not speaking to all of America. He’s speaking to his tiny Left-Wing base.”  Later, Professor of Business and Economics at The King’s College in Manhattan Brian Brenberg stops by to discuss the Biden administration’s misguided strategy when it comes to America’s oil and gas supply. He and Jimmy also push back on the President’s attempts to spin the current state of our country’s economy.  Listen to the podcast to hear what else Miranda and Brian had to say!

Senator McConnell said he asked Judge Jackson her position on court-packing, but didn’t receive an answer saying,  “I did emphasize to her. I thought it was one thing she could safely address and people would welcome hearing. And that’s the same thing that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer said about court-packing. Both of whom made it clear that it was a bad idea and was an attack on the integrity of the court and its independence. I didn’t get an answer to that, but I’m sure she’ll be asked that again in her hearings before the Judiciary Committee.”  Full Transcript:  GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Well, joining us now is Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.  Senator, it’s great to have you on the show. Welcome back.  SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Sure. Glad to be with you, Guy.  BENSON: Just your overall thoughts, you were in the chamber, of course, last night. The cameras were fixed on you a couple times. What were your initial reactions? You’ve now had, you know, almost a day to digest it a bit more. Your takeaways from the president last night?  MCCONNELL: On Ukraine, I think the tone was a little too self-congratulatory. I think we all know the inspiration is being provided by the courageous Ukrainian people and their incredible leader who are literally inspiring the rest of the world with their bravery and have produced, you know, clearly the total different reaction from NATO that — that Putin predicted.  I mean, who would have ever thought the Germans — I mean, even in a coalition that includes the Green Party, would completely reverse their policies over the last few decades not only on energy but also on the exportation of weapons directly to Ukraine, doubling their defense budget and saying they’re going to get to 2 percent of GDP as rapidly as possible. Who would have ever thought Finland and Sweden would be saying maybe we need to get in NATO? I think from a — from a NATO perspective, Putin has produced more unity and resolve than any of the previous administrations I can think of regardless of party.  BENSON: So that was the opening portion of the president’s speech on Ukraine and Russia. A lot of unity in the room, if a bit too self-congratulatory, to use your phrase. He then moved on to the rest of the speech that just kind of felt like a hodgepodge to me, where he was jumping from one topic to another pretty quickly, not a lot of transitions. And it didn’t feel fresh, or trying to turn over a new leaf, or turn the page on what has been a very tough first year for him as president. It was a lot of — more of the same. It felt like he was giving us maybe a little bit of a reminder tour of the greatest hits that weren’t able to pass Congress. Saying, well, why don’t you go pass the Democratic takeover of our elections and pass big elements of Build Back Better? I wonder what you think of that, given that that’s certainly not new and it seems almost quixotic given what’s already happened in recent months.  MCCONNELL: Yes, you know what I was thinking as I sat there and listened to that, Guy, was how Bill Clinton reacted when he got his butt handed to him in the ’94 election. This — the next State of the Union message started off by saying, incredibly, “The era of big government is over.” That’s my definition of a pivot. You know, Biden ran as a moderate. But he’s not been a moderate. And so and the — it was more of the same. The same old stuff they tried to pass last year they’re still advocating, nothing new there whatsoever. I think it was a lost opportunity for him to indicate he maybe heard the voices of the American people. They have been expressed, they were expressed in Virginia and in New Jersey. But I think the message was we’ll stay the course.  BENSON: By the way, speaking of Virginia there’s a new poll out this week of Virginia voters. And Glen Youngkin compared to President Biden has a net 22-point popularity advantage over President Biden in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He’s plus nine, the governor is, and the president is minus 12 on job approvals. So — and that’s in a blue state. So that helps sort of paint the picture of the national environment that this president is dealing with, that his party is dealing with. Last question on the State of the Union last night, Senator, it’s a two-parter. There’s been a fair amount of media attention to the backbencher House of Representatives member on the Republican side who, at one point, heckled the president about American deaths in Afghanistan. In your view, is that an appropriate thing to do, A? And then, B, what do you think of the president and his team’s decision not to even mention Afghanistan at all in those remarks which spanned 70 minutes?  MCCONNELL: Well, I guess the reason they didn’t want to mention Afghanistan is it was a debacle. I believe, Guy, that had we not precipitously abandoned Afghanistan, Vladimir Putin wouldn’t have gone into Ukraine. It was the perception of American withdrawal and weakness that emboldened thugs like Putin. But I’m not surprised that Joe Biden didn’t mention Afghanistan. It was, I think, a low point in an otherwise pretty botched up performance all year long.  BENSON: Any comment on the outburst from the Republican Congresswoman?  MCCONNELL: Look, I think civil behavior is a good idea in Congress. We act that way in the Senate. I don’t normally give the House advice. But it seems to me, a respectful response to the State of the Union would be the norm.  BENSON: Earlier today you had an opportunity to meet face-to-face with the new Supreme Court nominee from President Biden, Judge Brown Jackson of the D.C. Circuit, a highly anticipated meeting because of your position, of course, in the Senate, and it’s always all eyes on a Supreme Court vacancy. To the extent that you’re able to talk to us about your perceptions of the nominee, how that meeting went, we’d be very curious to hear.  MCCONNELL: Well, these nominees don’t say much. They’ve all been schooled going back to Ruth Bader Ginsburg not to really answer much of anything. But I think she’s an intelligent — very likely a progressive. The Senate Republican Minority intends to treat the nominee respectfully. I’m not at all interested, for example, in what somebody may have written in her high school yearbook. I did emphasize to her I thought it was one thing she could simply address, and people would welcome hearing, and that’s the same thing that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer said about court-packing, both of whom made it clear that was a bad idea and was attacked — an attack on the integrity of the — of the — of the court and its independence. I didn’t get an answer to that. But I’m sure she would be asked that again in her hearings before the Judiciary Committee.  BENSON: Setting aside her worldview, and I think if she makes it to the court, I think it’s likely that she’ll be confirmed given the math and the dynamics. I — I’ll probably end up disagreeing with much of her jurisprudence and her rulings over the course of her time on the court. But setting that aside, do you think at least in terms of her C.V. is she qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court?  MCCONNELL: Yes, yes. No question about that.  BENSON: Last question, Senator McConnell. There has been some reporting in D.C. about some backroom drama within the Senate Republican Conference over the NRSC Chairman this cycle, Rick Scott from Florida, putting out, sort of, an agenda that largely is popular with the American people. But there is one tax provision that would give Democrats an opening to attack Republicans. And there are reports that you have been critical of including that in this public agenda that he put out there and that there’s perhaps a bit of disagreement happening behind the scenes. I think Republican and conservative voters, who might like you and Senator Scott, without making it personal at all, they just feel like the Republican Party needs to not blow it this cycle. And there’s a huge opportunity to win and maybe even win big in the midterm elections. Can they be confident that this type of skirmish will be resolved relatively quickly, and the party is going to be focused and united heading into November?  MCCONNELL: Well, yes. I think so. I think it’s important to remember that this election is going to be a referendum on the performance of this entirely Democratic government. And it’s also important to the extent that we begin to talk about what a new Senate Republican majority would do, to make it clear that we’re not going to raise taxes and to make it clear that we’re not going to sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. Not only would that be a disastrous government policy, it would lead to having it fall — be a referendum on us rather than them.  BENSON: And if it’s just a referendum on them, based on some of the polling data that I just referenced a few minutes ago, I think it’d be, perhaps, a very rough night ahead for the Democratic Party in November. You predicted last time we spoke that Republicans are in the driver’s seat, House and Senate, for November. We’ll revisit that in the weeks and months to come as we have you back. Senator McConnell, always appreciate it. Thank you so much.  MCCONNELL: Thank you, Guy.  BENSON: And we’ll be right back after this.  END

Gen. Keane gave his analysis of the ongoing war saying,  “Yeah, I mean, that is that is the question that none of us know in Russian capability and the strategic issues here, you know, have been able to answer satisfactorily other than the fact that this is one of the most significant miscalculations. Certainly that has been made in our lifetime by a nation-state who was used to using force and certainly has excellent intelligence services in both civilian and military. And yet can so profoundly fail to grasp the implications of what taking charge of the country means to them. You’re absolutely right. I mean this that the Ukrainians will fight them as long as there are Russians on their soil. And I think it puts Putin really on a potential path to some kind of removal from Russia over time, not immediately, but over time as the sanctions take toll.”

I don’t think the world has ever been in a situation this dangerous. You are dealing with a an erratic leader. All of the world leaders who have met with him in recent weeks, whether it was the Finnish president or the French president, have said that he’s changed, that he is isolated, that he’s not in touch with reality and even his own inner circle and the people he relies on. You can see the look of fear on their faces.”

In light of what is happening in Eastern Europe, several Republican lawmakers are urging President Biden to stop relying on Moscow for oil. Lara says this is something former President Trump forcefully advocated for during his time in office.  “Oil is a big deal. And you know who knew that is Donald Trump. That’s why he opened up the Keystone XL pipeline. That’s why he made sure that Nord Stream 2 wasn’t fully available to be opened up to the Europeans because now you see the position, and he warned everybody about this. He was mocked in 2018 for warning Germany, if you’re too reliant on Russian oil, it’s going to put you in a bad spot. And look at the spot they’re in now. Look at the stranglehold that Vladimir Putin and Russia has on Europe, on most of the world. So why wouldn’t we want to make it ourselves here? Why wouldn’t we want to be energy independent? None of it makes any sense. You know, they always talk about climate change and it being greener. Well, the trucks that are having to transport the oil that we’re having shipped to our country across America are causing much more issue with the environment than a pipeline would. None of it makes sense. But yet again, just another reason we’ve got to have somebody that’s got some common sense in there. A lot of people say that would be Donald Trump.”  Later, Founder and Executive Director of Power The Future Daniel Turner breaks down the issues with the Biden administration being overly reliant on Russia for oil imports.

Johnson says the Russian army is not as effective as Putin thought and that might be because of the low morale of the Russian soldiers. Johnson is hoping and praying for President Zelinsky, and believes he has shown true leadership, true courage. Johnson thinks Zelinsky’s leadership is one of the factors in terms of why Ukrainians are standing strong against Russia. Johnson also discussed the need to recognize that the sanctions are not working because too many countries are still dependent on Russian oil which they still continue to sell. Senator Johnson thinks the biggest blunder was the reluctance of the West, including the US, to fully arm Ukraine.

I’ve been coming since I was in college. I went to my first CPAC, I was literally a kid in college at Georgetown University. I considered myself a nerd. I take that with a badge of pride because I was just obsessed with politics. And I went on over to CPAC, it was just outside of Washington DC. I found a whole lot of people who love this country, who take days out of their schedule to show up. We are the cool kids.”  Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds talks about the experience of being at CPAC, and why the Republican Party has all the momentum in Washington DC right now.
